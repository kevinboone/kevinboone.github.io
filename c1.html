<h1 id="they-dont-make-them-like-that-any-more-the-bmw-c1">They don’t
make them like that any more: the BMW C1</h1>
<p><img src="img/c1_logo.jpg" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>BMW’s C1 was among the most innovative motor vehicles ever produced,
and one of the Company’s biggest commercial failures. Many people, I
guess, have never even seen a C1, much less had the pleasure of driving
one. In this article I’ll explain what made the C1 special, and
speculate on why it failed.</p>
<p>BMW released the C1, with considerable fanfare, in the year 2000.
Superficially, and legally, it was a motorcycle, but in many ways it
handled more like a car. I’m sure BMW positioned the C1 as an
alternative to a car, rather than as a bike or scooter. It was sold by
BMW car dealers, not alongside the Company’s motorcycle range.</p>
<p>There were two C1 models, and I owned one of each. The smaller model
had a 125cc engine, so anybody over the age of 17 could ride it with
only one day’s training. If you already had a licence to drive a car,
you didn’t need any additional paperwork. The larger C1 was advertised
as “200cc” but, in fact, the engine capacity was only about 180cc.
Still, you needed a full motorcycle licence to drive this model. The
“200” was much faster than its smaller counterpart and, more
importantly, smooth-running at highway speeds. If you were brave, you
could even tackle motorways in it – but this was never an agreeable
experience. The C1 was really an urban vehicle.</p>
<p><img src="img/c1.png" /></p>
<p>There were, and are, many models of motorcycle. There are also
motorcycles with roof canopies: the C1 wasn’t an innovation in that
respect. What made the C1 unique was that its roof was continuous with
its frame, making up a continuous, steel roll cage. BMW designed the C1
to be ridden without protective clothing. They even released a video
recording of somebody driving one into a brick wall, and walking away
unscathed. As well as the roll cage, there were huge side bumpers, in
case the vehicle fell over in a crash. These were useful when it fell
over spontaneously, too – more on that later.</p>
<p>In the days when I wore a business suit to work, I could drive my C1
to the office in my working clothes: no leathers, no crash helmet.
Outside of work, I could even drive it, with reasonable safety, in jeans
and T-shirt. Of course, some people ride an ordinary motorcycle in such
clothing, and that’s fine: we need more organ donors. Being able to
travel safely in lightweight clothing was a big deal, when stuck in
traffic on a sunny day. I could wear exactly the same clothing in a
rainstorm, and stay dry.</p>
<p>The C1 was inexpensive to run – not as cheap as a regular motorcycle
of the same engine size, but hugely more economical than a car. It
wasn’t as manoeuvrable as a regular motorcycle but, again, it was much
more nimble than a car. In London, I could thread a C1 through the gaps
between the stationary lanes of rush-hour traffic. I could also park it
in motorcycle bays or, if all else failed, on the pedestrian pavement.
It’s near-impossible to park a car in the City of London, but parking a
motorcycle is nearly always possible.</p>
<p>There simply was no better way to travel around a city than on a C1.
It was fun, economical, hassle-free, safe, rainproof, easy to park, and
quick. In short, I loved my C1s, and I was devastated when BMW announced
that they were discontinuing production after only two years.</p>
<p>How could such a thing happen? The C1 appeared to be a success – when
I used mine to commute in London, I would see plenty of other C1s. It’s
not as if people weren’t buying them; but, clearly, not in sufficient
numbers. What went wrong?</p>
<p>I think BMW’s biggest mistake was to underestimate people’s inherent
conservatism. Buying and running a motor vehicle is a big commitment –
people are likely to stick with what they know. Although BMW sold the C1
as an alternative to a car, my experience was that most owners had
experience with motorcycles. If you’ve never ridden a motorcycle, I
imagine the C1 would have been a bit daunting. It was daunting, in some
ways, even for experienced motorcyclists.</p>
<p>This conservatism extended itself to motorcycle dealers and
mechanics. The only place you could buy a new C1 was from a BMW car
dealership. Regular motorcycle dealers occasionally had a used one, but
they didn’t really know what to do with it. They didn’t want to service
C1s, that’s for sure. You can buy a motorcycle from Honda or Yamaha, and
take it to a Suzuki garage for routine servicing. The only time I took
my C1 to a regular motorcycle garage for servicing, the mechanic said
“That was fun. Please don’t come again.” So, for servicing, I had to
take my C1s to a BMW car dealer, of which there were only a handful in
London. This was a major inconvenience.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that BMW advertised the C1 to the wrong crowd. All
their advertising showed glamorous twenty-somethings shuttling between
designer clothes outlets and coffee shops. The typical C1 owner was
always going to be a sensible parent with a day-job. Car advertisers
have kind-of figured this out now: showing a young couple engaged in
intimate relations on a car hood doesn’t really sell family saloons. BMW
must have known what its target market had to be, but its advertisers
didn’t reach those people.</p>
<p>It also has to be admitted that the C1 was weird, and ugly. Our
society has a low tolerance for weird, ugly things, whatever advantages
they seem to possess.</p>
<p>Although it pains me to say it, I have to admit that the C1 wasn’t
perfect. The roof was a wind-trap, especially on open roads, and
particularly in side winds. A sudden gust of wind could see the C1
thrown across three lanes of a highway. In fact, strong winds could blow
the C1 over even when standing still – it was pretty top-heavy. I had
some terrifying experiences, driving the C1 in gales.</p>
<p>It was heavy, too, compared to a traditional motorcycle. If it did
blow over, even though it didn’t seem to do the C1 any harm, it was
horrible to right it again single-handedly. The extra weight didn’t help
with acceleration, either. The C1 was faster away from traffic lights
than almost any car, despite its meagre engine, but even a 50cc scooter
would leave it standing. The 200cc version would cruise at 60-70 mph,
but it would take a while to get there.</p>
<p>Another enemy of the C1 was Britain’s hidebound legal system.
Although the C1 was safe – as safe as a car – to ride without protective
clothing, it was nevertheless treated as a motorcycle for legal
purposes. That meant you were supposed to wear a crash helmet, even
though doing so probably <em>reduced</em> the safety, as your torso was
firmly strapped into the roll cage. To their credit, the police in my
region never complained when I drove my C1 without a helmet, although
they often stopped me out of interest.</p>
<p>The C1 wasn’t cheap to buy. It was cheaper than a BMW car, but
expensive for a motorcycle. Sadly, people don’t seem to be willing to
pay for extra safety. If you don’t care about safety, a regular
motorcycle offers many advantages over a C1: an ordinary motorcycle will
be cheaper to buy and run, easier to handle, and you can buy one
anywhere. These are compelling advantages, if you don’t have much
money.</p>
<p>In practice, I almost never saw a C1 outside London. Not surprising,
perhaps, because travelling in London is a soul-crushing experience.
Public transport is expensive and lamentably awful, and private cars are
stationary most of the time. Bicycle and motorcycle still represent the
only remotely tolerable means of transport, and both require nerves of
steel. Plenty of people live and work in London, but perhaps not enough
to support a novel car-motorcycle industry. Transport in other UK cities
is awful, but perhaps not yet awful enough to make people consider novel
transport options.</p>
<p>So that was the C1: a practical, cost-effective means of urban
transport, that few had the good sense to buy. Nothing like it has been
produced since, and perhaps nothing will again.</p>
<p>Unless…</p>
<p>The transport situation in Britain’s cities gets worse and worse and,
to compound the problem, the Government is keen to get rid of the
polluting internal combustion engine. If we’re all going to have to
switch over to electric vehicles, perhaps that will give us the
incentive to switch over to completely new kinds of vehicle? I’ve heard
rumours that BMW is considering producing an electric motorcycle of
similar design to the C1. If this ever happens, I’ll be first in line to
get one.</p>
<p>If I can afford it.</p>
