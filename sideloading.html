restrictions on Android: how big a deal will they be?</h1>
<p><img src="img/degoogle.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<h2 id="what-is-sideloading">What is ‘sideloading’?</h2>
<p>Let’s start by defining out terms. ‘Sideloading’ is a word used in
the smartphone world for what would simply be called ‘installing
software’ anywhere else. The term ‘sideloading’ has a pejorative ring to
it, as if people who indulge in it are doing something sketchy. We don’t
‘sideload’ software on Windows, or Linux, or anything else – we merely
‘install’ it. In the smartphone world, though, ‘sideloading’ software
has come mean obtaining it from some source not officially sanctioned by
the vendor.</p>
<p>A smartphone sits at the intersection of two worlds: in one it’s a
consumer item, like a television or a washing machine; in the other,
it’s a shockingly powerful computing device. This combination of
mass-market pricing and great power makes the smartphone an ideal tool
for storing and managing large amounts of personal data, which in turn
makes it a target for villains and scammers.</p>
<p>A desktop computer still has some of the air of a specialist
computing device about it, something that a smartphone lacks, however
many gigabytes of RAM it boasts. So when we install software on a
desktop or laptop computer, there’s a tacit understanding that we have
some clue what we’re doing. Smartphone vendors cannot make such
assumptions about their customers: the majority of handset owners have
no clue at all what they’re doing.</p>
<p>This is what makes ‘sideloading’ sound a little subversive, even
seedy: if you, the user, have no clue, then you must rely on the
smartphone vendor to protect you from your own folly, or face the
consequences. To be fair, desktop computing is going a similar way:
there are ‘approved’ sources of software, even for Linux. I’m sure the
majority of people get the bulk of their Android apps from the official
Google Play Store, and won’t be concerned about – or even notice – any
changes in Google’s app distribution policies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note</em><br />
In case it isn’t obvious, I loathe the term ‘sideloading’, and will
always write it with its sneer-quotes. I only continue to use it because
everybody else does.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-sideloading-is-important">Why ‘sideloading’ is
important</h2>
<p>‘Sideloading’ software remains a common practice in the Android
world, for all sorts of reasons. The fact that Android continues to
allow the installation of unsanctioned apps distinguishes it from the
Apple platform, which has been restricted to vendor-approved software
from day one.</p>
<p>Software that does not have the approval of the handset vendor, or
some other tech giant, may be dodgy, or it may equally be perfectly
legitimate. There are perfectly sound reasons for Android apps not to be
available from official, Google-approved channels. Consider system-wide
ad-blockers, for example. Google won’t allow such things in its store –
not for technical reasons, but because blocking advertisements is not in
Google’s business interests.</p>
<p>Then there’s specialized and experimental software, which has no
reason to be distributed widely. Dealing with Google’s Play Store is
administratively burdensome, and getting harder. There’s also a fee to
enrol as an app developer – it’ not a large fee, but it’s one I don’t
intend to pay, just so I can give away open-source apps free of charge.
It’s not surprising that hobbyists and small-volume producers don’t want
the hassle of dealing with Google, irrespective of the costs.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-changing">What is changing?</h2>
<p>A few months ago Google announced that Android was going to start
blocking the installation of software from unidentified sources, leading
to the expected wailing and rending of garments. This was the end, it
was lamented, of Android’s customary openness. Having achieved a
dominating position in the tech market, Google was now going to use that
position to stifle competition. And so on. And on.</p>
<p>Before we all throw our Android devices in the trash and move
wholesale to Apple – which has <em>never</em> had any openness – it’s
worth thinking more coolly about what’s going on here.</p>
<p>First – at present, at least – Google is not seeking to restrict
software supply to its own Play Store. It will still be possible to
distribute APK files, using whatever channels already exist, and it will
still be possible (in theory) to operate an alternative app store.
However, Android will refuse to install an APK unless it has been
cryptographically signed using the certificate of a registered
developer.</p>
<p>Of course, ‘registered’ here means ‘registered with Google’. This
isn’t a small change, to be sure, but it’s not the end of the world. In
particular, there’s no sign <em>at present</em> that Google intends to
restrict what apps can be supplied according to their purpose. So far as
I know, it will still be possible to distribute, say, a system-wide
ad-blocker – you’ll just need to do it as a registered developer.</p>
<p>Second, there’s no sign at present that Android will restrict apps
installed using the ADB utility. I’d argue that if you’re technically
savvy enough to install an app from an APK file, you’re knowledgeable
enough to do it using ADB. It’s less convenient, to be sure, but not a
show-stopper.</p>
<p>Still, these changes <em>will</em> reduce the openness of the Android
platform, and it’s worth thinking about the threats they are claimed to
counter, and whether they actually will.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-risks-of-sideloading">What are the risks of
‘sideloading’?</h2>
<p>Installing <em>any</em> software, whatever its origin, has risks.
Almost certainly these risks are worse when the source of the software
is obscure. Preventing users installing software with an unidentifiable
origin seems reasonable, at least at first blush.</p>
<p>Just this month, we’ve heard that the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF)
has issued an edict banning senior army officers from using Android
phones. Although details are vague, it appears that some officers were
tricked into downloading malicious apps following a campaign on
WhatsApp. So far as we know, the bogus apps weren’t exploiting any
subtle security vulnerability in Android: they simply exposed users’
contacts and photos, which any app can do, with the user’s
permission.</p>
<p>It isn’t hard to see how access to this kind of information is
valuable for an adversary. Of course, the factor that seems to be
overlooked here is that the user has to grant permissions to the app,
and too many smartphone users just click the ‘OK’ button without much
thought.</p>
<h2 id="will-the-planned-changes-address-the-risks">Will the planned
changes address the risks?</h2>
<p>If Google restricted Android users to installing software with a
known source, could an intrusion like the one that concerned the IDF
still happen? I suspect it could. The information that Google insists on
seeing to register a developer varies between jurisdictions but, in the
UK at least, it can all be faked. I find it hard to believe that a
person or organization who can create a malicious Android app, and run a
social engineering campaign to get people to install it, couldn’t also
fake up a driver’s licence and a utility bill. To be sure, spoofing
Google’s checks will be a faff, but a faff that a true bad actor will be
willing to undertake.</p>
<p>It’s also worth asking why the IDF (or any military organization) was
vulnerable to a dodgy app at all. A family member who works for an
airline has an “official” smartphone. It does telephony, and runs the
airline’s own apps for rostering and so on. Other than that,
<em>nothing</em> can be installed on it. Even the web browser is locked
to the airline’s web portal. I presume that arrangements like this are
commonplace in environments where security is a concern. My most recent
employer was adamant that, if an employee needed a smartphone for
business, he or she would be issued one – and I wasn’t working with
military data. It blows my mind, frankly, that the IDF allows its senior
commanders to use regular, mass-market cellphones in the course of their
duties at all, regardless of vendor.</p>
<p>My guess is that Google is more concerned about mundane, less
consequential risks than defence secrets being stolen. Many people use
smartphones for banking and payments, for example. Without control over
the supply of software, there’s a real risk of installing a trojan app,
something that imitates a real banking app, but just collects up user’s
authentication credentials. Again, though, I have to wonder whether
Google’s sideloading policy will really help. To be effective it would
again have to be the case that a person with the technical knowledge to
write and deploy the offending app could not fake an ID that would fool
Google’s checks.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-so-many-people-so-bothered-about-all-this">Why are so
many people so bothered about all this?</h2>
<p>I don’t write or maintain many Android apps. Those I do
(intentionally) make me no money. Signing up as a Google registered
developer will cost me money – not a lot, but more money than I stand to
make. More than that, being concerned about Google’s intrusions into my
privacy, I don’t want to give Google any more information about me.
Registering as a developer will require me to give an unambiguous
indication of my real-world identity, including my home address. Maybe
Google has already worked that out – it’s pretty good at profiling – but
I’m not going to give Google any more help if it hasn’t.</p>
<p>Google’s verification won’t just affect developers: the process of
checking the origin of an app will tell Google which apps a user has
installed. This provides Google with a further data point for its
invasive profiling process.</p>
<p>I suspect concerns about privacy are at the root of most objections
to Google’s new policy. However, there is the more mundane matter of
annoyance. I just don’t want the hassle of dealing with Google’s
verification process. As I don’t stand to make any money from doing it,
this is all just time wasted for me, and I’m not getting any
younger.</p>
<h2 id="are-the-changes-inevitable">Are the changes inevitable?</h2>
<p>I think it’s unlikely that Google will completely roll back its plans
for developer verification. However, in the last week Google’s leaders
have suggested that they might institute some kind of weaker
verification for expert users (who, presumably, know the risks). It will
almost certainly be more difficult to install an APK than it currently
is, and it’s not clear whether alternative app stores will be able to
take advantage of the new, less rigorous proposal.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, that Google is willing to take users’ objections into
account at all is a good sign; Google hasn’t shown itself to be very
responsive to customer opinion in the past.</p>
<h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h2>
<p>Google is in a tricky position. Android’s popularity makes it a
colossal attack surface for villains. Any security weaknesses are
exploited very quickly, and Android is criticised for its openness as
often as it is praised. I’m sure that Google would restrict software
supply to its own Play Store if it could, but this would raise eyebrows
in those organizations tasked with preventing anti-competitive
measures.</p>
<p>It’s easy to understand why Google felt it had to do something about
the prevalence of rogue apps. What it’s chosen to do probably won’t help
much, and will damage privacy. Still, I don’t think it’s the catastrophe
that many Android enthusiasts are fearing. Even if the weakened
verification procedure for expert users proves to be unworkable, there’s
still ADB.</p>
<p>In the end, though, the best way to avoid these planned restrictions
is to avoid handset vendors’ implementations of Android completely.
There’s no reason to think that the upcoming changes will affect
Lineage, Calyx, Graphene, or any other non-vendor firmware.</p>
