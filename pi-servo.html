<h1>The costs and benefits of software pulse-width modulation on the Raspberry Pi</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/pi.png" 
  alt="Pi logo"/>
Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is a simple method of digital-to-analog
conversion, that works by producing a train of pulses of variable width.
These pulses are typically smoothed by a low-pass filter to produce
the analog voltage. Where PWM is used for applications like controlling
the brightness of a lamp or the speed of a motor, it may not even be 
necessary to smooth 
the pulses -- physics or biology will do it
automatically. PWM is also used for controlling the position of
the shaft of a servo motor -- a very important application in robotics
and model-making.
</p>
<p>
The Raspberry Pi has no built-in analogue outputs, unless we count the
audio output. This audio is, in fact, generated by PWM, using the Pi's
only hardware-controlled PWM outputs. These can, in fact, be used
by other applications, but only at the expense of losing audio
capabilities. There are some tricks that can be used to extend the
hardware PWM capabilities but, in practice, if you want multiple
PWM outputs -- for analog signal generation, or some other purpose --
designers frequently fall back on software-controlled PWM.
</p>
<p>
There are libraries for doing PWM, of course. The problem with these
is that it isn't easy to figure out exactly what's going on, and to find 
out whether there are glaring inefficiencies that can be eliminated. This is
important because software PWM has the potential to be <i>grossly</i>
inefficient, if we're not careful. 
</p>
<p>
In this article I outline how to do PWM in software in C, using simple
<code>usleep()</code> operations to do the timing. To control
multiple PWM channels, it's easiest to use a separate thread for
each one. 
</p>
<p>
I'll be showing snippets of code, but not a full application. 
The full application is available
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/pi-servo">in my GitHub repository</a>.
</p>

<h2>GPIO pin control in C -- a review</h2>
<p>
If you're familiar with GPIO access in C, none of this will be new.
</p>
<p>
Other than relying on 3rd party libraries, there are a number of ways of
setting voltages on GPIO pins using C. Probably the simplest -- and the most
portable -- is to use the traditional <code>sysfs</code> interface.
It's rumoured that this interface will be going away, 
but it's not clear what it will be
replaced with, and it's present in every Pi kernel released so far.
The interface has remained substantially the same since the very 
first Pi.
</p>
<p>
All the control points are psuedo-files in the directory
<code>/sys/class/gpio</code>. These aren't real files -- they don't
correspond to any storage -- but they can be read and written as if
they were. 
</p>
<p>
To use a GPIO pin it must be "exported". This amounts to writing
a pin number to <code>/sys/class/gpio/export</code>. Doing this
makes a new directory, specific to the pin, available. For example,
writing "18" makes available the directory 
<code>/sys/class/gpio/gpio18</code>.
</p>
<p>
For our purposes, the two important "files" in this new directory
are <code>direction</code> and <code>value</code>. To make the
pin an output, we write "out" to <code>direction</code>. Then
we can write a "0" or "1" to <code>value</code> to set the voltage
high or low.
</p>
<p>
For present purposes, that's all there is to it. There are a number of
potential inefficiencies in this approach to setting GPIO pins,
some which can be avoided, and some which can't. More on this below. 
</p>

<h2>Basic PWM</h2>
<p>
The basic PWM loop looks like this.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">  <b><font color="#0000FF">while</font></b> <font color="#990000">(!</font>stop<font color="#990000">)</font>
    <font color="#FF0000">{</font>
    <b><font color="#0000FF">if</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>on_usec <font color="#990000">!=</font> <font color="#993399">0</font><font color="#990000">)</font>
      <b><font color="#000000">pwm_set_pin</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>my_pin<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#993399">1</font><font color="#990000">);</font> 
    <b><font color="#000000">usleep</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>on_usec<font color="#990000">);</font>
    <b><font color="#0000FF">if</font></b> <font color="#990000">(!</font>stop<font color="#990000">)</font>
      <font color="#FF0000">{</font>
      <b><font color="#0000FF">if</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>off_usec <font color="#990000">!=</font> <font color="#993399">0</font><font color="#990000">)</font>
        <b><font color="#000000">pwm_set_pin</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>my_pin<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#993399">0</font><font color="#990000">);</font> 
      <b><font color="#000000">usleep</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>off_usec<font color="#990000">);</font>
      <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
    <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
</pre>
<p>
In this sample, <code>on_usec</code> is the length of the time the output
should be high, in microseconds, and <code>off_usec</code> is the time
it should be off, also in microseconds. The function 
<code>pwm_set_pin()</code> does the actual pin setting -- I'll have
more to say about that later. 
</p>
<p>
In the example, I have specific tests for whether the "on" time or
the "off" time are zero. This is because we probably want to be
able to set the PWM output to completely on, or completely off.
Or maybe not -- this depends on the application. In any case,
if we do want to be able to set fully on and fully off, we
don't want to change the GPIO state <i>at all</i>. The reason
is that there a minimum length of time the pin can be changed
for -- this is a limitation in the kernel and I/O. So to 
get full-off or full-on output, we have to avoid changing the 
state completely.
</p>

<h2>Using threads</h2>
<p>
It's much easier to write the rest of the application is we can just
set the PWM to some specific timings, and leave the PWM loop to get on with it.
The easiest way to do this is to to start a new thread to do the
PWM operations. 
</p>
<p>
In essence we need something like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#000080">#include</font></b> <font color="#FF0000">&lt;pthread.h&gt;</font>

<font color="#009900">void</font> <font color="#990000">*</font><b><font color="#000000">loop_start</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#009900">void</font> <font color="#990000">*)</font>
  <font color="#FF0000">{</font>
  <i><font color="#9A1900">// PWM loop goes here</font></i>
  <font color="#FF0000">}</font>

<i><font color="#9A1900">// Start the PWM loop in a thread</font></i>
<font color="#008080">pthread_t</font> pt<font color="#990000">;</font>
<b><font color="#000000">pthread_create</font></b> <font color="#990000">(&amp;</font>pt<font color="#990000">,</font> NULL<font color="#990000">,</font> loop_start<font color="#990000">,</font> NULL<font color="#990000">);</font>
<b><font color="#000000">pthread_detach</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>pt<font color="#990000">);</font> 
<i><font color="#9A1900">// Rest of the application...</font></i>
</pre>

<p>
In practice, if we want to be able to use different multiple PWM
signals, we'll (probably) need to create multiple threads. And then
we'll need some data structures to hold the thread-specific 
details. My sample application shows how I do this but, of course,
it's by no means the only way. 
</p>

<h2>Avoiding inefficiencies (where possible)</h2>
<p>
If your PWM cycle times are of the order of seconds, or even
tenths of a second, inefficiency isn't a huge concern. However,
with cycle times of milliseconds, things get more critical.
It is the PWM loop that requires most of the attention, because this
will potentially be executed thousands of times per second.
</p>
<p>
In my example, it's only the <code>pwm_set_pin</code> function that
allows any scope for optimization. Here's an <i>inefficient</i>
way to implement it.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#000080">#include</font></b> <font color="#FF0000">&lt;pthread.h&gt;</font>

<font color="#009900">void</font> <b><font color="#000000">pwm_set_pin</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#009900">int</font> pin<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#009900">int</font> value<font color="#990000">)</font> 
  <font color="#FF0000">{</font>
  <font color="#009900">char</font> path<font color="#990000">[</font>PATH_MAX<font color="#990000">];</font>
  <b><font color="#000000">sprintf</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>path<font color="#990000">,</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">sizeof</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>PATH<font color="#990000">),</font> <font color="#FF0000">"/sys/class/gpio/gpio%d/value"</font><font color="#990000">,</font> pin<font color="#990000">);</font>
  <font color="#009900">char</font> num<font color="#990000">[</font><font color="#993399">10</font><font color="#990000">];</font>
  <b><font color="#000000">sprintf</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>num<font color="#990000">,</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">sizeof</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>num<font color="#990000">),</font> <font color="#FF0000">"%d"</font><font color="#990000">,</font> value<font color="#990000">);</font> 
  <font color="#009900">int</font> f <font color="#990000">=</font> <b><font color="#000000">open</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>path<font color="#990000">,</font> O_WRONLY<font color="#990000">);</font>
  <b><font color="#000000">write</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>f<font color="#990000">,</font> num<font color="#990000">,</font> <b><font color="#000000">strlen</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>num<font color="#990000">));</font>
  <b><font color="#000000">close</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>f<font color="#990000">);</font>
  <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
</pre>

<p>
Examining all the things that are wrong with this code should give some
ideas about a more efficient implementation.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
The pseudo-file corresponding to a specific pin's value won't change for the
life of the system. It might appear and disappear, but it won't change.
The calculated string could be cached somewhere. But...
</p></li>
<li><p>
There's no need to open and close the <code>value</code> psuedo-file at all. Only 
one thread in one application will be accessing it. The file handle
can simply be stored, and used as required. Of course, we then have
to make provision to close it when the program finishes.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The only meaningful characters that can be written to the <code>value</code>
pseudo-file are the ASCII "0" and "1" codes. 
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
With these things in mind, we can write a much more efficient
implementation.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#009900">void</font> <b><font color="#000000">pwm_set_pin</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#009900">int</font> pin<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#009900">int</font> value<font color="#990000">)</font>

  <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
</pre>

<p>
Of course, what this code doesn't show is all the set-up and tear-down
code that makes it possible. But that's not important, so far as 
efficiency is concerned, because that code is executed only 
infrequently.
</p>
<p>
What are the remaining inefficiencies? There's the function-call
overhead for <code>pwm_set_pin()</code>. This can perhaps be removed by
making the function <code>inline</code> (although the compiler might
do this anyway). Perhaps a few CPU cycles can be shaved off by 
tightening up some of the calculations although, again, the compiler
might do this itself.
</p>
<p>
The inefficiencies we <i>can't</i> remove are those associated with the
kernel syscalls for <code>usleep()</code> and <code>write()</code>. 
Although <code>usleep()</code> does not use any significant CPU
during the sleep time, setting up the sleep takes work. The 
<code>write()</code> function has some processing to do but, again,
because it involves a change in execution context to kernel mode,
there is some unavoidable work to do. There's really no practical
way to avoid the CPU cycles associated with the kernel operations. 
These are small inefficiencies, to be sure -- but they become significant
when they're repeated thousands of times every second.
</p>

<h2>Practical performance</h2>
<p>
Unsurprisingly, the CPU load generated by the PWM process depends
on the number of PWM cycles per second. The table below shows some
test results from my sample program, on a Pi 3B+.
</p>

<table align="center" cellspacing="10px">

<p>
What does this mean in practice? If you wanted to use PWM to control
the colour of a multi-colour LED, you'd need three separate channels
of PWM -- one for each of the individual colours. With a PWM
frequency of 50Hz, most people wouldn't see any flicker. In fact, you'd
probably get away with 20Hz. The total CPU usage created by software
PWM in such a scenario is less than about 2%. 
</p>
<p>
Most small servo motors require a PWM control signal at 50Hz or
thereabouts. Again, software PWM would probably be satisfactory here,
even if controlling several servos at the same time. 
</p>
<p>
You could also use software PCM for, for example, generating a voltage
that would be used to control the gain of an amplifier (with suitable
smoothing of the PWM pulses). A 50Hz PWM frequency would probably
be adequate here -- in fact, 10Hz would probably be adequate, but
it would be harder to smooth nicely. You could almost certainly use
software PWM -- with current amplification -- 
for controlling the speed of a DC motor -- in fact, this
is a very common application. You don't need to smooth the PWM pulses,
because the weight of the moving parts will do that for you. However, 
you'll probably need to fiddle with the PWM frequency to find one that
is effective. If the frequency is too low, the motor will "growl".
It's it's too high, it will whine. There's an optimal frequency for
every motor, that probably needs some experimentation to find.  
</p>
<p>
Generating any kind of analog waveform with a maximum frequency of more
than about 500Hz is probably impractical. It can be done, with 
careful choice of low-pass filter, but the PWM operations will take
a significant fraction of the CPU resources.  
</p>

<h2>Alternatives to software PWM</h2>
<p>
Given the Pi's lack of built-in PWM facilities, it's worth asking
what alternatives there are to doing PWM in software. To some extent
the choice depends on whether you're doing PWM specifically to 
generate pulses of a particular width, or whether you want to smooth
the pulses to create an analog voltage. 
</p>
<p>
For about £5, you can buy an I<sup>2</sup>C PWM controller with 
16 channels, with PWM frequency up to about 2 kHz. 
These devices need only a two-wire connection to the Pi's I<sup>2</sup>C
bus, and usually offer 8-bit or 12-bit resolution in the control of
the pulse width. They aren't usually suitable for analog signal
generation -- they're usually aimed at the model-maker who wants
to control banks of servos. 
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, for about £3 you can get an I<sup>2</sup>C digital-to-analog
converter chip. These devices usually offer 12-bit resolution. They
may operate internally using PWM but, most likely, they will use a
simple 
<a target="_blank"  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor_ladder">resistor ladder</a>.
This allows the device to generate analog voltages as fast 
as the I<sup>2</sup>C bus can supply data. Of course, if 
you don't mind tying up a bunch
of GPIO pins, you can implement a resistor ladder yourself, and this
will be capable of running at very high speeds.
</p>
<p>
In fact, given the low cost and high specification of some of the
alternatives, its actually quite hard to justify using software
PWM at all.
