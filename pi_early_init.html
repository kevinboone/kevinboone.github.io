<h1>Rolling your own minimal embedded Linux for the Raspberry Pi -- part two: early initialization</h1> 

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/pi.png" 
  alt="Pi logo"/>
In the <a href="pi_boot_shell.html">first part of this series</a>,
I explained how to build a minimal Linux from the stock Raspbian 
firmware, that just booted to a root prompt.  
I explained that the only software needed in the root partition was
a shell, and whatever libraries, etc., the shell needed. I suggested
a couple of ways to get a shell -- using the <code>busybox</code> 
package from the Raspbian repository, or using the <code>bash</code>
shell and the various libraries it needs. At this point, your
root filesystem probably contains the <code>/bin</code> directory, 
and perhaps <code>/lib</code>. You may, or may not, have other utilities
like, <code>ls</code>, <code>copy</code>, etc. 
</p>
<p>
I <a href="get_deb.html">also explained</a> how to script a process
that downloaded packages from the Raspbian repository, and unpack
them, along with their dependencies, into a specified staging directory.
The <code>coreutils</code> package would be a good thing to add to your
root filesystem, unless you've got these basic utilities already from
busybox, for example. In an embedded system you may not need these
conventional command-line utilities, but they are helpful for 
troubleshooting.
</p>
<p>
In this article I will explain the next stage of the build -- how to
do the early initialization that is important for preparing the 
system. At the end of this process, we will still only have a root shell,
but we should have something that looks like a feasible 
Linux that has booted into single-user mode. This is, we'll be able
to manipulate files, inspect processes, mount external drives,
that kind of thing. Depending on what packages you install, you might
be able to do simple networking operations using a wired connection.
</p>
<p>
I always use a read-only root filesystem for embedded 
Linux equipment, because I want to be able to switch off without
worrying about shutting anything down. However, running with a
read-only root filesystem does create some complications that have
to be dealt with.
</p>
<p>
I should point out that all I can do in this article is to give general
guidance -- every embedded Linux project is different, and will require
a different set of binaries and a different configuration. 
</p>

<h2>Get essential utilities</h2>

<p>
It's very difficult to do proper initialization of a Linux system in 
application code -- as a minimum, we need a basic set of utilties.
If you installed <code>busybox</code> that you'll already have the basic stuff
but, unless space is really, really limited, it's better to install
the full versions before going much further.
</p>
<p>
I would suggest getting at least the following packages -- and their 
dependencies -- from the Raspbian repository, and installing them in
your root filesystem staging area.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>coreutils</code>. This contains the really fundamental utilities -- <code>cp</code>, <code>ls</code>, etc</p></li>
<li><p><code>mount</code> -- surprisingly, this is not in the <code>core-utils</code> bundle</p></li>
<li><p><code>hostname</code> -- it's good to be able to set the hostname, even if we don't have workable networking at this stage</p></li>
<li><p><code>file</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>bash</code>, or some other fully-featured shell if you've been using Busybox until now</p></li>
<li><p><code>net-tools</code> -- with these utilities it should be possible to
get wired ethernet working, even if wifi will need to be deferred until
later</p></li>
<li><p><code>kmod</code> -- utilities to load and list kernel modules </p></li>
<li><p>The kernel modules your system will need. In the early stages of development, it's probably best to install the full set of modules (from the <code>raspberrypi-kernel</code> package). Eventually you will probably want to
prune this set down to the modules you actually need, which will speed up module little a little. </p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>In case it isn't obvious -- the kernel module package must be a perfect match for the running kernel, down to the last digit in the version numbers</blockquote>

<h2>Plan volatile filesytems and create /etc/fstab</h2>

<p>
This is a crucial step with a read-only root filesystem. Some directories
simply have to be writeable, like <code>/tmp</code>. If you're 
going to run a log daemon, 
then <code>/var/log</code> will also have to be writeable.
With a read-only filesystem, the only way to accomplish this
is to put these directories in RAM. The Pi doesn't have a huge amount
of RAM to start with, so we have to be a bit careful here. In the
end, it's a design decision how much RAM to allocate to in-memory
filesystems.  
</p>
<p>
My preferred approach here -- and it's by no means the only one -- is
to define a conventional <code>/etc/fstab</code> with the relevant
definitions, and just mount the individual directories in the 
shell script that starts the system. This allows me to mount the 
pseudo-filesystems like
<code>/sys</code> and <code>/proc</code> as well.  
</p>
<p>
Here's a typical <code>fstab</code>, allocating 256Mb to <code>/tmp</code>
and <code>50Mb</code> to <code>/var/log</code>.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,size=256M,noatime,nodev,nosuid,mode=1777 0 0
tmpfs /var/log tmpfs defaults,size=50m,noatime,nodev,nosuid,mode=1777 0 0
/dev/mmcblk0p2 / auto defaults,noatime,ro 0 1
/dev/mmcblk0p1 /boot auto defaults,noatime,ro 0 1
proc /proc proc defaults 0 0
sys /sys sysfs defaults 0 0
devpts /dev/pts devpts defaults 0 0
</pre>


<h2>Ensure the staging root filesystem contains mount points for
the volatile filesystems</h2>

<p>
Having the entries in <code>fstab</code> isn't sufficient -- there need to
be places to mount them. If your root filesystem only contains 
<code>/bin</code> at this point, you'll need to add (empty) 
directories <code>/proc</code>, <code>/tmp</code>, <code>/dev</code>,
and <code>/sys</code>. 
</p>
<p>
Some utilities will expect 
<code>/var/run</code> and <code>/run</code> to exist, and to be
writeable. I generally make these symlinks to directories under
<code>/tmp</code> -- that is, in RAM. Although the symlinks themselves
exist in the root filesystem I build, the directories they link
to -- under <code>/tmp</code> -- do not exist at boot time, because
<code>/tmp</code> is in memory. So my start-up script needs to
create these subdirectories of <code>/tmp</code> -- I guess this
only adds a few milliseconds to the boot time.
</p>
<p>
Depending on what your Linux system has to do, you may find other
utilities and applications that need certain directories to be
writable, and these will also need provision made from them. It's 
impossible to give more specific advice that this, because the
details will be entirely application-specific.
</p>

<h2>Create basic networking configuration files</h2>

<p>
This isn't urgent at this early stage, but it's more-or-less the 
minimum needed to get get wired ethernet working. We're not in a
position to use wifi yet, but a wired connection should be workable.
I should
point out that if your application does not require <i>any</i> network
access, this step is not essential.
</p>
<p>
In early stages of testing I always assign a static IP number, even if
I plan to use DHCP later. The IP number will appear in various configuration
files, and I usually write a script to write these network configuration 
files, given some
basic configuration. In the examples that follow, my IP number is
192.168.1.81, and my hostname 'pi'.
</p>

<p>
The file <code>/etc/hostname</code> looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
pi
</pre>

<p>
which is simple enough. <code>/etc/hosts</code> looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
127.0.0.1 localhost
192.168.1.81 pi
</pre>

<p>
I will deal with more sophisticated network configuration in 
a later article.
</p>

<h2>Create the new startup script</h2>

<p>
With the configuration described above, it's easy enough to implement
a script that will do early initialization, and leave us in a state
where we can run basic utilties, and maybe test wired ethernet
connection to local systems. I save this script as
<code>/bin/startup.sh</code>. The script <i>must</i> begin
with a <code>#!</code> to identify the shell, because it will be
executed by the kernel.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
#!/bin/bash
mount /proc
mount /sys
mount /tmp
mkdir /dev/pts
mount /dev/pts
mkdir /tmp/var
mkdir /tmp/run
hostname --file /etc/hostname
exec /bin/bash
</pre>

<h2>Configure the kernel to boot the script</h2>
<p>
Somewhat surprisingly, perhaps, the Linux kernel will boot 
a shell script rather than a binary. That's provided 
the shell actually exists, and can be executed -- but we've
already tested that. So now we just need to modify the 
<code>init=</code> statement in <code>cmdline.txt</code> in
the boot partition:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
... init=/bin/startup.sh
</pre> 

<h2>Burn the SD card and test</h2>

<p>
Copy the boot and root filesystem files to the first and second
partitions of the SD card, and boot the Pi. It almost certainly
won't work, but with luck you will at least have error messages
sufficiently detailed to figure out what files you forgot to 
install ;)
