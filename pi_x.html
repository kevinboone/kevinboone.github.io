<h1>Rolling your own minimal embedded Linux for the Raspberry Pi -- part five: X</h1> 

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/pi.png" 
  alt="Pi logo"/>
This series of articles is about 
building up a custom, minimal Linux installation for the Raspberry
Pi (or similar), for use in an appliance or similar embedded application.
I started in the <a href="pi_boot_shell.html">first article</a> by
describing how to set up the most minimal of Linux installations, that
would boot to a root shell in a kernel console. In subsequent articles
I described how to obtain and set up basic utilities, 
configure service management (using <code>init</code> 
-- no <code>systemd</code> in an application like this), how to 
set up wireless networking, and how to get audio working. All the
while, I've been presuming a hand-crafted set-up, with every userland 
process
that runs being completely under the developers's control. I've assumed
that in an application like this, we would wish to avoid server/desktop
heavy-hitters like<code>systemd</code>, <code>udev</code>, DBus, etc.
A fundamental premise all along has been that the installation would be
mostly read-only -- at least the root filesystem would be read-only,
and requiring no special shut-down procedure.
</p>
<p>
I've also presumed, and will continue to presume, that we're willing
to use existing, compiled binaries from the Raspbian repository, rather
than building everything from source. In a <a href="get_deb.html">related article</a> I described one technique for extracting binaries and their 
dependencies onto a build host, rather than an existing Raspbian system.
That article discussed the advantages and disadvantages of working that
way, rather that compiling everything from source. Fundamentally,
you're trading convenience for installed size, because the packages
in the repository have a high level of "dependency sprawl". But
that's not a point of concern in one-off or small-run embedded projects,
and time-to-completion might be.
</p>
<p>
In this last article in the series, I will describe how to run X-based
graphical applications in an embedded system, without needing a full desktop or
any of the infrastructure that goes with it.
</p>

<h2>Embedded X?</h2>

<p>
It's worth asking whether X is appropriate in an embedded system at all.
After all, it isn't a natural fit -- X is more common on desktops.
I should point out, however, that I'm not talking about running, say,
a web browser or word processor on a Linux appliance. There are many
lightweight, desktop-focused Pi Linux distributions that are designed
for that kind of application -- 
<a href="https://www.dietpi.com/" target="_blank">DietPi</a>
is an example. Rather, I'm considering the practicality or running
one or two, probably customer-written, X applications. 
<img class="article-image" src="img/gxsradio.png" width="400px"
  alt="g x sradio screenshot"/>
</p>
<p>
For example, my 
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/gxsradio">gxsradio</a> application (see screenshot) was 
designed for use on an Internet radio device with a minimal installation
of X and GTK. I wrote it such as to avoid the problems
that arise from the lack of most desktop-related infrastructure.
It isn't always possible to get existing X applications to run in 
a minimal system.
</p>
<p>
If you want to run an application with a graphical user interface
in an embedded system, the real question to ask is: what
alternative is there to X? <code>gxsradio</code> does have a console-based
alternative that works reasonably well -- provided you have a keyboard,
or some hardware method of making key selections. Touch-screen
support in the kernel console is still very difficult. Moreover, the
Linux kernel console has no Unicode support, which is increasingly
a problem in this post-ASCII world.
</p>
<p>
The alternative to X would be to write a graphical application that
interacts directly with the framebuffer and input hardware. There's no
problem in principle with doing this -- it's just very time-consuming
and involved. Even relatively subsidiary problems like rendering
Unicode fonts can be very complicated. To some extent there are open-source
libraries that can be used for this kind of thing but the reality
is, for better or worse, most libraries intended for graphical displays
are designed for X (or its equally heavy alternatives, like Wayland).
</p>
<p>
There was a short-lived project to adapt the GTK libraries to work
directly on a framebuffer, without X. So far as I know, this is not
being developed further. Even SDL doesn't really work without X any more.
For better or worse, for GUI-based
applications X may be the only game in town.
</p>
<p>
People are often reluctant to use X in an embedded project, and 
understandably so. In fact, though, it's not really the basic
X server that is slow and memory-intensive -- it's all the infrastructure
that goes with it. In an embedded application you don't need a 
display manager, or a configuration manager, or perhaps even a
window manager -- mostly you just need a drawing surface and/or 
a basic widget library. I think this is not impractical to implement in
an embedded project.
</p>

<h2>Recap -- how X actually works</h2>

<p>
Twenty years ago it would not have been necessary to explain to a Linux
developer how X works -- everybody knew. Since the rise of the "Linux
desktop", however, the internal operation of X -- which is 
really quite simple -- has become submerged by a heap of 
largely-incomprehensible supporting software. To run X on a Linux
appliance, we really have to get back to basics.
</p>
<p>
The key component of X is the <i>X server</i>. For many years now 
everything that runs X has used the <code>Xorg</code> X server,
that was originally derived from the XFree86 project back in the 90s.
One of the major improvements to the X server since then has been
in the area of auto-configuration -- back in the day, hand-crafting
an X configuration file for all your hardware was the stuff
of nightmares. Unfortunately, a lot of the auto-configuration
support relies on infrastructure like DBus and <code>udev</code>
that won't exist on a minimal system, so to some extent we're going
to be back in the 90s when it comes to set-up -- more on this
later.
</p>
<p>
The role of the X server is to carry out primitive drawing operations
on behalf its clients -- the applications. X was always envisaged as
a client-server protocol and, back in the day, the X server would have
run on a desktop workstation, and its clients on some kind of mainframe.
Although such an architecture hardly exists today, X is still a 
client-server protocol, with <code>Xorg</code> as the server and
the applications as its clients. The X server will communicate with
the display hardware, either via a framebuffer interface provided
by the kernel, or using some more direct method. It will
also communicate with input devices -- mouse, touch panel, etc.
It's conventional to run the X server as <code>root</code>, because
of this close coupling to hardware, but there's rarely a need to
run X <i>clients</i> as <code>root</code>
</p>
<p>
The X server understands the concept of a window, that is, of a
region of screen that belongs to some particular application. Within
that window it can draw lines, shapes, and basic text glyphs; all 
functionality beyond that is supplied by something else.
</p>
<p>
Applications rarely, if ever, communicate with the X server using
its native protocol: they use libraries of varying degrees of
complexity, which usually build on top of one another. These are
typically called 'widget libraries', although the modern ones provide
services that go far beyond handling screen widgets. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
One of the most important X clients in most installations is the
<i>window manager</i>. The basic purpose of a window manager is
to move and re-order windows on behalf of the user. The window
manager will usually 'decorate' windows, that is, draw a box 
around them with various controls. Many window managers provide
application management functions as well -- that is, they provide
ways to start and stop applications, typically using icons or
menus. Some Linux desktop systems delegate these responsibilities to
a separate software component. Some even delegate fundamental window-manager
functions like window decoration to separate components. 
</p>
<p>
Although it surprises some developers, many X applications will run
perfectly well without a window manager. Old stalwarts like
<code>xclock</code> and <code>xcalc</code> work just the same with
or
without one -- so long as you don't mind positioning their windows
using the command line. If you're building an appliance with a single
application, whose main window should fill the entire screen, question
whether you need a window manager at all. If you do, you almost
certainly don't need a desktop heavyweight like Gnome Shell. 
You <i>probably</i> don't even need a lightweight
desktop window manager like <code>xfwm</code> or <code>IceWM</code> 
-- even the lightest of the lightweight desktop window managers is
too sophisticated for an embedded system.
</p>
<p>
For embedded systems that need a window manager, I normally use
<code>matchbox</code>. For Raspberry Pi, this is available from
the Raspbian repository, although I doubt that anybody running
Raspbian actually uses it. The key feature of <code>matchbox</code>
-- apart from its speed and size -- 
is that it forces a single, full-screen window. You can switch
between multiple applications if you have them, but each will
occupy the whole screen. This is exactly the behaviour that is required
when using a 5" or 7" touch panel as your display device.
</p>
<p>
The window manager is usually started very soon after the X server 
starts, and has a lifetime the same as that of the X server. In an embedded
system the window manager may be largely invisible to users.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
A key part of an X installation on a desktop system is a 
<code>display manager</code>. The display manager is a small X client
application that authenticates users, and creates a new desktop
session when a user logs in. There's almost certainly no need
for such a thing in an embedded system -- you would just
arrange for a startup script to run the required application
with the appropriate user permissions.
</p>



<p>
In short, to run an X application on an embedded Linux system you
need an X server, whatever X-related libraries your application
requires, and perhaps a window manager. And that's probably about
all.
</p>

<h2>Obtaining the X server</h2>

<p>
The standard <code>Xorg</code> server for the Raspberry Pi is
available in the Raspbian repository, in the <code>xorg</code>
package. The full package contains a lot of code that you'll never
need, but the alternative is to build the server from source, which
will give you better control. This isn't a job for the faint-hearted,
however. 
</p>
<p>
The driver for the Linux framebuffer is included in the <code>xorg</code>
package, but
you'll probably need additional kernel modules for input devices.
In particular, the <code>evdev</code> module (in package
<code>xserver-xorg-input-evdev</code> will enable input from
many standard input devices, including almost all USB devices,
and the Raspberry Pi official 7" touchscreen (I'm unsure if
3rd-party touch panels are supported using the same interface).
</p>

<h2>Configuring the X server</h2>

<p>
This is where we have to take a step back in time, because in a
system without desktop infrastructure the configuration will have
to be defined manually. The display configuration is probably
straightforward enough, if you have only one display device. On the
Raspberry Pi the only supported display interface is the 
Linux framebuffer, whether you're using a touch panel or an
external HDMI monitor, so this configuration will be boilerplate.
For input devices, however, you might have to experiment. 
</p>
<p>
If you're using the <code>evdev</code> module, then most (perhaps all)
input devices will be aggregated as device files 
under <code>/dev/input</code>. Lacking something like <code>udev</code>
to categorize these devices and give them helpful names, you'll have
to figure out which <code>eventXXX</code> file corresponds to which
device. Although there are utilities for probing the <code>/dev/input</code>
devices, I don't really think there's a better method than
<code>cat /dev/input/eventXXX</code> while wiggling the various 
input devices, to see which shows activity.
</p>
<p>
I've found that the assignment of <code>eventXXX</code> devices to
hardware is stable between reboots -- but it will probably change
if hardware devices are added or removed.
</p>
<p>
The following is a sample configuration for a Pi 3B that has
a USB keypad, a USB trackball (mouse), and a touch panel. You
probably shouldn't assume that the input device numbers will
be transferrable to any other system.
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">

EndSection
</pre>
<p>
The options in the <code>ServerFlags</code> section are essentially
to disable auto-configuration, which won't work without
<code>udev</code> and DBus. The <code>serverLayout</code> section
has one entry for each hardware device -- one display and three
input devices. The <code>InputDevice</code> sections simply
associate a name with a file in <code>/dev/input</code>. 
</p>
<p>
This is a fairly simple X configuration, compared with the
kind we had to create in the 90s. At least we don't have to
configure the display hardware timing parameters for different
display modes -- that is all handled in the kernel's
framebuffer device.
</p>

<h2>Starting X</h2>

<p>
The following script, which is run from an <code>init</code> script,
is sufficient to start the X server, the <code>matchbox</code> window
manager, and my Internet radio application. Starting the X server and window
manager takes about a half-second on a Pi 3B -- starting a 
Gnome desktop session takes sixty times that long.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">mkdir /var/log
modprobe evdev
Xorg -config /etc/X<font color="#993399">11</font>/X<font color="#990000">.</font>conf
su - user -c <font color="#FF0000">"DISPLAY=:0 matchbox-window-manager &amp;"</font>
su - user -c <font color="#FF0000">"DISPLAY=:0 gxsradio &amp;"</font>
</pre>

<p>
The <code>mkdir /var/log</code> command is necessary if 
<code>/var</code> is an in-memory filesystem -- which it will
have to be if you're running a read-only root filesystem. It's
good security discipline to run application code as an unprivileged
user so far as possible, hence the <code>su</code> invocations.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
Running X on an embedded Linux system might not be the most 
obvious way to get a graphical user interface but, in fact,
there are few alternatives that don't involve massive amounts
of work. With careful configuration, running X need not be slow
or unreasonably memory-intensive, even on a single-board computer.
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
Building a complete, functional Linux distribution for an embedded
or appliance application is not straightforward, as you'll have 
seen if you've followed the articles in this series. An awful lot
of Linux software -- even low-level system software -- assumes a
large-scale installation, for a desktop or server. There are many,
many embedded Linux appliances in the world, but pre-packaged,
supported distributions for such applications are -- well, 
non-existent.
</p>
<p>
Happily, building your own is interesting and educational, which is a
good thing, considering how much work is involved.
