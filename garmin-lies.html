<h1>Is your fitness watch lying to you?</h1>

<img class="article-top-image" src="img/snakeoil.png"

<p>
The use of smart watches for tracking health and fitness metrics has 
recently become popular. The vendors of these devices caution against using
their readings for making any kind of health decision but, at the same 
time, they present the data in an analytical, clinical way. The data
certainly looks like it can be trusted for medical purposes.
</p>

<p>
But can it? Or is this just another dose of snake oil? 
</p>

<p>
On the whole I've found -- as others have -- that fitness watches can 
track heart rate reasonably well. Certainly these devices have gotten
better at this over the last few years. I feel reasonably confident 
that I can trust this metric. However, my watch presents data on 'stress', 
respiration
rate, sleep quality, and a bunch of other things. 
Can any of this information be trusted? 
</p>

<p>
All these metrics have to be derived from heart-beat information, coupled
with movement and position sensors. Most smart watches have no other
relevant sensors. It's <i>plausible</i> that respiration rate can be
derived from heart-beat, because the intervals between beats vary
during the respiration cycle. But 'plausible' isn't the same as 
'practicable'. It's actually really hard to gather accurate 
beat-to-beat heart
timings from a wrist-worn device, so it shouldn't be a surprise if
the derived metrics are not particularly accurate. 
</p>

<p>
I decided to test how accurately my Garmin Venu 2 and Garmin Vivoactive 3
could track respiration rate. I haven't tested any other devices, but
they all calculate this metric the same way.
</p>

<p>
The reason I tested respiration rate is that this is an entirely 
objective measure. 'Stress' and 'sleep quality' are not well defined, and
it isn't clear even how to express them. But to measure respiration rate
in a completely objective way, all you need is a timer of some kind. So
the accuracy of this metric is easy to assess, and anybody can do it
in ten minutes or so.
</p>

<p>
I therefore carried out a series of experiments, breathing at
different rates (assessed by an external timer). The graph below shows
my respiration rate during one series of experiments, as reported by the 
Venu 2 via the Garmin Connect web service. Results from the Vivoactive
were broadly similar. 
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/garmin-lies.png" alg="graph or respiration rate"/>
</p>

<p>
The first test was to set the watch to its 'breathwork' mode, with 
a breathing cycle of 4 breaths per minute. In this mode, the 
watch presents a timer, and the user is supposed to breath in and
out to that timer. Point 'A' on the
graph shows that the watch correctly reports this respiration rate.
</p>

<p>
A little later, I made no change to the watch settings, but just 
reduced my breathing rate to 4 per minute, using an external timer.
The watch was unaware that I was doing anything out of the ordinary.
I continued this test, and the others I describe here, 
for at least five minutes, to
allow for the effect of averaging. Note at point 'B' the watch 
records my
respiration rate during this experiment as about 12 per minute 
-- much higher than the true value of 4 per minute.
</p>

<p>
Then I tried setting the watch to 'breathwork' mode again, with a breathing
cycle of 4 breaths per minute, but actually 
breathing at 12 breaths per minute,
using an external timer. At point 'C' you can see that the watch
records 4 breaths per minute, even though my real respiration rate
is much higher.
</p>

<p>
It's clear that the watch can't track my respiration rate even 
approximately. To be fair, that's not entirely unexpected -- this
kind of respiration tracking is difficult. I repeated these tests
at different times of day, and on different days.
It turned out that it's not just extremes of respiration rate 
that the watch can't track.
I tried adjusting my breathing rate gradually over a range from
4 to 20 breaths per minute. At no point did the watch display anything
other than 12-14 breaths per minute.
</p>

<p>
That my respiration rate was reported inaccurately is not what 
blew my mind: what took my
breath (hah!) away was that the watch actually lied to my face.
It recorded a respiration rate that matched the timing of its
own breathing exercises, even when the real respiration rate was
not remotely similar. <b>The watch is not merely inaccurate -- it tells outright, bare-faced, in-its-teeth <i>lies</i></b>.
</p>

<p>
To be absolutely fair, I have to point out that the watch isn't
always completely inaccurate -- the respiration rate is not just a 
random number. The average rates recorded over <i>hours</i> are
broadly correct -- I've checked them against medical-grade
respiration monitoring devices (yes, I really am that pedantic).
I'm not going into those tests in more detail, because most people
won't have the equipment to repeat them. But I imagine that everybody
has access to a timer of some kind (including the one on your wrist).
</p>

<p>
I have to stress that the poor accuracy isn't really the pressing
issue here:
the frightening thing is that the watch deliberately lies, presenting
data that it assumes should be correct, without actually testing
anything.
</p>

<p>
What does this say about the other health metrics that a smart watch
might report? I think it says that, not only might they be inaccurate, 
but that the device can plausibly be assumed to invent results and
present them as authoritative.
</p>

<p>
I've only tested Garmin devices, and only two of those. And, of course,
I've only tested myself as the operator. It's entirely possible that
other people will find these watches more accurate, for a whole heap
of different reasons. What isn't dependent on the user is that the
watch presents metrics that it <i>assumes</i> rather
than measures. I presume that this could also happen in the reporting
of 'stress' and other, more subjective measures. Unfortunately, it's
not as easy to test whether those results are reliable, because they
poorly defined to start with.
</p>

<p>
However, I'm fairly sure that the 'stress' metric is also full of lies. If I
sleep during the time I've told the watch is my regular sleep time,
the 'stress' display generally shows 'rest'. If I sleep at times outside
this period, the 'stress' measure does not change very much from
its usual day-time reading. I'm fairly sure that the watch is 
muting the stress readings when it assumes I'm asleep.
</p>

<p>
So where does this leave us?
I've reported my observations on this subject to Garmin several times
over the last few years. The best response I've had is that
they're 'working on it'. As I said, measuring respiration rate
from heart beat variability is difficult. What worries me is that
the Garmin watch is inventing data, and presenting it as measurement.
</p>

<p>
But there's no need to take my word for any of this: if you have a
fitness watch that reports respiration rate, its accuracy is actually
easy to test for yourself. If the watch is inaccurate in this measure,
it's probably safe to assume that it's inaccurate elsewhere also.
