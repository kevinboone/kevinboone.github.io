<h1>They don't make 'em like that any more: The Philips Pronto remote control</h1>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Many consumer electronic appliances have remote controls. A common
feature of most UK households -- probably most households anywhere
on Earth -- is a basket full of remote controls. My AV/hi-fi system
has about a dozen components, each with its own remote control. 
I don't think this is particularly unusual. 
</p>
<p>
In the 1990s, a number of manufacturers started producing 'universal' remotes,
that could control multiple devices. Usually these devices were selected
from a (short) list of popular appliances. To be fair, the market for
home entertainment devices wasn't as expansive in the 90s as it is
now; but if you owned a device that was unsupported, you could fall back
on a 'learning' remote, that you could program from the device vendor's own
remote.
</p>
<p>
And so things remained, until home entertainment systems became
<i>really</i> complicated. Most 'universal' remotes could only 
control three or four devices, and there was no way to control
multiple devices using a single button-press.  
</p>
<p>
Then, in 1998, the Pronto came along, and changed everything. 
</p>
<p>
The Pronto wasn't just a 'learning' remote -- it was a fully programmable,
customizable remote. It could support any (realistic) number of 
devices and, best of all, it could control more than one at the same
time. What this meant is that, on the home screen, I could press
the 'XBox' button, and it would turn on the XBox and my video projector,
then turn on the AV amplifier and set it to the configuration I liked for
video games. I could even program it to control things I had built 
myself, like my home-made Raspberry Pi-based media player. Some people
even set theirs up to control home lighting and heating. 
</p>
<p>
The Pronto wasn't just better by miles than anything available at the
time -- it was better than anything that is available today. That
wasn't just because of its sophistication.
</p>
<p>
- The Pronto had a large, touch-sensitive screen, and you could lay out
the controls and menus however you liked. There was no more guessing
what the button with the red dot did, when controlling a particular
appliance -- the button on screen said "Subwoofer volume up", or whatever.
</p>
<p>
- The Pronto had a charging dock, and it was part of the standard
product, not an add-on. But it could also be powered by standard, replaceable
AA batteries. So you'd never find it unusable. 
</p>
<p>
- It had an enormous IR emitter, that could reach appliances even in
different rooms. No single room was too large for it.
</p>
<p>
- In its heyday, the Pronto had a large, vigorous community
around it. Although you could program the Pronto any way you wanted,
in practice you didn't have to, unless you were controlling something
home-made: somebody would have already done it, and released a 
suitable configuration file. 
</p>
<p>
The Pronto was an enthusiast's device, to be sure. But if you have a 
home A/V set-up with a dozen separate appliances, you had to be an
enthusiast. The Pronto was set supplied with a comprehensive
configuration tool (alas, for Windows only), which was well-documented
and relatively easy to use. Not only could you assign any kind of 
action to any screen button, you could draw your own buttons, and assign
graphic images to them. So if you wanted to select a particular TV
channel, for example, you could assign the channel's logo to a button.
</p>
<p>
The original Prontos had monochrome screens and were fairly chunky
units. Later models had full colour screens, and were were of roughly
smartphone size. To make the unit itself more compact, some models
had smaller screens, but to my mind that detracted from the main
purpose of the device: you could have all the common controls on one
screen.
</p>
<p>
Although the Pronto notionally only supported Windows for programming, there
was enough of an enthusiast following for third-party programmers to
be developed. I used a Java program called 'Tonto' for this. It still
works, but I see that it hasn't been updated for about ten years. Since
that Pronto went out of production in 2010, that's hardly surprising.
</p>
<p>
So what happened to the Pronto? There was no significant competition,
so I can only imagine it was market stagnation. Eventually, everybody
who wanted a fully-programmable touch-screen remote had one. Since
the same remote could control almost anything, the introduction of
new devices into the market did not increase sales. Probably a few
people upgraded to the later Prontos that had colour screens, but I
was perfectly happy with my monochrome unit. Since they lasted 
forever (mine is still working fine) nobody needed to replace one.
</p>
<p>
I suspect that, over time, simpler universal controllers like the
Logitech Harmony range took away some of the Pronto's market. 
The Harmony never was a serious competitor for the Pronto, but it could
do some of what the Pronto did, and was easier to set up. The set-up
process was Web-based, but still required software to be installed
locally. The Harmony shared with the Pronto the ability to control
multiple devices with a single button-press, but it was nowhere near
as flexible.   
</p>
<p>
I was rather hoping I could fall back on the Harmony when my Pronto
finally gave up the ghost -- but it turns out that Harmony is dead
as well. This is a bigger problem than the demise of the Pronto, because
there's no way (so far as I know) to program the Harmony except
using Logitech's web-based system. So once that finally closes down,
all Harmony devices will be frozen in their current configuration. 
</p>
<p>
It's interesting to speculate on why the Harmony range was abandoned, and
whether the reasons are the same as for the Pronto. To some extent 
I suspect that market stagnation is a factor for both products. Since both
products are long-lived, and can accommodate new devices, expanding
the market means waiting for new consumers to be born. The usual way
that vendors deal with market stagnation is to introduce new 
products that are better, faster, shinier, more attractive, etc. After all,
Lenovo and Dell have no problem shifting laptop computers, even though
everybody has one already.
</p>
<p>
But the Pronto and the Harmony are both victims of their own success --
they can't easily be improved, given what they do. Both are perfectly
suited for their current application. The only reason to buy a new
one is because the old one has failed, and both products could 
outlive their owners. It costs the manufacturers money to maintain
production facilities, and sales of new units probably won't balance
those costs.
</p>
<p>
The moral of this story, I guess, is this: if you buy something that
you really like, that works well, and is built to last <i>look after it</i>.
You probably won't be able to replace it.
