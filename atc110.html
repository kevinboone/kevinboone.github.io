don’t make ’em like that any more: Honda’s ATC110 all-terrain cycle</h1>
<p><img src="img/atc110_icon.jpg" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>In the early 1980s there was a brief craze, mostly in the USA, for
three-wheeled all-terrain motor vehicles. So far as I know, the Honda
ATC range represented the only such machines to enter the UK in any
quantity, and even these were hardly commonplace. Perhaps that’s no bad
thing: they were unwieldy, impractical, and unstable. At the time,
however, there wasn’t really an alternative, if you wanted a low-cost
off-road vehicle.</p>
<p>There still isn’t.</p>
<p>The ATC range consisted of nominal 70cc, 90cc, and 110cc models.
Honda did go on to produce a 250cc version but, although it was still
three-wheeled, it was more like a conventional motorcycle in its
construction. The ATC110 was the pinnacle of the range, with enough
power and ruggedness to carry an adult rider at reasonable speed, and
even to tow a trailer. The smaller models seem to have been aimed at
children, but I’m not sure any responsible parent would buy a child
something this lethal.</p>
<p>The ATC110 was a strikingly simple machine. It had a manual
pull-starter like a chainsaw, a pedal-operated four-speed gearbox and
chain drive like a motorcycle, and colossal balloon tyres like, well, I
don’t even know. A moon buggy, perhaps? The single-cylinder engine was
air-cooled, and the electrical system just a few wires.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it had a semi-automatic clutch, so changing gears was
easy. This was important for marketing purposes, because you didn’t have
to be a trained motorcyclist to ride the ATC. In fact, motorcycle
experience was a disadvantage, because this thing was <em>nothing</em>
like a motorcycle to drive.</p>
<p>The ATC had a solid rear axle, that is, it lacked a differential
drive. A solid axle is an advantage in really lose terrain like soft
mud, because a differential drive tends to apply power to whichever
wheel turns more easily. In mud, this is usually the wheel that’s in the
mire. I’m sure we’ve all had the experience of being stuck in a car on
poor ground, one wheel spinning uselessly in a rut, while another wheel
on firm ground just sits there, laughing at us. The solid rear axle
ensured equal power distribution between the rear wheels, regardless of
the terrain.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be hard to see the problem, though. In anything other
than soft mud or sand, we <em>need</em> a differential drive for
steering. If both rear wheels have grip, and are powered together at the
same speed, the vehicle will always want to travel in a straight
line.</p>
<p>Consequently, it was nightmarish to steer in anything other than sand
or soft mud. The only way to drive it on a road – and this wouldn’t have
been legal in the UK – was to lean so far over that one rear wheel came
completely off the ground. The first time I drove an ATC, it was
straight into a neighbour’s car. The ATC cruelly mocked my attempts to
steer with the handlebars.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the huge balloon tyre at the front came to my rescue by
absorbing the impact, and I was spared an insurance claim and, perhaps,
jail time.</p>
<p>Those balloon tyres weren’t just there to protect me from my
negligence: they were an alternative to suspension, which the ATC
notably lacked. As a means of absorbing shocks they were pretty
effective, but suspension is part of the steering mechanism in any
practical vehicle.</p>
<p><img src="img/atc110.jpg" class="article-centre-image" /></p>
<p>The best thing about the ATC110 was its price: about £500 new. In
today’s money that’s about £1,500. It was difficult to get any kind of
motor vehicle for that price, particularly from Honda. The ATC was cheap
to run, too, as you’d expect of a light-weight, 110cc motorcycle.
Routine servicing was easy, and needed no special tools. The fact that
many are still running, forty years later, is a testament to the ATC’s
reliability.</p>
<p>For all that, the ATC range wasn’t a success in the UK. Unlike in the
USA, it wasn’t the terrible safety record that sunk the ATC. The real
problem was that there weren’t many places you could legally ride one.
Since they weren’t road-legal (thankfully) you’d have to take it on a
trailer to any place where you could ride it, and there were few of
those. Even specialist off-road driving tracks – or, more likely, their
insurers – didn’t welcome them.</p>
<p>I bought my ATC for forestry work, but even there it wasn’t very
practical. Unless the ground was very wet, the solid rear axle made it
difficult to steer between the trees. I could tow a trailer full of
timber with it: the machine had more than enough traction. But, with its
comparatively light weight, putting any load on the trailer hitch would
cause the front of the ATC to lift, rendering its front-wheel steering
even more useless than it ordinarily was. The balloon tyres were
alarmingly prone to punctures, and pull-starting the ATC on a cold
winter’s morning was demanding enough to stop me feeling cold for
long.</p>
<p>While routine servicing was cheap and straightforward, getting spare
parts in the UK was neither, particularly as the ATCs became less
popular. That pull-starter was particularly troublesome. It had a coiled
spring wrapped around a toothed wheel, which engaged with some pegs when
pulling the starter cord. The toothed wheel and the pegs wore out quite
quickly, needing frequent replacement from (as I recall) the USA. The
big, padded seat also tore easily, and I rarely saw one that wasn’t made
primarily of duct tape. The plastic mudguards cracked under the
slightest impact or, sometimes, spontaneously – another job for the duct
tape.</p>
<p>In the end, I gave it up and bought a quad-bike instead. I rather
regret that now, as ATCs in running order now sell for at least £2,000 –
significantly more than they cost when new. Motor vehicles that
‘appreciate’, rather depreciate, in price are very unusual.</p>
<p>It’s a shame that we can no longer buy an all-terrain vehicle,
however many wheels it has, for the same kind of price as an ATC. Today,
Honda’s entry-level quad-bikes have prices starting at about £10,000. Of
course, these are more sophisticated vehicles than the ATC, with
four-wheel drive, computerized engine management, and all the modern
gimmicks. Maintaining and servicing them requires specialist facilities,
while the ATC was simple enough even for a dunce like me to work on.</p>
<p>I suppose the gap in the market has been filled, to some extent, by
Chinese motor companies like CF Moto. Their quad-bikes have the same
crude charm as the ATC – simple engines, chain drive, solid rear axles –
but even these cost at least £4,000. I guess low cost and simplicity are
no longer selling points in the automotive world, and that’s a
shame.</p>
