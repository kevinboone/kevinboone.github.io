<h1>Command-line hacking: extracting audio metadata (tags)</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/terminal.png" 
  alt="display"/>
This is another in my series of 
articles on doing off-beat and (I hope) interesting things
with standard Linux command-line tools. 
</p>
<p>
This is a relatively simple application compared to some I've presented.
In this article I'll demonstrate
how to extract metadata (tags) in a reasonably consistent way, from
a variety of different audio file formats. 
</p>

<p>
Why would this be useful? Will, when I rip audio CDs to disk, or buy DRM-free
albums from commercial suppliers, they end up in a directory, in no
particular format. I usually use a tag editor like EasyTag 
or <code>Kid3</code> to add metadata according to my own filing 
conventions. What I'd like to then, is to move all the individual files
to directories based on (for example) the album name. Perhaps
I might organize my music into album folders like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
/home/kevin/music/Bach - Goldberg Variations
/home/kevin/music/Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon
...
</pre>

<p>
For such a scheme I just need the tag that represents the 
album name and, perhaps, the tag that represents the track
title. If I want to
be a bit more systematic, I might organize by artist and album name:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
/home/kevin/music/Glenn Gould/Bach - Goldberg Variations
/home/kevin/music/Pink Floyd/Dark Side of the Moon
...
</pre>

<p>
Or, perhaps, by composer and artist; or genre and composer; or
whatever structure suits me. If I want to do this automatically using
a script,
operating on a bunch of miscellaneous files, a pre-requisite is to 
be able to get all the necessary metadata from audio files. 
</p>

<p>
There are a number of utilities that can do this, but using them
in a script is more
complicated than it might seem at first. First, different audio
formats use completely different tagging strategies. ID3 tags
(usually used in MP3) use a bunch of four-letter abbreviations
for the tag names. For example, album is usually <code>TALB</code>.
FLAC/Vorbis tags use more descriptive names, like "ALBUM".
</p>

<p>
Second, utilities that can extract this information are often a 
bit sloppy about the output layout. After all, it usually isn't designed
to be readable from a script.
</p>

<p>
Third, in file formats that allow flexible tag names, there's no 
common agreement on things like letter case or punctuation
("ALBUM" vs. "album"; "album_artist" vs. "album-artist")
</p>

<p>
Another subtlety -- one which experienced shell programmers will usually
deal with instinctively -- is that we'll almost certainly be dealing
with filenames that contain spaces. This requires a bit of care in
scripting.
</p>

<p>
In practice, I usually use 
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/gettags">gettags -- a utility I wrote myself</a> because it produces output in exactly the format I want. However,
for the purposes of this article, that would be cheating -- I want to 
use widely-available utilities that are typically found in the usual
Linux repositories.
</p>

<p>
The best standard utility I've found for this purpose is <code>ffprobe</code>,
which is part of the FFMpeg utility. If it isn't installed by 
default, you can probably do <code>dnf install ffmpeg</code> or <code>apt-get install ffmpeg</code>, or whatever is appropriate to your distribution.
<code>ffprobe</code> handles most common audio formats, including the
high-resolution DSF format. However, it's output can be a little
hard to parse, and differs slightly according to the file type.
</p>

<p>
To get information about an audio file, use <code>ffprobe -i {filename}</code>.
Here is a typical output:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
...
Input #0, flac, from 'mediafiles/audio_music/Pink Floyd - 
The Dark Side Of The Moon/06 Money.flac':
  Metadata:
    album           : Pink Floyd - The Dark Side Of The Moon
    artist          : Pink Floyd
    title           : Money
    album artist    : Pink Floyd
    genre           : Music - Classic rock and pop
    composer        : Pink Floyd
    date            : 1973
    track           : 06
  Duration: 00:06:36.50, start: 0.000000, bitrate: 3018 kb/s
    Stream #0:0: Audio: flac, 4100 Hz, stereo, s16 (16 bit) 
  Metadata:
    comment         : Cover
    title           : cover
</pre>

<p>
If we want to process this output using <code>grep</code>, <code>awk</code>,
etc., there are a few things to watch out for -- one of which is not
at all obvious. This non-obvious complication 
is that <code>ffprobe</code> 
produces output to <code>stderr</code>, not <code>stdout</code>. This means
that special care needs to be taken when using pipes and redirection.
To pipe the output of <code>ffprobe</code> into <code>grep</code>, 
for example, we need:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
ffprobe -i "$filename" 2>&1 | grep ...
</pre>

<p>
In this example, I've assumed that we've already got the audio filename
into the environment variable <code>$filename</code>. The double-quotes
are needed to ensure that spaces in the filename don't lead to its
being split into multiple 
arguments.
The formulation <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code> tells Bash to redirect stream
2 (<code>stderr</code>) to stream 1 (<code>stdout</code>).
An alternative to using pipes would be to redirect the output of
<code>ffprobe</code> to a file using the <code>2&gt;</code> syntax,
and then process the file.
</p>
<p>
The next problem is that naive use of <code>grep</code> to select lines
is likely to collect too much data. For example, 
<code>grep -i title</code> will match not only the title tag, but the
title of the cover image. <code>grep -i album</code> will match the
album tag, but it will also match "album artist". Without complex
parsing, I don't see any simple way to deal with the first
issue, that the same tag name appears several times. In practice,
however, I've found that the first "title" in the <code>ffprobe</code>
output is always the one I actually want, so we can just limit
<code>grep</code> to one match:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
ffprobe -i "$filename" 2>&1 | grep --max-count=1 ... 
</pre>

<p>
The second complication, where the same string of text might appear in
multiple tags, can be handled using a properly-crafted match expression.
For example, to match "album : xxxx", but not "album artist : xxx"
we can check that the colon character is in the right place. So
this should match (only) the album tag:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
ffprobe -i "$filename" 2>&1 | grep --max-count=1 -i album\\s*:
</pre>

<p>
The <code>-i</code> makes the match case-insensitive, which is needed
in general. <code>\\s*:</code> matches some whitespace followed by
one colon. 
</p>
<p>
The output of this command will be:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
    album           : Pink Floyd - The Dark Side Of The Moon
</pre>

<p>
There are many possible ways to separate the actual tag text from
the tag name. Here is a simple method using <code>cut</code>:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
ffprobe -i "$filename" 2>&1 | grep --max-count=1 -i album\\s*: \
  | cut -f 2 -d :
</pre>

<p>
The output is:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
 Pink Floyd - The Dark Side Of The Moon
</pre>

<p>
This text begins with a space, because <code>cut</code> does not
trim spaces from its output. To do that, we can use <code>sed</code>
(among many other things).
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
ffprobe -i "$filename" 2>&1 | grep --max-count=1 -i album\\s*: \
  | cut -f 2 -d : | sed 's/^ *//;s/ *$//' 
</pre>

<p>
This <code>sed</code> invocation has two search-and-replace expressions
-- one for the whitespace at the beginning of the line, and one for
the end.
</p>
<p>
This simple(ish) command will do the right thing for the "album" tag --
it will produce the album name, stripped of whitespace, to <code>stdout</code>,
ready to be used in another command or script.
</p>
<p>
To get the title, genre, and composer metadata is simply a matter of
substituting the appropriate text for "album" in the command. 
Artist/performer is a lot more complicated, because there's far
less standardization in this area. In practice, you'll need to 
search for a number of different tags -- <code>artist</code>,
<code>album artist</code>, <code>album_artist</code>, <code>performer</code>
(at least), and make a decision which to include. 
To some extent that decision will have to be guided by the player
software you use. My Astell &amp; Kern player gets very confused if
different files in the same directory have different "album artist"
tags, so I generally use this tag (allowing for the variations
between formats) as the general "artist" name. The scriping
here isn't very interesting -- it's just a bunch of
<code>IF...THEN</code> clauses. Implementing this is left as
an exercise for the reader.
