<h1>They don't make 'em like that any more: how the Vectrex almost revolutionized video gaming</h1>
<p>

The Vectrex was a revolutionary video gaming console, which enjoyed a brief
frenzy of popularity from about 1980 until 1983. When I first played
one, I was staggered by the image quality provided by its built-in screen --
at least the equal of the full-sized cabinet games we played
in amusement arcades, and dramatically better than any competing 
consumer gaming console.  
</p>
<p>
The Vectrex display  wasn't just
faster or more colourful than other gaming systems: it worked in 
completely new way. New in the entertainment industry, anyway: the
Vectrex display was more like a laboratory oscilloscope than a television.  
</p>
<p>
Uniquely among home video consoles, the Vectrex had a built-in screen.
All previous consoles had to be connected to a video monitor or,
more usually, a television set. Typically, the console included a 
UHF modulator, so it could be plugged into the television's 
aerial socket. We would then tune the television to the modulator's
output frequency, in the same way we would tune to a TV station:
typically by turning a knob on the front of the set. More advanced
TV sets (advanced for 1980, that is) had programmable buttons for 
different channels, one of which could be set to the console's output
frequency. Very advanced TV sets included a composite video input as
well as an antenna socket. If present, this offered a better-quality
picture than the antenna socket, but still crude by modern standards.
</p>

<p>
The Vectrex didn't have a built-in screen just for convenience: most
households had a television set, but few had an oscilloscope.
The Vectrex could never have been made to work with a 
conventional video monitor -- not in 1980, anyway. 
</p>

<p>
A conventional television set used a raster-based display: the entire 
screen was redrawn 50-60 times per second by a scanning electron
beam. Because the display was made up of a fixed number of lines
(525 viewable lines in the UK), it was inherently pixellated, although we did
not really think in terms of 'pixels' at that time.  525 vertical pixels
is a respectable resolution on a screen of modest size but, in practice,
electronic technology of the time was not able to provide that resolution.
A conventional UK TV set offered a resolution of about 300x600 pixels. 
</p

<p>
This comparatively poor resolution meant that straight lines looked 
fuzzy, and text could not be smaller than about one tenth the screen
height. Using a TV modulator rather than a composite video connection
-- which few TV sets had -- made the situation even worse, as the
modulation and demodulation process was inherently noisy. 
</p>

<p>
The Vectrex avoided all these problems by not using a raster scan at all.
Instead, its display directed an electron beam along the exact lines to
be drawn. It used a pair of digital-to-analogue converters to create voltages
to deflect the beam in the horizontal and vertical axes, and thus build
up any shape required, line by line. 
The 'resolution' of this display was the width of the electron
beam on the screen surface, perhaps a half millimetre or so. But
straight lines looked straight, not fuzzy -- there was just a bit of
a glow around the drawn lines, which I thought looked rather appealing.
</p>

</p>

</p>

<p>
The display technology of the Vectrex lent itself well to line
drawing. Because it did not have to maintain a complete raster, the
Vectrex used far less computation to build the display than contemporaneous
consoles. It had an 8-bit CPU running at 1.5 MHz, with only a few kB of
RAM -- a similar specification to the Sinclair ZX80. Because maintaining
the display was so simple, the Vectrex had more CPU resource left over
for other things. Although it used the same sound generator as most
consoles (and early desktop computers) -- the General Instruments AY-3-8910
-- some games were able to use synthesized speech as well as the usual
beeps and bangs. This is all the more remarkable when we remember that
the game cartridges never had more than 32kB of storage. 
</p>

<p>
Moreover, rather than providing only a top-down or side-scrolling
view, as was common in all other games consoles, the Vectrex could
display a measure of perspective. We can just about see this in the
screenshot of the <i>Spike</i> game above. Spike not only moves
side-to-side, but also forwards and backwards, as rendered by the
perspective view. Forty years on, it's not obvious how difficult
it would have been to produce such a display on a console game.
</p>

<p>
The Vectrex could also produce a 3D effect -- using proprietary
goggles -- at least ten years before this technology entered the consumer
market. 
</p>

<p>
My recollection is that about 20 games were available in the UK, including
the built-in 'Minefield'. I owned most of these at some point. Not all
were of the same quality as <i>Spike</i>, but all were somewhat engaging.
</p>

<p>
So what happened to the Vectrex? Its most obvious limitation was that it
had only a monochrome display, at a time when most households had access
to a colour TV. TV-based consoles made very limited use of colour in the
early 80s, but it was clear that colour was going to be important. Some
Vectrex games came with colour overlays that we could physically place in
front of the display. These worked -- to some extent -- for games where
specific screen regions were of fixed size: an area of sea and an area
for sky, for example. But this crude use of colour added nothing to the
gameplay.
</p>

<p>
More subtly, the Vectrex was only suitable for games that could be 
rendered using its proprietary line drawing technology. It's plausible
that this limitation could lead eventually to the repertoire of possible
games being completely exhausted but, in fact, the Vectrex died long 
before we reached that point. 
</p>

<p>
What killed the Vectrex was the same thing that killed most games consoles
in the early 80s: the rise of the desktop computer. A desktop computer
could play games <i>and</i> do many other things. Some of the early
consumer computers were marketed with a focus on gaming; a good example
was Commodore's <i>VIC-20</i>, which had a cartridge slot for software, 
making it as easy to use as a games console; but it could also be used
for math and word processing. Games consoles were --
and largely still are -- single-minded appliances. 
</p>

<p>
Dedicated games consoles didn't really regain a market until the technology
became so cheap that an ordinary household could contemplate owning
both a desktop computer <i>and</i> a games console. The renewed interest
in games consoles was helped by the diversification
of computer hardware in the 80s. It became difficult for game developers
to produce software that worked on general-purpose computers -- even when 
they mostly ran the same operating system. The MS-DOS computers of the
80s had different CPU speeds, memory, sound capabilities, and video
resolutions. In the end it became easier for developers to target 
proprietary games consoles again, which made them more popular. But,
by the time this happened, the Vectrex had already gone out of production. 
</p>

<p>
And let's not forget that the Vectrex wasn't cheap: at about £200 in
1982, it was a comparable price to a serviceable second-hand car. My
first car, in 1985, cost £86. To be sure,
the Vectrex didn't need a separate display, which could have been a cost
saving -- but most households already had a 
TV set. We were used to paying comparatively large sums for electronic
devices back in those days: a decent colour TV would also have cost
as much as a second-hand car. In fact, in the 70s my parents rented their 
TV set on a monthly basis, as many people did. Given how expensive
the Vectrex was in 1980's money, it surprises me how many people actually
did own one. Although the game cartridges were expensive, there was a 
large enough owner base to swap or borrow them. 
Somewhere, a woman called Alison probably still has a bag-full
of Vectrex cartridges that she never returned when she dumped me.  
</p>

<p>
The Vectrex is an example of a technology that ought to have done
better than it did. Of course, market forces rule the gaming industry,
as they do all aspects of consumer electronics, and market forces aren't
always logical. In an alternative 
universe, we are all playing line-based video games on ten-foot screens
at two thousand frames per second but, of course, that isn't how
things worked out. 
</p>

<p>
There remains a small, but robust, enthusiast interest in the Vectrex,
as there is for CP/M and the Apple IIe. There are even people producing
new games for it: a challenge of such monumental technological complexity that
I suspect almost no contemporary programmer would be equal to it.
My Vectrex is still in my mother's attic, awaiting capacitor surgery --
perhaps one day I'll get around to it. Maybe.
