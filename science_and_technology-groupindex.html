One of the reasons for this is that the impact on energy efficiency is hard to assess.

However, it's sometimes difficult, or unhelpful, to draw diagrams to scale. This article tries to explain the difference between benign and pernicious distortions of scale. I'm picking on the flat-earthers for the purposes of illustration, but the presentational devices they use are common in business and politics as well.</p><p style="font-size: smaller">Categories: <a href="science_and_technology-groupindex.html">science and technology</a>, <a href="education-groupindex.html">education</a>, <a href="snake_oil-groupindex.html">snake oil</a></p>

I will also make the suggestion that the increased interest in homeopathy, and in other forms of alternative medicine, is a reaction to a dissatisfaction with modern medical practice, rather than a conviction that homeopathy is actually efficacious.</p><p style="font-size: smaller">Categories: <a href="science_and_technology-groupindex.html">science and technology</a>, <a href="snake_oil-groupindex.html">snake oil</a></p>
