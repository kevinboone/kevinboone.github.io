<h1>Making a Raspberry Pi bootable SD card from a root filesystem</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/pi.png" 
  alt="Pi logo"/>
</p>
<p>
I'm quite interested in building custom Linux installations for the
Raspberry Pi, particularly for embedded applications. In this article
I will demonstrate how to turn a root filesystem into a bootable
Raspberry Pi SD card, on a Linux workstation.
Note that I'm not explaining here how to
create the Linux installation as a root filesystem --
I have a whole series of articles on 
<a href="pi_minimal.html">rolling your own custom Linux for the Raspberry Pi</a>. Here I'm assuming that you already have all the Linux software in place, in
some kind of staging directory, and you want to make an image that can be
burned onto an SD card (or distributed to other people who will make 
their own SD cards).
</p>
<p>
When automated, the process of creating a bootable SD image is 
reasonably fast (seconds). However, copying the image to the SD 
card -- particularly if you're using a USB card writer to do it --
can be slow. During the development process, it's often quicker
to work on individual files, rather than creating and writing a new
image for each change you test.
</p>

<h2>Overview of the Pi boot process</h2>

<p>
I'm only going to explain as much here as is needed to understand the
rest of the article. 
</p>
<p>
The Pi boots from the first partition of
an SD card, which must be in FAT (MS-DOS) format. This partition
contains the Pi firmware, which is proprietary, and a set of 
kernels, one for each supported ARM architecture. For true
"bare-metal" programming of the Pi, you can just supply your own
"kernel" implementation as one of the kernel files, and your installation
is complete. For a regular Linux, the kernel files will be full
Linux kernels, compiled with a set of drivers that is sufficient to
continue the boot process.
</p>
<p>
The boot firmware loads and executes the Linux kernel, which by default 
will mount the second partition of the SD card as its root filesystem.
This root partition will initially be mounted read-only, but 
most Linux installations
change this to read-write at some point in the start-up process.
The root partition can have any filesystem that the kernel understands --
<code>ext4</code> is typical. 
</p>
<p>
When the root filesystem is mounted, the kernel will run the
executable <code>/bin/init</code> as process number 1. Everything
that happens after that is coordinated by this init process.
In mainstream Raspbian Linux, "init" is actually the systemd
process launcher. However, <code>/bin/init</code> can be anything --
making it a symbolic link to a shell will give you a workable,
single-user, console-only Linux system.  
</p>
<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>I'm aware that "Raspbian" is now called something else. However, "Raspbian" is the name that appears in much of the documentation, and in the URLs of software repositories, so I will continue to use it.</blockquote>
<p>
I'm assuming that you have a viable <code>/bin/init</code>,
and everything else that goes with it, in a staging directory for the 
root filesystem. 
</p>
<p>
The boot partition will generally be the same for all Pi Linux installations
-- it will contain the boot firmware and kernels. However, there are 
subtle customizations that might need to be applied. The most common
of these is to provide one or both of the files <code>cmdline.txt</code> and
<code>config.txt</code> in the boot partition.
</p>
<p>
<code>cmdline.txt</code> contains the Linux kernel command line. You can
use this to specify certain options, like the location of the root filesystem
if it is not in the second partition. I sometimes use the
<code>quiet</code> option, so the kernel produces less diagnostic logging
on startup (which makes the boot a bit quicker). 
</p>
<p>
<code>config.txt</code> contains a heap of configuration options related
to the Pi firmware. It's probably best to copy this file from a Raspbian
distribution, and edit it to suit your needs. In practice, the Pi
will boot with neither <code>cmdline.txt</code> nor <code>config.txt</code>,
because the defaults are sane. However, many applications do require some
tweaks in one or both these files.
</p>

<h2>Create the staging directories</h2>

<p>
I will store the files for the first disk partition -- the boot
firmware -- in <code>/tmp/boot</code>. The root filesystem, destined
for the second partition, is in </code>/tmp/rootfs</code>. There's 
nothing special about these names or locations.
</p>
<p>
Unless you're compiling your own Linux kernel, your root filesystem
will need to contain the kernel modules that match the running kernel, in
directory <code>/lib/modules</code>. These modules can be found
in the same place as the boot firmware (see below), 
but you'll need
to create the directory <code>/lib/modules</code> to copy them
into. So, in summary, you have:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
/tmp
  boot (empty at present)
  rootfs
    lib
      modules
    -- and the rest of the root filesystem
</pre>


<h2>Get the firmware</h2>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>As is conventional, I show commands that would normally be run as an unprivileged user prefixed with '$', and commands normally run as <code>root</code> prefixed with '#'.</blockquote>

<p>
This step only needs to be carried out once or, at least, only 
rarely. The firmware changes only very infrequently.
To fetch the latest firmware, and install
it in <code>/tmp/boot</code>: 
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">$ cd /tmp
$ curl -o firmware<font color="#990000">.</font>zip <font color="#990000">\</font>
    https<font color="#990000">:</font>//codeload<font color="#990000">.</font>github<font color="#990000">.</font>com/raspberrypi/firmware/zip/refs/heads/master
$ unzip firmware<font color="#990000">.</font>zip   <i><font color="#9A1900"># This creates /tmp/firmware_master</font></i>
$ cp -aux /tmp/firmware_master/boot<font color="#990000">/*</font> /tmp/boot
$ cp /path/to/cmdline<font color="#990000">.</font>txt /tmp/boot <i><font color="#9A1900"># if needed</font></i>
$ cp /path/to/config<font color="#990000">.</font>txt /tmp/boot <i><font color="#9A1900"># if needed</font></i>
</pre>

<p>
Then, to copy the kernel modules into the root filesystem:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ cp -aux /tmp/firmware-master/modules/* /tmp/rootfs/lib/modules
</pre>

<p>
Finally, clean up the downloaded files.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">$ rm -rf firmware_master firmware<font color="#990000">.</font>zip
</pre>

<p>
We should now have the boot firmware in <code>/tmp/boot</code>, and
the root filesystem -- including the kernel modules -- in
<code>/tmp/rootfs</code>.
</p>

<h2>Make the SD card image</h2>

<p>
We'll be creating an image that contains both boot and root partitions
in a single file, ready to copy to an SD card in a single operation.
You'll need first to decide how large the SD image needs to be, and
how it is to be partitioned.
Obviously the partitions need to be large enough to fit the entire contents of
<code>/tmp/boot</code> and <code>/tmp/rootfs</code>. 
I'm assuming that a 2Gb SD card image will
suffice for both partitions, of which I will allocate 256Mb for the boot
partition, and the rest for the root filesystem. 
Of course, this image will fit into a larger SD card if
one is available.
</p>

<p>
The process starts by 
creating an empty file of size 2Gb (or whatever total size you decided on):
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
# dd if=/dev/zero of=pi.img bs=128M count=16
</pre>

<p>
I've named the file <code>pi.img</code>, but there's nothing special
about the name. Make the large file into a loopback block device:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
# losetup -fP pi.img
</pre>

<p>
Assuming that no other loopback devices are in use, the empty 2Gb
file is now the block device <code>/dev/loop0</code>. We need
to partition this device using <code>fdisk</code>, to provide a 256Mb
DOS-format boot partition, and a root partition that uses the rest of the
file. Here's a script to do that.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
# fdisk /dev/loop << EOF
o
n
p
1

+256m
t
c
n
p
2



w
q
EOF

# sync
</pre>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>The blank lines in this script are significant -- they correspond to pressing "enter" to accept default values from <code>fdisk</code>.</blockquote>

<p>
All being well, you should now have two additional block devices:
<code>/dev/loop0p1</code> for the first (boot) partition of the disk
image and <code>/dev/loop0p2</code> for the second (root filesystem)
partition.  
</p>

<p>
Now we need to format these partitions:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
# mkfs.vfat /dev/loop0p1
# mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/loop0p2
</pre>

<p>
Now mount the first partitition (anywhere, but I'm using <code>/tmp/mnt</code>)
and copy the boot files onto it:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
# mount -o loop /dev/loop0p1 /tmp/mnt 
# cp -r /tmp/boot/* /tmp/mnt/ 
# umount /dev/loop0p1
</pre>

<p>
Now mount the root filesystem into the second partition and copy the
files: 
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
# mount -o loop /dev/loop0p2 /tmp/mnt 
# cp -aux ${ROOTFS}/* /tmp/mnt/ 
</pre>

<p>
I normally build my root filesystems as an unprivileged user, which
leaves the files owned by me, not <code>root</code>. It also means that I
can't set the suid and sgid permissions on files that need them
(and many executables typically do). This wasn't a problem for
the boot partition, because that will end up as a FAT partition, which
doesn't support owner or permission flags. It's critical to get these
attributes right on a Linux filesystem, however.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
# chown -R root:root /tmp/mnt/ 
# chmod ug+s /tmp/mnt/usr/bin/sudo
# chmod ug+s /tmp/mnt/bin/ping
# chmod ug+s /tmp/mnt/usr/bin/passwd
# chmod ug+s /tmp/mnt/bin/su
# chmod ug+s /tmp/mnt/bin/login
# ... and maybe others
</pre>

<p>
Finally, clean up -- unmount and disconnect the loopback devices:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
# umount /dev/loop0p2
# losetup -D
</pre>

<p>
At this point, the file <code>pi.img</code> contains a bootable image,
ready to be distributed, or copied to an SD card.
</p>


<h2>Copy the image to an SD card</h2>

<p>
The method I've described above produces an SD card image that is in
exactly the same format as regular Raspberry Pi Linux distributions, so
the process for installing on an SD card is well-documented. On a 
Linux workstation, however, it's trivially easy:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
# dd if=pi.img of=/dev/sdXXX bs=128M 
</pre>

<p>
<code>/dev/sdXXX</code> should be replaced by the real device that corresponds
to the SD card. Of course, care must be taken here, because the <code>dd</code>
command will blithely overwrite a filesystem full of data. 
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>

<p>
The steps I described above are tedious, but they can easily be 
scripted. When scripted, the whole process takes about ten seconds on
a typical Linux workstation. A disadvantage of the process I describe
-- which applies to mainstream Pi Linux distributions as well --
is that the size of the root filesystem is set when the image is
created. Copying the image onto an SD card with larger capacity
doesn't get you a larger root filesystem at runtime. However, because
this is such a common problem, solutions to it are well documented.
