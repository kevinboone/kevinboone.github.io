Although calculus of variations has its origins in the 18th century, it is still not widely taught, either to science or engineering students. This brief guide intends to explain the basic principles, with a fully-worked example, in something that can be read in about an hour.</p><p style="font-size: smaller">Categories: <a href="mathematics-groupindex.html">mathematics</a></p>

<div class="article-desc"><img class="article-list-image" src="img/antenna.png"/><a href="hamming_bound.html">Understanding the Hamming 'sphere packing' bound in coding theory</a><p>The Hamming bound is an important metric in the evaluation of information coding schemes. It sets an upper limit on the number of distinct codewords that an error-correcting block code can provide, for a given block length. The Hamming bound is a benchmark for the evaluation of error correction schemes used in digital data storage and communication -- a scheme that meets the Hamming bound is described as perfect. In this article I try to describe, from first principles, how the Hamming bound is calculated.</p><p style="font-size: smaller">Categories: <a href="mathematics-groupindex.html">mathematics</a>, <a href="general_computing-groupindex.html">general computing</a></p>

<div class="article-desc"><img class="article-list-image" src="img/integral.jpg"/><a href="intfact.html">Integrating factors from the ground up</a><p>The use of integrating factors is a well-known method for turning an intractable differential equation into an integration problem (which may itself turn out to be intractable, but we live in hope). The method is usually described in textbooks and lectures with a fair amount of hand-waving. This article attempts to describe it in detail, with none of the difficulties left out.</p><p style="font-size: smaller">Categories: <a href="mathematics-groupindex.html">mathematics</a></p>

<div class="article-desc"><img class="article-list-image" src="img/notes.gif"/><a href="pitchfreq.html">Why pitch is not the same as frequency</a><p>In many cases, pitch is just the musician's way of saying frequency. However, pitch has a perceptual element to it, and the ear can be fooled. This article explains one of the ways in which this can happen, and why it isn't correct to use the terms pitch and frequency interchangeably in music.</p><p style="font-size: smaller">Categories: <a href="mathematics-groupindex.html">mathematics</a>, <a href="music-groupindex.html">music</a></p>

Being able to do this is essential for the implementation of cryptography, among other things. The arithmetic isn't particularly difficult -- particularly if we use software that specifically supports such operations. However, it's illustrative to do it manually, at least for a small field. I will demonstrate simple arithmetic in the field GF(5), by solving a quadratic equation.</p><p style="font-size: smaller">Categories: <a href="mathematics-groupindex.html">mathematics</a>, <a href="general_computing-groupindex.html">general computing</a></p>

<div class="article-desc"><img class="article-list-image" src="img/integral.jpg"/><a href="separation_variables.html">Differential equations: how does separation of variables really work?</a><p>'Separation of variables' is one of the first methods usually taught to math and engineering students for solving differential equations, and yet the method as taught is mathematically very sloppy. That's not to say it doesn't work, but rather that it isn't made clear why it works, and whether similar methods will work elsewhere. This article attempts to treat the subject with a bit of mathematical rigour. We end up exactly where we started but, perhaps, with a bit more insight.</p><p style="font-size: smaller">Categories: <a href="mathematics-groupindex.html">mathematics</a></p>
