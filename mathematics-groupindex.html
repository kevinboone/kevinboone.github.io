It sets an upper limit on the number of distinct codewords that an error-correcting block code can provide, for a given block length. The Hamming bound is a benchmark for the evaluation of error correction schemes used in digital data storage and communication -- a scheme that meets the Hamming bound is described as perfect. In this article I try to describe, from first principles, how the Hamming bound is calculated.</p><p style="font-size: smaller">Categories: <a href="mathematics-groupindex.html">mathematics</a>, <a href="general_computing-groupindex.html">general computing</a></p>

The method is usually described in textbooks and lectures with a fair amount of hand-waving. This article attempts to describe it in detail, with none of the difficulties left out.</p><p style="font-size: smaller">Categories: <a href="mathematics-groupindex.html">mathematics</a></p>

Being able to do this is essential for the implementation of cryptography, among other things. The arithmetic isn't particularly difficult -- particularly if we use software that specifically supports such operations. However, it's illustrative to do it manually, at least for a small field. I will demonstrate simple arithmetic in the field GF(5), by solving a quadratic equation.</p><p style="font-size: smaller">Categories: <a href="mathematics-groupindex.html">mathematics</a>, <a href="general_computing-groupindex.html">general computing</a></p>

That's not to say it doesn't work, but rather that it isn't made clear why it works, and whether similar methods will work elsewhere. This article attempts to treat the subject with a bit of mathematical rigour. We end up exactly where we started but, perhaps, with a bit more insight.</p><p style="font-size: smaller">Categories: <a href="mathematics-groupindex.html">mathematics</a></p>
