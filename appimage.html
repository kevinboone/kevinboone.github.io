<h1 id="appimage-from-scratch">AppImage from scratch</h1>
<p><img src="img/tux.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>An <a href="https://appimage.org/">AppImage</a> is a single file that
contains an entire Linux application. In most cases, it doesn’t require
any particular installation – the user just executes the file, and the
AppImage takes care of the rest. AppImage doesn’t automate the
collection or installation of an application’s dependencies – the
AppImage file is expected simply to provide them. All of them.
Technologies like <a href="flatpack.html">FlatPak and Snap</a> are
superficially similar, but these all require some management
infrastructure on the computer where the application is to run. AppImage
requires only the Linux desktop (sometimes not even that), and some
fudamental Linux utilities.</p>
<p>AppImage is increasingly popular, because it’s a very simple
technology for the end user. It’s not necessarily simple for the
application packager, but there are tools to help with that. Although
the tools are pretty well documented, I’ve not seen a lot of
documentation about how the technology operates fundamentally. It’s
possible that the developers of AppImage technology think it’s just too
simple to document. If so, I disagree and, in this article, I set out to
explain how AppImage works from first principles.</p>
<h2 id="fundamentals-of-the-appimage-technology">Fundamentals of the
AppImage technology</h2>
<p>We’re probably all familiar with the ‘executable installers’ and
‘self-extracting zipfiles’ that are commonplace in the Windows world. On
Linux, however, applications usually come in some kind of package, that
has to be unpacked and installed. The installation process is usually
coordinated by a package manager, in collaboration with a software
repository. The application package states what its dependencies (often
libraries) are, and the package management framework attempts to
resolve, obtain, and install the dependencies.</p>
<p>Tools like <code>yum</code> and <code>apt</code>, and the
repositories with which they interact, are very good at handling complex
dependency relationships. But what should we do when dependencies are
irreconcilably in conflict?</p>
<p>It’s also a problem that somebody has to provide packages for each
Linux variant, and often each <em>version</em> of each variant. In
practice, the maintainers of specific Linux distributions often shoulder
this burden, leading to a situation in which a package exists for some
Linux distributions and not for others. Sometimes the only way to get
the latest version of an application is to upgrade the entire Linux
installation.</p>
<p>AppImage solves these problems by supplying a single executable that
contains the entire application, along with all its dependencies, in
some executable, compressed format. It’s a bit like a self-extracting
zipfile, without the actual extraction – the compressed data is loaded
into memory every time the user runs the application.</p>
<p>So how can we supply a whole application, including all its
dependencies, in a single file, requiring no installation?</p>
<p>AppImage technology relies on three fundamental features of
Linux.</p>
<p>First, Linux doesn’t care what an executable file contains, so long
as the <em>start</em> of the file is executable. An AppImage has a small
executable header, followed by the application’s complete set of files
in a compressed format.</p>
<p>Second, Linux allows a file, or part of a file, to be mounted as a
filesystem. This is called <em>loopback mounting</em>. A filesystem
image is embedded in the AppImage at some known offset; at runtime, the
AppImage tells Linux to mount that filesystem on some temporary
directory.</p>
<p>Third, on modern Linux systems we can perform the loopback mount
<em>without elevated privileges</em>. You don’t need to be
<code>root</code> to mount the filesystem on a temporary director. The
technology that handles the mounting is called FUSE – Filesystem on
USerspacE.</p>
<p>At runtime, the AppImage header at the start of the AppImage file
locates the embedded filesystem, and uses FUSE to mount it on a
directory under <code>/tmp</code>. The header then runs a script in that
directory called <code>AppRun</code>, which sets up and runs the
application.</p>
<h2 id="building-an-appimage-style-application-from-scratch">Building an
AppImage-style application from scratch</h2>
<p>To explain how this all works in detail, I’ll describe how to build
an AppImage-style trivial application. Of course, you can build a
<em>real</em> AppImage, using tooling designed for that purpose. But
doing it from scratch is more educational. My example will, naturally,
be a lot simpler than a real AppImage, but it will use exactly the same
principles.</p>
<p>My application will be a simple shell script, that dumps a text file.
The application is AppImage-like because it embeds the script and the
text file in a single executable. It has an AppImage header, but mine is
just a shell script: real AppImages use a statically-linked binary as
the header, which does a lot more than my simple script.</p>
<p>I’ll show some of the source code in this article; the whole thing is
available from <a
href="https://github.com/kevinboone/appimage_from_scratch">my GitHub
repository</a>.</p>
<h3 id="compressing-the-filesystem">Compressing the filesystem</h3>
<p>In my example, the application’s filesystem will start life as a
directory called <code>appdir/</code>. My directory only contains two
files – the script that comprises the application (<code>run.sh</code>)
and the text file it dumps (<code>test.txt</code>). In a full-scale
application I would lay out the source directory like a complete root
filesystem, with subdirectories <code>/usr/lib</code>,
<code>/usr/bin</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>We’ll compress this directory into a complete filesystem image.
AppImages seem to use the SquashFS format; since the entire filesystem
has to be loaded into memory, and will usually be read-only, I guess it
makes sense to use a compressed format like this.</p>
<p>Turning <code>appdir/</code> into a SquashFS filesystem is easy:</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir build
$ mksquashfs appdir/ build/appdir.img</code></pre>
<p><code>mksquashfs</code> might not be installed by default; it’s
typically part of a package called <code>squashfs-tools</code>. The
utility has hundreds of command-line switches, but the defaults are fine
for this simple demonstration.</p>
<p><code>appdir.img</code> is the compressed image that
<code>mksquashfs</code> outputs. If we wanted, we could mount this on a
directory using <code>squashfuse</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ squashfuse build/appdir.img /tmp/some_directory </code></pre>
<p>In fact, in my example, it’s the AppImage(-style) header that will
run <code>squashfuse</code> – this has to be done when running the
application, not building it.</p>
<h3 id="the-appimage-style-header">The AppImage(-style) header</h3>
<p>My build process appends the SquashFS filesystem image
<code>appdir.img</code> to a file header which, in this demo, is just a
shell script. Here it is, in its entirety:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

my_dir=/tmp/app_mount.$$

mkdir -p $my_dir
squashfuse -o offset=NNNN $0 $my_dir

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$my_dir/usr/lib:$my_dir/usr/lib64
$my_dir/run.sh

fusermount -u $my_dir
rmdir $my_dir

exit</code></pre>
<p>The SquashFS filesytem gets appended after the <code>exit</code>
line, which is necessary to ensure that the shell doesn’t try to execute
the filesystem data after the application has finished.</p>
<p>The first thing the script does to create a directory on which it
will mount the SquashFS filesystem. To reduce the likelihood of
different applications using the same directory, we append the process
ID (<code>$$</code>).</p>
<p>Then the script mounts the filesystem whose data follows the
<code>exit</code> line. It uses <code>squashfuse</code> to do this, with
an <code>offset</code> argument. While building the application’s
executable, we must change</p>
<pre><code>offset=NNNN</code></pre>
<p>to the actual length of the header (and thus the start of the
embedded filesystem). There are many ways to do this (see
<code>build.sh</code> for how I do it, but I don’t claim it’s
optimal).</p>
<p>I should point out that not all Linux installations will have
<code>squashfuse</code> by default (try
<code>apt install squashfuse</code> or
<code>yum install squashfuse</code>). Real AppImages don’t rely on this
utility – I assume that the AppImage header replicates its functionality
internally. The ‘real’ method is better, as it doesn’t rely on a Linux
package that not everybody will have; but I couldn’t think of a way to
replicate the behaviour of <code>squashfuse</code> in a shell script
alone.</p>
<p>The script then sets the environment variable
<code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, to tell the Linux loader where to look for
shared library (<code>.so</code>) files. My example doesn’t actually
need any such libraries, but most real application will. The AppImage
builder (whether that’s a person or a software tool) will usually put
<code>.so</code> files in <code>usr/lib</code> or
<code>usr/lib64</code>, as the maintainer of a traditional package
would. The Linux loader will prefer the libraries in
<code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> over the default ones in <code>/lib</code>,
etc., but will fall back on the defaults for libraries the AppImage
doesn’t provide.</p>
<p>Then the header runs the application – <code>run.sh</code> in this
case. When the application completes (or is killed) the header unmounts
the filesystem and deletes the temporary directory.</p>
<h3 id="the-application">The application</h3>
<p>My application is very simple: it just prints a text file.</p>
<pre><code>my_dir=&quot;$(readlink -f &quot;$(dirname &quot;$0&quot;)&quot;)&quot;
echo Printing test.txt:
cat $my_dir/test.txt</code></pre>
<p>Note, though, that the application needs to work out where the text
file actually is. Other that shared libraries, which are handled by
setting <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, the application will need to
perform this computation for every file that is bundled with the
application. This is potentially a significant limitation of the
AppImage technology, which I’ll discuss later.</p>
<h3 id="building-the-appimage">Building the AppImage</h3>
<p>This is just basic Linux shell scripting – please see
<code>build.sh</code>. All the build does is concatenate the
AppImage(-style) header and the SquashFS filesystem, adjusting the
header to indicate the offset of the filesystem in the final file.</p>
<h2 id="appimage-in-practice">AppImage in practice</h2>
<p>My simple example works in the same way as a real AppImage, but it
doesn’t have to manage any dependencies, and that’s where the real
problems begin. In practice, I think that most AppImage maintainers use
tools like <a
href="https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy">linuxdeploy</a> to
handle the dependency management. This tool scans an executable, and
tries to work out what libraries it depends on. It copies these
libraries to a directory, which can then be used as the basis for the
SquashFS filesystem.</p>
<p>This scanning process isn’t foolproof, particularly if the
application loads libraries explicitly at runtime (so library
information is absent from the application’s executable). Still, it’s a
start.</p>
<p>Another approach to managing AppImage dependencies is to leverage a
platform’s existing dependency framework. If applications are available
as packages (<code>.deb</code>, <code>.rpm</code>, etc), then the
package file should already contain dependency information. It should be
possible for AppImage tooling to resolve the dependencies in the same
way that a platform’s package manager would.</p>
<p>However, not all applications are easy to convert into AppImage form,
even if the dependencies are clear. To work as an AppImage, the
application must usually be <em>relocatable</em>. A relocatable
application, in this context, is one that could just be unpacked into an
arbitrary directory and executed there. Any application that is written
to look for its own files at specific locations will need to be
modified, perhaps extensively, to use locations in the mounted SquashFS
filesystem.</p>
<p>Some of this modification can be automated, but probably not all,
because some files <em>may</em> have be at specific filesystem
locations. If an application uses configuration files in
<code>/etc/</code>, for example, or <code>$HOME/.config</code>, these
references <em>shouldn’t</em> be changed to files in the SquashFS
filesystem. Apart from anything else, it’s read-only.</p>
<p>In practice, it takes a lot of self-discipline maintain a complex
application that is completely relocatable, and most likely it’s only
the authors of the application that know how to do this. Converting an
existing application – particularly a large one – to be relocatable can
be hugely complicated.</p>
<h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h2>
<p>In this article, I demonstrated how to build an AppImage-style
application, using only shell scripts and commonplace utilities. My
approach is conceptually similar to real AppImage technology, but a lot
simpler.</p>
<p>Building an AppImage-like package from scratch does highlight a lot
of the limitations of the technology, particularly those related to
making the application relocatable. I don’t think anybody would use my
all-manual approach to package a full-scale application, but I’m sure it
would work, with sufficient patience. Real AppImages are typically built
with the assistance of a lot of tooling.</p>
<p>When we see how AppImage works at the platform level, we can
appreciate how inefficient this technology can be. It’s inefficient in
storage because, in practice, multiple AppImage packages are likely
providing copies of exactly the same dependencies. It’s inefficient in
resources, because the entire AppImage has to be loaded into memory at
runtime. To be fair, it’s really mapped into <em>virtual</em> memory, so
unused parts of the application use little to no RAM. Still, the
run-time decompression of the parts that <em>are</em> used will use some
CPU. Given how Linux caches filesystem data, that overhead is probably
not significant on a modern, desktop Linux. AppImage might be unsuitable
for low-resource or embedded Linux systems. For the desktop, many users
will likely find the inefficient use of resources a small price to pay
for the simplicity.</p>
<p>AppImage technology is less sophisticated than FlatPak, Snap, Docker,
Podman, etc. Any sophistication has to be provided by the AppImage
tooling, not the platform. For example, in lieu of a framework for
keeping AppImage applications up to date, tooling can incorporate a
complete auto-update mechanism into each AppImage application. While
this is an interesting development, I can’t help thinking that there are
better ways to do what AppImage does, for users that need that kind of
automation.</p>
<p>It should also be clear the AppImage is not a container technology.
AppImage applications are not sandboxed, or isolated from one another.
Concerns about security are making the use of lightweight containers a
popular way to run applications that the user doesn’t entirely trust. Of
course, AppImage is no <em>worse</em> in this respect that the
traditional method of packaging Linux applications: we still have to
trust the supplier of the package.</p>
