<h1>Command-line hacking: displaying system temperature</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/terminal.png" 
  alt="display"/>
This is another in my series of articles on doing unusual and, 
perhaps, interesting things with Linux command-line tools and scripts. 
The purpose of this week's exercise is to create a formatted display of
system temperatures from the various sensors, using only
Bash constructs. This example is significantly
simpler than some of my earlier ones, although it demonstrates basic file
and string handling in Bash.
</p>
<p>
The output of the script is something like this:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
               zone   temp
              ------   -----
              acpitz   46
        x86_pkg_temp   46
         pch_skylake   52
</pre>
<p>
I'll touch on interpretation of the zone (sensor) names later.
</p>
<p>
As ever, 
full source code is available
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/temp.sh">in my GitHub repository</a>,
although this example is simple enough that I'll include most of the
code in the article.
</p>
<p>
Modern CPUs and motherboards have multiple temperature sensors. Drivers
in the Linux kernel make their readings available as pseudo-files in
the directories <code>/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zoneNNN/</code>. 
Unfortunately, there's no single pseudo-file that can be displayed, that
will give a nice, formatted display of all the temperatures, which
is what this script tries to do.
</p>
<p>
Within each of the <code>thermal_zoneNNN</code> directories are two
pseudo-files that are relevant here. <code>type</code> gives the name
of the temperature sensor, while <code>temp</code> is the temperature
itself.
</p>
<p>
The temperature is, according to the kernel documentation, supplied as a 
string of exactly five decimal digits, representing the temperature in
millicelsius. So, to get an ordinary Celsius temperature, we must 
divide by 1000. That's easy: just take the top two digits of the
five, and ignore the rest.
This process will round the temperature <i>down</i>, so
a temperature of 49900 will be reported as 49 degrees when, ideally,
it should be rounded to the nearest integer. Alternatively, we could
display the first three digits with a decimal point between them
("49.9") Both these approaches are left as an exercise to the reader --
simply inserting the decimal point is straightforward in a Bash script,
but rounding to the nearest integer requires some real math. I'm happy
with a result that is within a degree or so of the true value, and these
sensors aren't hugely accurate, anyway.
</p>
<p>
The first task in the script is to gather a list of the 
<code>thermal_zoneNNN</code> directories. The way I've chosen to
do this is shown below, but I'm sure there are many other possibilities.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#009900">SCT</font><font color="#990000">=</font>/sys/class/thermal

<b><font color="#0000FF">for</font></b> zone <b><font color="#0000FF">in</font></b> `find <font color="#009900">$SCT</font> -name thermal_zone<font color="#990000">*</font> -exec basename {} <font color="#990000">\;</font> `
<b><font color="#0000FF">do</font></b>
  <font color="#990000">...</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">done</font></b>
</pre>

<p>
There's no functional need to assign <code>/sys/class/thermal</code> to a
variable but, as it will be used many times, doing this tidies up the
script a little. The <code>for</code> loop will execute once for each
<code>thermal_zoneNNN</code> directory, with <code>zone</code> set to the
directory name. 
</p>

<p>
If any of the directory names might have contained spaces, we'd have to be
a lot more careful about how the names are handled. In this case,
however, there cannot be spaces in any of the directory names.
</p>

<p>
Within each <code>thermal_zoneNNN</code> directory, we need to read
<code>temp</code> and <code>type</code> into variables. A common way
to read a file into a variable is:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#009900">my_var</font><font color="#990000">=</font>`cat /path/to/file`
</pre>

<p>
Bash experts discourage this kind of thing, because it spawns an extra
process, when there's no real need to. I confess that I use this 
construct all the time, because it's so easy to read. However, let's try
to be more modern.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">   <b><font color="#0000FF">type</font></b><font color="#990000">=</font><font color="#009900">$(&lt;/$SCT/$zone/type)</font>
   <font color="#009900">temp</font><font color="#990000">=</font><font color="#009900">$(&lt;$SCT/$zone/temp)</font>
</pre>

<p>
This approach uses the &lt; syntax, so it isn't totally unfamiliar to a shell
programmer. Still, I confess that I often forget the exact syntax.
</p>

<p>
This is where things get a little interesting, from a shell programming
point of view. On some Linux system, the <code>temp</code> pseudo-file
does not supply a temperature, and trying to read it will result in
an error. This is the case even though the file exists, and has read
permissions. So what does <code>temp</code> end up containing?
</p>

<p>
It turns out to be an empty string -- which is fine in this simple example.
A valid temperature will never be an empty string, so we don't have to
try to distinguish between valid empty strings and errors. But what happens
if a script has to read a file or pseudo-file that might actually 
<code>validly</code> be empty? When we use the &lt; syntax, I'm not sure
there's a way to find out whether the file was present but empty, or
whether a read error occurred. 
</p>

<p>
If we <i>do</i> need to make this distinction, one possibility might
be to use the <code>read</code> call, which returns an error status.
Here is one way to tell whether a file is actually readable, when it
might be empty:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">  <font color="#009900">ok</font><font color="#990000">=</font><font color="#FF0000">""</font>
  <b><font color="#0000FF">read</font></b> -n <font color="#993399">1</font> <font color="#990000">&lt;</font> /path/to/file <font color="#990000">&gt;&amp;</font> /dev/null <font color="#990000">&amp;&amp;</font> <font color="#009900">ok</font><font color="#990000">=</font><font color="#FF0000">"1"</font>   
  <b><font color="#0000FF">if</font></b> <font color="#990000">[</font> <font color="#990000">!</font> -z <font color="#009900">$ok</font> <font color="#990000">]</font> <font color="#990000">...</font> <i><font color="#9A1900">#File is actually readable</font></i>
</pre>

<p>
This is a rather ugly construction, and I'd be interested to know whether
there's a nicer one. In practice, when writing shell scripts, it's usually
fine to assume that if a file exists, and the user has read permission,
a read operation will succeed. We don't normally need to be more paranoid
than that. However, when handling files that are actually interfaces to
drivers, oddities can arise, that need to be handled. Happily, in this
simple example, it's safe to assume that reading an empty string represents
an error condition, so we don't have to be too paranoid.
</p>

<p>
With the zone name and the temperature in variables, we just need
to format them nicely. To reduce the temperature to an integer, we
just extract the first two digits, like this:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">  <font color="#009900">temp</font><font color="#990000">=</font><font color="#009900">${temp:0:2}</font>
</pre>
<p>
This construct means 'take two characters, starting at position zero'.
Exercise for the reader: does this still work for multibyte characters?
We don't have to worry about that here, but sometimes we do.
</p>

<p>
To format the display so that the temperatures are aligned, we can 
use the <code>printf</code> command. 
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">  <b><font color="#0000FF">printf</font></b> <font color="#FF0000">"%20s   %s</font><font color="#CC33CC">\n</font><font color="#FF0000">"</font> <font color="#009900">$type</font> <font color="#009900">$temp</font>
</pre>

<p>
This command should be familiar to C programmers. The first argument
controls the format of the arguments that follow. <code>%s</code> in
general denotes a simple text string; <code>%20s</code> pads
a string so that it is exactly twenty characters wide.
</p>

<p>
Finally, how do we know how to interpret the sensor names? The sad fact is
that, on the whole, we don't. These names are supplied by drivers
in the kernel, based on what sensors it detects by probing the motherboard.
From experience I know that <code>x86_pkg_temp</code> is usually the CPU
die temperature on x86 systems, while <code>acpitz</code> usually comes 
from a motherboard sensor mounted close to the CPU. ARM Linux
systems that use the 'Big.Little' architecture seem to report the
'Big', 'Middle', and 'Little' cores with their own <code>thermal_zone</code>
entries. <code>g3d</code> is probably an integrated graphics controller.  
</p>
<p>
For the record, in my example <code>pch_skylake</code> 
is the Platform Hub Controller.
This would once have been a separate chip on Intel-compatible
motherboards but, these days, is probably part of the CPU die. 
It isn't unusual for this to record a higher temperature than
<code>x86_pkg_temp</code> or, of course, not to be present at
all: the exact sensors will depend on the motherboard and CPU
design. 
</p>
<p>
In short, interpretation of the thermal zone names will
likely take a bit of web searching.
