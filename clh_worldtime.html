<h1>Command-line hacking: timezone conversions</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/terminal.png" 
  alt="display"/>
This is another in my series of articles on doing unusual and, 
perhaps, interesting things with Linux command-line tools and scripts. 
The purpose of this week's exercise is to create a display of
times around the world, corresponding to a particular time at a 
particular place. 
</p>
<p>
Why? Well, it's a thing I freqently need to do in my work. I need to
schedule video meetings with clients and colleagues in 
particular places, and
it can be awkward to find a time that suits everybody. So when a
client suggests, say, 10AM in Calcutta, I need to know 
whether that will work
for me, in London, and a colleague in, say, New York. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, there are many on-line services that can provide this
information. But it's easier -- for me at least -- just to run
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
$ worldtime 10:00 calcutta
</pre>

<p>
and get an information dump like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
Note: using timzone Asia/Calcutta
Chicago:     23:30 CDT
India:       10:00 IST
Jerusalem:   07:30 IDT
London:      05:30 BST
Paris:       06:30 CEST
Los Angeles: 21:30 PDT
New York:    00:30 EDT
Singapore:   12:30 +08
Sydney:      14:30 AEST
</pre>

<p>
Of course, this list is of places where I have colleagues and clients;
it needs to be easy to customize the output to suit a different
person's needs.
</p>
<p>
I haven't included the full source code in this article, because it's
too long. If you're interested, the full source 
for <code>worldtime</code> is available  
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/worldtime" 
	target="_blank">from my GitHub repository</a>.
</p>


<h2>Basic principle</h2>
<p>
The key utility here is the standard GNU <code>date</code>, which is
installed by default in most Linux distributions. This utility
has a neat feature for specifying the input timezone. For example,
for 12:34 in Paris (France), I can do this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ date --date "TZ=\"Europe/Paris\" 12:34"
Thu  4 Aug 11:34:00 BST 2022
</pre>

<p>
That tells me that it's 11:34 BST where I am, in London. 
The format of the <code>--date</code> argument is a little fiddly,
when it comes to scripting: it contains both spaces and double-quotes.
So I need an outer pair of double-quotes to group the "TZ" string and
the time together into one argument; then I need double-quotes 
within this group to
group "Europe/Paris" (even though it does not contain spaces --
that's just how <code>date</code> rolls).
</p>

<p>
Bash being what it is, I could use double-quotes within single-quotes
to avoid the need to escape the inner double-quotes. But that will make
it awkward to use variables in the argument, rather than the 
literals in the example above. 
</p>
<p>
So there is a way to get my local time for a time in a different
geographic location. But how do we get the time in some other location?
</p>
<p>
We can do this by setting the TZ environemnt variable for the
invocation of <code>date</code> as a whole (in addition to setting
it in the <code>--date</code> argument). So to find the time in 
New York when it's 12:34 in Paris, I need:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ TZ=America/New_York date --date "TZ=\"Europe/Paris\" 12:34"
</pre>

<p>
This is the kind of thing that needs to be wrapped up in a script,
because the format of the command is something that I, at least,
will not easily remember.
</p>

<h2>Using short location names</h2>
<p>
It's nice to be able to use short location names. While its 
unambiguous to say: 
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ worldtime 10:00 Europe/Paris 
</pre>

<p>
it's much quicker to type
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ worldtime 10:00 paris 
</pre>

<p>
We can get the full location name ("Europe/Paris") from the string
"paris" by running:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ timedatectl list-timezones | grep -i -m 1 paris 
</pre>

<p>
The <code>-m 1</code> argument specifies that only the first match
should be reported. A more elegant solution, I guess, would be to
have the script stop if there are, in fact, multiple matches.
In any event, the script will print the actual value of the
timezone region found in the list, so the user doesn't get
bizarre results without an explanation. 
</p>

<h2>Building the list</h2>
<p>
There's a compromise to be struck, between including too much information
in the output, and too little. I've specifically tailored the
output to the regions I work with. The script could easily print
pages and pages of information, for locations all over the world,
but it would difficult to interpret.
</p>
<p>
If you just want to display a few cities, it's easy just to have the
script invoke <code>date</code> repeatedly. However, it's nicer
to use an array, which makes the script easily extensible.
</p>
<p>
There are various ways to handle an array, but the (simple) approach
I've adopted is to put the names of the cities, and the corresponding
timezone region names, into a one-dimensional array in alternating
locations. It's worth asking why the city names are needed at all.
The script could just display the timezone location. That's true, but
displaying a city just looks nicer. Or so it seems to me.
</p>
<p>
So my array looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
REGIONS=("Chicago:     " "America/Chicago"
# Note -- India has only one timezone
         "India:       " "Asia/Kolkata"
         "Jerusalem:   " "Asia/Jerusalem"
#...
         "Sydney:      " "Australia/Sydney")
</pre>

<p>
Note that <code>bash</code> uses parentheses to group array elements,
which is different from most popular programming languages. 
We can iterate the array like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
for (( i = 0; i < ${#REGIONS[@]}; i+=2 )); do
  CITY="${REGIONS[$i]}" 
  TIMEZONE_REGION=${REGIONS[$i + 1]} 
  #....
done
</pre>

<p>
We need to iterate the array in units of two (<code>i+=2</code>),
because the data are paired. The first element (the city name)
of the pair is <code>${REGIONS[$i]}</code>, while the second 
(the timezone region)
is  <code>${REGIONS[$i + 1]}</code>. The length of the array is
obtained by the rather odd, easy-to-forget, formulation
<code>${#REGIONS[@]}</code>. 
</p>

<h2>Further work</h2>

<p>
The next step -- left as an exercise for the reader -- is to 
format the output to make it cleared whether a particular time
is likely to be within a region's typical working hours. Of course,
this can only be approximate. A clever implementation would take into
account the fact that different locations have different workdays
in the week. However, since the script does not deal with dates at
all -- only times -- that would require extensive modifications.
</p>
<p>
Happy scripting.
