<h1>Some thoughts on the Waveshare 3.5-inch LCD/SD module for the Raspberry Pi Pico</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/chip.png" 
  alt="Chip logo"/>
The <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Pico-ResTouch-LCD-3.5"
  target="_blank">Waveshare 3.5" Pico LCD module</a> is a convenient
and inexpensive way to add a useable screen to the Pi Pico. In the UK,
the single-unit price of this device can be less than &pound;20.
The unit includes an SD card interface and a resistive touch digitizer.
The screen resolution is 320x240 pixels, which makes it usable for displaying
text and menus -- provided the operator isn't too far away. This collection
of features is ideal for implementing equipment that displays data or
images from an SD card.
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>This article is specifically about the Waveshare 3.5" LCD panel with 320x240 pixel resolution and 16-bit colour. There are similar-looking devices with completely different interfaces, and nothing I write in this article should be assumed to apply to those. Sorry.</blockquote>

<p>
Waveshare provides very little information about programming the LCD unit
in C, although there is source for a sample application (which did not work
    for me). In this article I will try to provide some of the missing information,
   and give an honest appraisal of whether the LCD panel is a worth using.
Of course, it has to be kept in mind that it's very cheap -- it's rather
hard to find serious fault with something that offers so many features at
such low cost. Still, it isn't perfect, by any means.
</p>

<h2>Layout and construction</h2>
<p>
The LCD module connects directly to the Pico without a cable, as shown
in the photo below.
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="img/waveshare_lcd.jpg" alt="photo of Waveshare LCD"/>
</p>
<p>
This makes for a neat arrangement, when it comes to desktop experimentation.
It's not particularly easy, however, to mount the display in a case. 
It's particularly awkward if you want to use the Pico's USB socket, which
points upwards from the top of the board. You don't have to power the
unit using a USB cable, but it's worth bearing in mind that the LCD module is 
a 5V device, not a 3.3V device as the Pico itself is. Note that the
SD card slot also points upwards. I imagine that the SD slot could
be used with an SD extender cable, if this mounting position proved to
be inconvenient. At the sort of bus speeds an Pico can manage, I guess that
wiring the SD card a few inches from the board won't be a problem. 
</p>
<p>
The LCD module displays pixels right up to its very thin bezels -- up to
a couple of millimetres from the edges of the module, in fact. If you
wanted to mount the display in a case, you'd need a very accurate panel
cut-out. 
</p>
<p>
With the Pico in position, the complete assembly is about 20 mm thick,
58mm tall, and 86mm wide.
</p>
<p>
It's worth bearing in mind that, despite the overall design, the LCD module
is <i>not</i> a landscape-orientation module. It's a portrait module, 
rotated through ninety degrees. Is this a problem? For many applications, no,
it won't be -- so long as you're careful how you interpret the controller
datasheet. In the datasheet, 'width' denotes the short side of the
display, as if it were in portrait orientation. 
</p>
<p>
This layout does create some subtle problems, however, particularly 
related to scrolling. I will return to this point later.
</p>


<h2>General design</h2>
<p>
The LCD panel has a 16-bit parallel interface. This is highly 
appropriate as it uses a 16-bit colour format (more on this later). 
However, to minimize the number of Pico GPIO pins that are used, the
hardware includes an SPI interface to the panel controller and, 
so far as I know, SPI is
the only way to drive the display. 
</p>
<p>
The Waveshare documentation refers to both the Ilitek ILI9388 and the 
Sitronix ST7789 LCD controller ICs. I do not know which of these is actually
used or if they are, in fact, equivalent. Looking at the 
datasheets of both, they seem very similar, with the same registers and
commands. The ILI9388 claims 24-bit colour support while the ST7789 
has only 18-bit. But, with a 16-bit LCD panel, the distinction is,
perhaps, unimportant. I referred to the ST7789 datasheet in my 
own development -- and you'll certainly need a datasheet for any 
serious application. 
</p>
<p>
The SD card interface is also connected to the SPI bus, although
the card's SDIO pins are <i>maybe</i> also connected to Pico GPIO pins. This
means that, in principle, you could operate the SD card in the,
much faster, SDIO mode, rather than using plain SPI. However, I am not
sure that anybody has actually succeeded in interfacing the Pico
with an SD card in this mode -- the Waveshare sample code does not
do so. 
</p>
<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>There are jumpers on the LCD module board that appear to control whether the SD card uses SPI or SDIO mode. I presume that, in the SPI position, the SDIO pins on the SD card are not connected to GPIO pins, so these pins could be used for something else. However, I haven't tested this, so I can't be sure. None of the board jumpers -- of which there are quite a few -- appear to be documented.</blockquote>
<p>
The SD card slot does not include a media detection function,
so far as I can see. So the only way to detect whether a card has been
inserted or removed is to try read it, and see what happens.  
</p>
<p>
The touch digitizer controller is an XPT2046, again on SPI. It only has
five-bit position resolution so, even with calibration, won't detect the
exact pixel where a touch occurred. It's a resistive sensor, and fairly
slow to respond. 
</p>
<p>
All three SPI devices use the same SPI bus (SPI-1) on the Pico. As
a result, three GPIO pins are dedicated to chip select functions. The
touch controller also has an interrupt line which is connected to a 
GPIO pin, although I am not sure how it is expected to be used. There
is also a GPIO pin for the screen backlight. As a result, the 
LCD/SD module uses a total of 15 GPIO pins. 
</p>
<p>
The number of pins used might be moot, since there's no straightforward
way to attach any other hardware to the Pico once it's connected
to the LCD module. 
</p>

<h2>LCD display</h2>
<p>
It goes without saying, at this price, that the display is a backlit
IPS panel, and not a self-illuminating OLED or something similarly fancy.
</p>
<p>
The display contains its own memory -- two bytes for each pixel, 
thus totalling about 300kB. A problem should be immediately apparent --
this is larger than the Pico's RAM. There's no prospect of building up
an image in RAM and then transferring it to the LCD in one operation --
there simply isn't enough RAM. However, it is possible to transfer data
in regions of any size, and block-by-block is probably 
the best way to manage the
display. 
</p>

<p>
The basic method for setting a block of display memory is as follows. (1) Set
the starting column and ending column registers; (2) set the starting line
and ending line registers; (3) send exactly enough 16-bit values to
fill the screen region selected. 
</p>

<p>
It should be obvious that the <i>least</i> efficient way to write the
display is pixel-by-pixel. The Waveshare sample code shows this being
done by selecting a 1-pixel region of screen and then writing a "block" of
one 16-bit pixel colour value. I do not know if there is a faster way 
to set a single pixel
than this. This requires a total of thirteen, byte-wide SPI operations, of
which only two set the actual pixel colour. With an SPI bus speed of 
(say) 8 MHz, writing the entire display this way will take just under
two seconds.  
</p>

<p>
Transferring the data in blocks is more efficient, because the amount
of SPI data to be sent is smaller, in proportion to the number of pixels.
However, at 8 MHz, it's still going to take at least 300 msec to 
draw the entire display. And that's assuming that the data to be displayed
is already neatly arranged in RAM somewhere -- which, of course, it won't
be, because there isn't enough RAM.
</p>

<p>
The LCD display works best when reading pre-formatted data from the SD
card directly to the display. By 'pre-formatted' I mean that the image
to be displayed is exactly 480x320 pixels, and is in the expected
16-bit format. To be fair, I guess this is the kind of application the
designers of the unit had in mind.
</p>

<p>
The colour format of the display is RGB565, that is, five red bits, 
six green bits, and five blue bits for each pixel.
It's easy to convert to this format
from more common colour representations although, of course, the bit-bashing
takes time.
</p>

<p>
The LCD backlight, which can be turned on and off using the appropriate
GPIO pin, is bright -- but not particularly even.
</p>


<h2>SD card</h2>
<p>
The SD card slot is connected to the same SPI bus, SPI-1, as the display,
and this can't be changed. The Pico program selects which device to use
by asserting the appropriate chip-select line (they are all active-low).
In principle, operations on the SPI bus
should be synchronized (e.g., using mutexes) if you're likely to be 
doing any kind of multi-tasking. I haven't tried this -- frankly, it
seems altogether too scary. 
</p>

<p>
SD cards are usually supplied pre-formatted as FAT or exFAT; there's 
plenty of information and sample code for using these formats with the
Pico. I've done most of my testing using a SanDisk 16Gb card, and it 
works fine. If the application calls for the SD card to be changed at
runtime, some fairly careful programming will be needed -- these cards
have a fairly complex initialization sequence, that has to be repeated
whenever a card is changed. 
</p>

<h2>Reset button</h2>

<p>
Not a killer feature, but a convenient one: the LCD module has a handy
reset button on the top edge. It stands a little proud of the edge of
the display, which is something that will have to be taken into account
if the display is mounted in a case.
</p>

<h2>Display scrolling</h2>
<p>
The built-in controller has hardware scrolling capabilities. However, this
is where the limitation of using a portrait-format display in landscape
mode is really obvious: the hardware scroller only works along the long
axis of the display. That is, with the display mounted in landscape
orientation, you'll only be able to scroll <i>horizontally</i>.
</p>
<p>
Of course, you can implement the scrolling yourself, by reading lines of
the display and writing them at new positions. Unfortunately, this takes
about three seconds to scroll the entire screen -- not at all practicable.
</p>
<p>
Still, if you can use it, the hardware scrolling is very fast. That's because
it doesn't move any memory at all. All that happens is that the application
controls what row in memory should be at the top of the display, and the
controller starts drawing on the panel from that point. When it gets to
the end of memory, the controller wraps around to the start. So scrolling is a 
"circular" operation: if you set the scroller's top line to the middle of
memory, you'll see the data at the start of memory appear half-way down
the screen, while the top of the screen shows the second half of the memory.
</p>
<p>
Managing scrolling this way is a head-scratcher for the application developer,
but it's effective once understood. It's just a shame that hardware scrolling
only works in portrait orientation -- something that is not at all clear
in the advertising.
</p>

<h2>Speed considerations</h2>

<p>
In the end, I think speed is likely to be the deciding factor in whether
this LCD/SD module is usable or not. Fundamentally, a display with
~160,000 addressable pixels and a serial SPI interface is just too 
big for the Pico. Not physically too big -- it's a good size for
many applications -- but requiring too much data to be transferred.
Since the display memory is larger than the Pico's RAM, the display
will always have to be generated directly on the LCD module, unless
you're doing something like a straightforward image dump from an SD
card. 
</p>

<p>
Because all the SPI interfaces (display, SD, touch digitizer) run on
the same SPI bus, the selected bus speed will have to suit all the devices.
Alternatively, the application could change the SPI bus speed according
to the device that is to be used -- but this is potentially problematic,
because the speed takes some time to settle. 
</p>

<p>
According to the Waveshare documentation, the display should be able to 
handle a 
bus speed of 60 MHz. I'm not convinced that we can rely on SD cards to
work at this speed. Some probably will, but I've seen cards that won't
work reliably at more than about 1 MHz. The SanDisk cards I usually use
are fine at 12.5 MHz, and probably fine at 20 MHz. I say 'probably' because
sometimes the card will not initialize at this speed. It's conventional
to do the first stage of SD initialization at a very low speed -- perhaps
400 kHz -- and then build up speed. However, even with this approach,
I don't get perfectly reliable initialization with all cards when running
at 20 MHz.    
</p>
<p>
My usual speed for testing, which works fine with all the branded cards
I've tried, is 12.5 MHz. This gives a maximum frame rate of about one 
frame per second, assuming that no calculation has to be done during
the update. This is fine for drawing simple menus, and displaying
text in a terminal-like way. I don't think it would be adequate for 
displaying a complex graphical user interface.
</p>
<p>
Even a trivial operation like setting the whole display to a single colour
is time-consuming. The controller provides no way to do this except using
the same SPI interface that is used to set specific pixels. The SPI
functions provided by the Pico C SDK work best when transferring large
blocks of data -- particularly when DMA can be used. However, you're
never going to be able to transfer a whole screen-full of data, because
the Pico doesn't have that much RAM. The C SDK doesn't provide a way
to send the same value repeatedly using SPI, so even setting blocks the
same colour requires an uncomfortable trade-off between RAM usage and
speed.
</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>
The Waveshare 3.5" lCD/SD module has enough screen resolution for some
fairly sophisticated displays -- provided you're not in too much of a 
hurry. With a display with this many pixels, speed is likely to be the
limiting factor in usefulness. 
</p>

<p>
The SD card interface works reliably at 12.5 MHz (that's 1 Mbit/sec or so),
and reasonably reliably at 20 MHz. There's no media detection, so 
switching cards at runtime is likely to be a challenge for the programmer.
</p>

<p>
The touch digitizer is slow to respond, with a low-ish resolution. The
module is supplied with a stylus, but I'm not sure that an application that
needed the fine control of a stylus would work very well. It's fine for
handling user interface buttons of fingertip size.
</p>

<p>
As I suggested at the start of this article, it's hard to fault something
that offers the features of this unit at such a low price. The faults that
it has are not in its implementation, but are likely inevitable when using such
a high-resolution display with a controller with so little RAM. 
However, the lack of 
documentation doesn't make the developer's work any easier.
