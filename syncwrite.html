<h1>Why synchronous write speed is likely to be the limiting factor in message broker throughput</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/activemq-logo.png" 
  alt="ActiveMQ logo"/>
  Administrators of middleware message brokers often struggle to get
  adequate throughput from their brokers. A lot of time and effort 
  can be wasted, if the
  administrator doesn't appreciate the crucial role of synchronous
  disk writes in these installations. Even a disk storage system that is
  promoted as being "fast" may perform badly in this area.
</p>
<p>
In this article, I will explain why synchronous write performance is such
a big deal, and some of the factors that affect it.
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>This article mostly focuses on Unix-like systems, but the basic principles apply to all modern operating systems.</blockquote>

<h2>Message brokers are journalling systems</h2>

<p>
All the message brokers I know about, that use persistent storage, are
<i>journalling</i>. This means that, regardless of the operation the client
performs (produce message, consume message, start transaction...) the
journal is extended with new data. The journal itself will be implemented
as one or more files (often many files) on a disk.
</p>

<p>
At first sight, it might appear that consuming a message from a message
queue would cause the amount of storage used by the broker to decrease.
In a journalling system, this is not usually the case. Instead, a record
is added to the journal that indicates that a message was consumed and
is, therefore, no longer available on the queue. In order to avoid the
journal growing without limit, some background process in the broker
will remove journal files when they no longer contain live data. 
</p>

<p>
In short, in a journalling message broker <i>all operations are disk write
operations</i>. 
</p>

<h2>Journals have to be written synchronously</h2>

<p>
Not only are all broker operations disk writes on the journal, the journal
usually has to be written <i>synchronously</i>. In this context, I mean
that the low-level write operation must not complete until the broker is
as certain as it reasonably can be, that the journal update has actually
been written to the physical disk hardware. Most (all?) 
operating systems will apply 
substantial caching in the disk system, to improve overall 
system performance. A write operation, as carried out by an application
program, will typically complete once the write has been accepted and
queued by 
the operating system. The data may not be written to the actual
physical disk for some time -- sometimes tens of seconds. 
</p>

<p>
If the broker crashes between the time at which the write is 
confirmed by the operating system, and the time at which the data is
actually committed to the disk, then all of the data handled by the
broker during that period is in doubt. Worse, any clients of the
broker will have been told that their operations completed successfully,
and usually there is no way to communicate the error to the client
later. 
</p>

<p>
As a result, the broker designers will try to minimize the amount of
time for which the journal data is in doubt, and one way to do that
is to insist that the operating system flush the message data to
disk at the exact time it is written.
</p>

<h2>Synchronous writes tend to be slow</h2>

<p>
I have attached to this post a very simple Java program, that will give
a crude approximation of the speed at which a disk file can be
written, synchronously and asynchronously. The code listing shows
how to run the program.
</p>
<p>
For illustration, here are some results, obtained from the Lenovo laptops
on my desk. These are not, of course, enterprise-class servers, so the 
actual numbers are not that important. I want to draw attention to the
difference between the synchronous and asynchronous performance.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
Local SSD:
async: 54 msec, 18518 writes/sec
sync: 4618 msec, 216 writes/sec

SSD via NFS (local gigabit network):
async: 71 msec, 14084 writes/sec
sync: 5005 msec, 199 writes/sec

USB3 memory stick:
async: 45 msec, 22222 writes/sec
sync: 4554 msec, 219 writes/sec

tmpfs (filesystem in RAM):
async: 48 msec, 20833 writes/sec
sync: 49 msec, 20408 writes/sec
</pre>

<p>
Notice that, other than the in-memory filesystem (<code>tmpfs</code>),
every test shows a huge, order-of-magnitude
difference between synchronous and asynchronous
write performance. Why? It's because synchronous writes
<i>disable all buffering and caching in the operating system</i>. 
This limitation does not apply, to any great extent, to the in-memory 
filesystem. Updates to this kind of filesystem do not have to pass
through any specific hardware -- they are just RAM writes. As an
aside, I'll point out that the <i>asynchronous</i> write speeds are
all broadly the same (NFS is, perhaps, a little slower). This 
suggests that asynchronous write performance is not limited
much by disk hardware. That's as we ought to expect: an asynchronous
write is purely an in-memory operation; the disk hardware will only
be updated periodically.
</p>

<p>
Notice that the use of the networked NFS does not significanly affect
synchronous write performance: the overheads involved in the NFS
protocol -- at least with a fast network -- are much less significant
than the need to write to disk without buffering. 
</p>

<p>
It's worth bearing in mind that operating system settings can force
disk operations to be synchronous when the application asks for them
to be asynchronous, or vice versa. For example, when I run my
test program against an NFS mount that has the <code>sync</code>
option (<code>mount -o sync...</code>), I see this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
SSD via NFS, with '-o sync': 
async: 5090 msec, 196 writes/sec
sync: 5147 msec, 194 writes/sec
</pre>

<p>
Notice that the asynchronous performance has been reduced to the same
as the synchronous performance because, in fact, all writes are now
synchronous. Whether this will affect a message broker -- which 
will typically make all journal writes synchronous anyway -- is
something I'll touch on later.
</p>

<p>
I've also noticed -- to my consternation -- that some Linux RAID systems
ignore synchronous write instructions completely, and buffer 
data within the RAID system. This gives a misleading sense of 
security to the broker, although it makes writes look faster. There was
a bug in certain Linux kernels a few years ago (this affected some
releases of Red Hat RHEL 6, but probably many other systems, too) that had
the same effect -- all writes were actually asynchronous. The moral
of this sad story is: if your synchronous write speed appears to be
too good to be true, it probably is. 
</p>

<h2>Synchronous writes can sometimes be combined</h2>
<p>
Given that synchronous writes are so slow, broker designers may try to
combine them. Apache ActiveMQ does not take this approach -- every
journal update is synchronous -- but Apache Artemis does.
</p>
<p>
Because the broker's clients can only be notified of success when their
data has been written synchronously, it's only helpful to combine
writes for mutliple, concurrent clients. Trying to group writes for a
single client will usually fail, because the client will 
expect to be
notified of success or failure after each message it produces or consumers. 
However, if
a number of clients  have sent or consumed a message, the broker can
perform a single synchronous flush for this whole group of clients.  
</p>
<p>
Implementing this strategy safely is very difficult and, in my experience,
it only improves throughput in a limited range of cases. Moreover, I
have not found any way to predict whether grouped synchronous writes
will be effective expect by testing with real application workloads.
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>"Asynchronous I/O" in Apache Artemis describes the way in which the broker interacts with the kernel. Enabling this mode of operation does not affect synchronization, as I use the term in this article.</blockquote>

<h2>Synchronous writing is not a panacea</h2>
<p>
For the sake of completeness, I will point out that using synchronous
writes -- even for every journal update -- does not completely eliminate
the risk of data loss in a failure. The application program (the message
broker, in this case) can tell the operating system that it should flush
the data to disk immediately, but it can't force it to do so. 
Moreover, even the
operating system can't force the drive hardware to flush its writes in
a particular way. Still, using synchronous writes reduces the 
time window in which data will be uncertain, from seconds to milliseconds.
</p>


<h2>Not everything needs to be synchronous</h2>

<p>
As we've seen, in order to reduce the risk of data loss, the broker will
write its journal files synchronously, which is about ten times slower
than asynchronous writes would be. However, journals are not the only files that
a broker will write. The broker will usually maintain index files, containing
a summary of the state of the broker at a particular time. There may 
also be transaction logs.  
</p>

<p>
In general, indexes do not need to be written synchronously. The reason is
that, after a failure, the broker will be able to reconstruct the index
from the journal. This may be a time-consuming process, but it only 
has to be done once at start-up; making the index update synchronous will
have an effect on every update thereafter.
</p>

<p>
Broker designers are aware of what needs to be synchronous and what does
not. That's why it's usually a bad idea to tell the operating system to
make all writes synchronous (e.g., by using the <code>sync</code> mount
option I described earlier). <i>But</i> using the <code>sync</code> option
may be essential if the operating system can't be trusted to write
synchronously when it is told to; I gave a couple of examples of such
misbehaviour earlier.
</p>

<p>
It's also worth thinking about <i>exactly</i> what has to be written
synchronously. The journal file contents, for sure; but what about
meta-data? Does it matter whether, for example, the file modification
timestamp is written synchronously? It probably does not, because the
broker won't actually use this information. So some brokers provide
some control over what is actually written synchronously to a journal
file. 
</p>

<p>
In practice, this control will be coarse-grained. Linux/Unix only 
offers two system calls to flush to disk: <code>fsync()</code>,
which flushes everything, and <code>fdatasync()</code> which flushes
only the file contents, and no metadata.  
</p>

<p>
In Java, the relevant API call is <code>FileChannel.force ()</code>.
This takes a boolean argument which indicates whether metadata is to be
flushed as well. The Java API call gives the impression that file data
can be flushed at the level of individual files. In Unix/Linux, this is
a misleading impression-- only the entire 
disk system can be flushed. It's worth thinking
about this when running a message broker on a system that is hosting other
disk-intensive processes: every time the broker flushes its journals to
disk, all other disk updates will be flushed as well, whether required
or not. With networked storage, it is even harder to guarantee that the
broker is not sharing disk bandwidth with other processes.
</p>


<h2>Some general recommendations</h2>

<p>
1. Don't put broker journals on a disk that is mounted with a
specific "synchronous" flag, unless you absolutely need to do this,
to work around a platform bug. If you must do this, see if you can configure
the broker to write inessential files in a separate, non-synchronous
location. 
</p>
<p>
2. If the broker can be configured to write journals without flushing
metadata, consider using this configuration. In my experience, 
avoiding metadata flushes usually gives a small, but consistent,
improvement in broker throughput.
</p>
<p>
3. If possible, avoid sharing the broker's disk storage with other
processes that write a lot of data to disk. When the broker flushes
its journal updates to disk, almost certainly all other updates will
be flushed along with them.
</p>
<p>
4. Don't use persistent messaging for queues that actually don't require
it. The best disk throughput comes from not writing to disk at all.
Of course, many broker operations <i>will</i> require that data be
stored; but don't fall into the trap of assuming that, 
because some message data
needs to be stored, the broker might as well store every message.
This, of course, is a matter of system design, not just broker configuration.
</p>
<p>
5. If your message broker allows synchronous writes to be grouped and flushed
in batches, it's worth testing to see if this improves performance. 
However, sometimes it reduces throughput, rather than increasing it,
and there's no easy way to figure out how effective it will be, other
than by testing.
