<h1>Does the use of custom Android ROMs improve or worsen security?</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/lineage_logo.png" 
  alt="logo"/>
In <a href="degoogle.html">another article</a> I described my experiments
with removing Google, and other organizations that profit from
the surveillance economy, from my life. Part of that process was 
replacing the vendor's Android on my smartphone and tablets
with a 'custom ROM' -- in my case Lineage OS. Lineage is based
on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and is itself open source.
In addition, I run only open-source apps on my devices now.
</p>
<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>The term 'custom ROM' is a misnomer, of course -- no actual ROM is involved. I use it, with reluctance, to refer to a non-vendor operating system installation, because everybody else does.</blockquote>
<p>
My cellphone and tablets contain sensitive data. Some of it this
has obvious significance -- confidential documents and such-like
-- but I also have
stored credentials and passwords, cached by apps. 
</p>
<p>
It's reasonable to ask, I think, whether installing a custom ROM improves
the security of my devices, or reduces it. 
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>In this article I'm only considering the security implications of using a custom ROM. My related decision to use only open-source apps also has security implications, but I won't be discussing this point further.</blockquote>

<h2>Why is there a problem?</h2>
<p>
Let's start with the obvious one: there's no way to ensure that
the custom ROM is itself trustworthy. If you download an 
operating system image, it could
literally contain <i>anything</i>. Can you be sure there aren't secret
key-loggers embedded in the code, for example?
</p>
<p>
It seems to me that the only way to exercise any level of 
control here is to
use custom ROMs that are open source, created by people or organizations
with a long record of good behaviour. Ideally, you would build the
ROM from the source code yourself, although this is often a complex,
time-consuming process. 
</p>
<p>
There's no way to be sure that the ROM is entirely free of 
nasties. The reason that this isn't a knock-down argument against
using custom ROMs is that <i>some commercial Android versions
are also compromised</i>. To be fair, this is a
problem that mostly affects low-cost, unbranded devices. Still,
buying a device with Android pre-installed does not guarantee
that it is trustworthy.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, many Android devices come with a stack of pre-installed
software, the security implications of which are hard to assess. This 
software is often not written by the device vendor, but has been
installed as some kind of partnership arrangement. Many 
Android apps have a reputation for plundering user data and doing
unknown things with it. Ironically, the pre-installed Android
from a reputable device vendor seems <i>more</i> likely to have
problems of this sort than a reputable custom ROM. Samsung has an
ill reputation for bloatware of dubious provenance, but
Android versions produced by network operators are probably
the worst culprits.
</p>
<p>
The more subtle problem with custom ROMs, which will 
occupy most of this article, is that installation requires 
disabling some fundamental software protections.
</p>

<h2>The vexed question of unlocking the bootloader</h2>
<p>
Installing a custom ROM requires unlocking the bootloader of a 
device. An unlocked bootloader will allow a kernel and supporting
binaries to run, that do not match the vendor's cryptographic
hashes. In the usual, locked state, Android will check the
cryptographic hash of the boot partition of the internal storage
against the vendor's stored value. If the hashes do not match,
it will interrupt the boot process.
</p>
<p>
While a vendor's implementation of Android may have 
problems of the kind I suggested above, at least it's a known quantity.
The vendor's bootloader
check limits the device to running code that the vendor has
tested and is prepared to support, for whatever that's worth.
</p>
<p>
Unlocking the bootloader amounts, more-or-less, to disabling this
check. It's a necessary first step in installing a custom ROM on
almost any modern Android device, and 
it's usually a 
one-way operation. The bootloader cannot safely be relocked,
because the custom boot partition will not have cryptographic
hashes that match the vendor's stored values. So even attempting to
relock the bootloader will usually make the device inoperable. There
are just a few devices that do allow this limitation to be
circumvented but, even in these cases, relocking the bootloader will
not make the device look to apps as if it is running vendor
firmware. So most users who unlock the bootloader to install
custom ROMs do not re-lock, even on those rare devices where it 
is possible to do so.
</p>

<p>
Are there additional hazards that arise
from running a device that has an unlocked bootloader?
</p>

<p>
The simple answer is: yes.
</p>

<p>
The longer answer is that it is very unlikely that running
an unlocked bootloader will be a security hazard <i>on its own</i>,
except in well-defined circumstances that I will discuss.
More significant problems potentially arise when other 
vulnerabilities are present, along
with the unlocked bootloader.
</p>

<p>
Most modern ROMs based on the AOSP use file-based encryption (FBE)
by default. For those that do not, encryption can usually be
enabled after installation (but see below).
</p>
<p>
Enabling FBE means that if you lose physical custody of the device, and
an intruder is able to install new boot-time code (or just
use a debug interface in your existing boot-time code), none of the
user data will be accessible. The intruder would still have to 
find some way to decrypt this data. The decryption keys for
FBE are linked to the user PIN (which, of course, needs to be
hard to guess, and not just for this reason). 
</p>

<p>
But what if an intruder was able to insert something into your
existing Android installation, that just intercepted the PIN when
you entered it? If the intruder has the PIN and can
(again) get physical access to the device, security is completely
compromised.  
</p>

<p>
Or perhaps the intruder could modify Android in such a way as to
circumvent the permissions that prevent one app interfering with
the files of another app. This opens the possibility of a malicious
app -- perhaps installed at the same time as the intrusion 
-- simply reading other apps'
data, and sending it somewhere.
</p>

<p>
Another possibility might be to insert something that modifies
the vendor's PIN screen, to reduce the time between repeated attempts
to guess a PIN. Then a brute-force PIN-guessing program (more
on this later) might 
be able to succeed in seconds rather than days.
</p>

<p>
I'm not suggesting for a moment that either of these hacks is
<i>easy</i>. There may actually be easier ways to compromise a 
device with an unlocked bootloader that I don't know about, 
but I'm reasonably sure that none will
be easy. The problem is that the world is full of smart, devious people
with too much time on their hands; the fact that something is 
difficult -- even extremely difficult -- won't prevent somebody
doing it eventually.
</p>

<h2>What about custom ROMs that don't support data encryption?</h2>
<p>
Modern versions of Lineage OS support FBE, and enable it by 
default. Earlier versions, and other custom ROMs, might either
not support it, or not enable it. Some older versions of Lineage OS
purport to support FBE, but fail to enable it when requested
(this is the case with my old NIDIA Shield tablet). 
</p>
<p>
In such a case, having an unlocked bootloader exposes all the
stored user data to a knowledgeable intruder who has physical
access to the device. No PIN is required.
</p>

<h2>Unlocked bootloader, malware, and bugs</h2>
<p>
Unlocking the bootloader might create security risks of its own
although, with encryption enabled, exploiting those risks will be
difficult. 
</p>
<p>
A bigger problem, perhaps, is the risk created when an unlocked
bootloader combines with other security weaknesses. These
weaknesses could be the result of deliberate insertion of malware, or just
innocent defects in Android. Suppose, for example, that someone was able
to exploit a weakness that provided write access to 
arbitrary files. This would be bad enough by itself but,
combined with an unlocked bootloader, such an exploit
could be used to insert further malware that would survive
a full data wipe.  
</p>
<p>
In the end, we don't actually <i>know</i> what potential exploits 
might be discovered in future. Unlocking the bootloader won't 
necessarily make these exploits more likely, but it will certainly
increase their potential for long-term nastiness. And there
<i>might</i> be vulnerabilities that are exploitable with an unlocked
bootloader, that we haven't discovered yet.
</p>

<h2>What about old devices?</h2>
<p>
The sheer volume of Android devices in the world creates a 
vast attack surface. New vulnerabilities are discovered regularly;
they necessitate updates to the Android platform and even, in some
cases, to the Linux kernel. 
</p>
<p>
Device manufacturers typically issue updates for a couple
of years, or until the next model is released. For popular
Android devices, enthusiasts may
continue to issue updated custom ROMs for a lot longer than this. 
</p>
<p>
Whether the potential removal of vulnerabilities in an
updated custom ROM offsets the 
problems inherent in an unlocked bootloader is something that is
hard to assess.
</p>

<h2>How important is your data, anyway?</h2>
<p>
None of the potential problems I've described need
concern a person who never stores, or enters, any private data
into an Android device. I use my Shield K1 tablet mostly for playing
locally-stored video and music files. That I can't encrypt this
device is not a concern to me, as an intruder would gain nothing
from it, even with physical access. 
</p>
<p>
With my smartphone, I've mostly stopped allowing apps
(particularly the web browser) to store credentials. There are no
stored website passwords that an intruder could steal. I do, however,
have credentials stored in my email client, because it's such a 
nuisance to enter these every time I want to look at my email.
A person who could get access to my email account could wreak
havoc with my life.  
</p>
<p>
I think that the use of encryption ensures that an
unlocked bootloader does not make this more of a risk than it
would otherwise be. Without encryption, I would be concerned.
</p>
<p>
In the end, only the owner of the device can really determine whether
the information stored on it requires protection. However, it's
worth remembering that many apps will store credentials.
It isn't just documents on a device that are at risk -- anything protected
by stored credentials, anywhere, is at risk if those credentials
are exposed.
</p>

<h2>But how big a problem is it, really?</h2>
<p>
Nearly all the problems associated with the use of a custom ROM
-- apart from those that might result from a ROM that is itself malicious
-- will be mitigated by maintaining physical custody of the device.
There is a whole class of 'evil maid' attacks, that gets its name
from peoples' willingness to leave cellphones unattended in hotel
rooms. I generally assume that, if somebody steals my
cellphone with a determined intent to crack it, he will succeed
in the end, whatever the state of the bootloader.
</p>
<p>
Many people use four-digit PINs for security. There are "only"
10,000 potential PINs. That sounds a lot, but bear in mind that
most Android devices allow a PIN to be entered by a keyboard
-- and a keyboard can be simulated using a computer. Code for
running a brute-force PIN attach by issuing keyboard codes is
widely available. 
</p>
<p>
Even without such code, trying 10,000 potential PINs manually
won't take all that long -- perhaps a few days. If somebody is
willing to brute-force your PIN, it won't matter at all whether
your bootloader is locked or not. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps surprisingly, fingerprint security might be even weaker
than a PIN. An episode of <i>MythBusters</i> showed just how
easy it is to lift a fingerprint from a drinking glass, and
print it in such a way that a cellphone would accept it.
If this isn't frightening, it should be.
</p>
<p>
Of course, if somebody does steal your phone or tablet, it's
probably going to be wiped and sold in the pub. Only a very
determined intruder will be trying to crack the device for
sinister purposes. For most of us, our main protection is that
our data is not valuable enough for anybody to allocate
significant resources to stealing it.
</p>

<h2>Using a smartphone is inherently risky</h2>
<p>
The sad fact is that smartphones are a privacy risk, and it really
isn't clear whether using a custom ROM makes that risk smaller
or greater.
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, using a custom ROM probably removes the low-grade
risks associated with pre-installed vendor apps. I'm fairly
sure that nothing in a basic Lineage OS install is reading my
contact list and calendar, and sending them to an advertiser 
-- something I can't
guarantee with the stock Android from Samsung. I don't even really
know what Samsung does with the data it collects. 
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, weakening boot-time security does make maintaining
physical custody of my devices even more pressing that it normally
is. And I suspect that most people don't even realize how important
that is.
</p>
<p>
On balance, my assessment is that using a custom ROM (that supports 
encryption) does not expose me to any significant <i>additional</i>
risk. However, there's no doubt that, for some people in some
situations, the added risk is present. Were I in such a situation,
I think I would avoid using a smartphone altogether, rather than
wonder whether a vendor ROM or a custom ROM is the lesser evil.
