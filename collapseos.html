<h1>Is Collapse OS really a practical proposition?</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/terminal.png" 
  alt="terminal prompt"/>
I must start by saying that I have nothing but respect for 
Virgil Dupras and the folks behind the
<a target="_blank" href="http://collapseos.org">Collapse OS</a> project. 
Fundamentally,
we all have the same concerns: the modern computing industry
is too complex and non-sustainable, and crucial skills needed to
work with simpler computing systems are being lost. The attrition of
engineers with <a href="cpm40.html">low level programming skills</a> and
<a href="amateurradio.html">low-level electronics skills</a> are things
I have commented on before.
</p>
<p>
What Collapse OS purports to be is an operating system that can run on
scavenged computer parts, based on 1980s technology. It primarily
focuses on Z80/8080 hardware. There is also a related project
<a target="_blank" href="http://duskos.org/">Dusk OS</a>
which seems to be doing something similar with old PC hardware. 
Dusk OS seems to have rather different goals, and I won't be discussing
it further here.
</p>

<p>
Building an operating system for a computer made of scavenged parts
seems like a fascinating retrocomputing project to me. It's exactly
the kind of thing I'm interested in. But Collapse OS isn't positioned
as a retrocomputing project -- it purports to be a practical way
to create rudimentary computers after our technological society has
collapsed. I don't deny that such a collapse is possible -- it's
certainly happened before. That we might, in such an event, have 
bigger things to worry about than playing <i>Zork</i> is something
the Collapse OS folks acknowledge. The key point, if I understand correctly,
is that having access to workable computers -- even simple ones --
would give us a survival advantage.
</p>

<p>
Even allowing that computers would be helpful post-apocalypse, I am
far from convinced that a practical computer could be made from
scavenged parts, and the absence of an operating system is not the 
main reason why that is so.
</p>

<p>
Let's suppose you manage to scavenge the bare bones of a Z80-based computer,
from an old games console or cash register. 
These things were built to last and are electrically simple;
there's a good chance of finding working parts, and soldering-iron
repairs are practicable. Let's suppose
also that you have a way to power the device, and a way to solder and make
electrical connections, and a safe place to work, and no immediate
threats to survival (and none of these suppositions are entirely trivial).
</p>

<p>
Now what? You have the guts of a computer, with no general-purpose 
input or output devices,
and no storage. The original equipment -- whatever it was -- probably
booted from ROM. If it was sophisticated -- something that once ran
CP/M, for example -- the ROM would have loaded some code from a floppy
disk into memory, and then executed that. Probably most of the low-level
I/O control was in the ROM, because that functionality 
would have been device-specific.
</p>

<p>
In our post-apocalyptic state, can we burn a ROM? Or even an EEPROM?
The equipment may still exist, but it will need to be operated by
-- a computer. This is the main, chicken-and-egg problem I see here: 
we need a computer
to build a computer. But let's suppose that we're in a state where
we have a way to burn an EEPROM but no other computers apart from what
we can build with our own hands. I can't imagine what sequence 
of events would leave us
here but, to be fair, who knows what the apocalypse will bring?
</p>

<p>
So what about I/O? A general-purpose computer needs some sort of input
and output device. We could (presumably) scavenge keyboards and LCD 
displays from the same places we scavenged our Z80. The ubiquitous 
16x2 dot-matrix
LCDs are probably going to linger for millennia -- almost every electronic
appliance for thirty years had one, and they're indestructible. They are
comparatively easy to program, and the data sheet is widely available
on -- oh, wait, no Web. But you could make some sort of display device
from old seven-segment displays scavenged from clocks -- very early
microcomputers had no better displays than this.  
</p>

<p>
But how do we enter the code that will drive our I/O devices, 
given that we have -- at present -- 
no I/O devices? I guess that, if we have a way to burn an EEPROM --
assuming the highly speculative state of affairs to which I alluded
earlier -- perhaps we could do this by a process of trial and error:
burn the EEPROM, test it, burn it again... until we have at least a way
to read a keyboard (and this is easy, because it's just a switch matrix)
and write an LED display of some sort.
</p>

<p>
Assuming we can get past that stage -- and I have no idea how -- what
will our hacked-up computer use for storage? Not just storage for the
operating system itself -- conceivably that could be in ROM -- but
storage for whatever applications we run.
There are plenty of junk hard
drives in the world, but SD cards are probably
a better bet -- if they survive the coronal mass ejection or
whatever got us to this state. That's true so long SD cards continue 
to support the old SPI protocol, which is increasingly in doubt.
Writing code (Z80 op-codes in hex, I guess) to operate the SPI interface is
probably just about tractable -- I've done this for the Raspberry Pi
Pico, so I know what's involved. This protocol is clocked, so it will
work with slow computing devices. I can't imagine what would be involved
in interfacing, say, a SATA SSD to a Z80. 
</p>

<p>
But how will we get the code for Collapse OS (presumably with modifications)
into the storage or ROM? At this stage, 
it looks as if typing it in as hexadecimal
is the only practicable approach. We can't rely on any computer-based storage
it might be available on. To be honest, I'm not sure we would be able to
rely on printed paper, either, but let's assume we have a way. 
In the early days of the Z80 I used to program directly in hex op-codes
using a keypad -- that's not totally out of the question. It wasn't unusual,
back in the day, to bootstrap a computer this way: we would enter a minimum
program needed to read a rudimentary operating system from, say, 
punched tape or cards.  Of course, we actually <i>had</i> the punched tape
or cards with the code on, and we had already used some other computer
to get it there -- the old chicken-and-egg again.
</p>

<p>
One key design feature of Collapse OS is <i>self hosting</i>. For an
operating system to be
<i>self-hosting</i> means that it can be maintained and developed using
<i>itself</i> as the platform. No operating system <i>starts</i> as
self-hosting: it's impossible -- I can't maintain Linux on Linux until
there actually is a Linux. Linux has been self-hosting for twenty
years or more; I presume that other operating systems are the same.
Self-hosting is, indeed, a crucial property for an operating system
that has to work in highly straightened circumstances. It takes a lot of
effort to make a system self-hosting, and it is to the credit of
the Collapse OS folks that they have managed this. 
</p>

<p>
Arguably, once you have <i>just one</i> computer up and running
Collapse OS, you can use it to port Collapse OS to other hardware.
My concern is whether it's possible to get <i>even one</i> computer
running it, given the constraints. Perhaps the expectation is that
one computer running Collapse OS will survive the apocalypse, and this
can be used to build others. But if we are to postulate such a thing,
why not postulate that a modern Linux workstation -- or at least a Raspberry
Pi -- will be available? With such a thing, we could easily build
an operating system (of our choice) for our scavenged hardware. 
<p/>

<p>
The elephant in the sitting room is that there are already
operating systems designed for 1980's Z80 hardware. The most well-known,
of course, is CP/M. There is a colossal amount of software for CP/M and,
while its legal status is rather uncertain, that's unlikely to be a
problem when we're living in mud huts again. 
<p/>

<p>
The Collapse OS team rejects 
CP/M as a valid operating system for a scavenged computer, and
I have mixed feelings about that.
On the one hand, CP/M was never really designed to be 
maintained <i>on CP/M</i>. 
Even now, whether CP/M can be self-hosting is not clear. As a minimum
there would need to be complete source code. While
<a target="_blank" 
href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/early-digital-research-cpm-source-code/">some original source has been released</a>, it's not particular comprehensible,
or up-to-date even by CP/M standards.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, there are 
contemporary, open-source equivalents of CP/M. It is almost certainly
possible to make these self-hosting. 
</p>

<p>
But would there be any point? The fact that there are many practical
applications for CP/M is only a relevant consideration if we actually
have access to them. We don't have print-outs of the source, or any
tools to build the source if we did. The binaries are distributed around
the cloud, and unlikely to be on any kind of storage device we would
be able to access from a post-apocalyptic computer.
</p>

<p>
So, despite what some sceptics have claimed, the existence of CP/M
(and similar) is not a knock-down argument against the
value of Collapse OS. My main reservation is that, in practice, I don't
think we
would be able to build a computer that runs Collapse OS -- or
<i>anything</i> without access to other computers. 
</p>

<p>
When we look at the real history of computer development, we can see that
even the crude-seeming Z80-based appliances of the 1980s are, in fact,
fabulously complex. They are an evolutionary step in the process that
started with ENIAC, and went through many stages of refinement before
we ended up with the Kaypros and RML 380z's, and the Apple IIs, and all the
rest of them. These devices were not hacked up in somebody's basement using
a multimeter and a soldering iron -- they were the product of a substantial
IT industry, that was already well developed. Z80 stuff only looks
primitive to us, because we have single-board computers clocked at
gigahertz with gigabytes of RAM.
</p>

<p>
I don't know if it's possible to short-circuit the development of the
microcomputer industry, and go straight from scavenged parts to a working
computer. The Collapse OS folks say -- and I have no reason to doubt --
that their code runs on the RC2014, TRS-80, Apple II, and others. 
That's fine as it goes -- but these are <i>complete computers</i>.
I might be able to make
a TRS-80 from scavenged parts of other TRS-80s, but I doubt I will be 
able to make one from old games consoles and burglar alarms. It
seems to be that there's a huge gap between 'runs on old computers' and
'runs on scavenged computer parts'. And I really don't know what will
fill that gap. 
</p>

<p>
It gives me no pleasure to write any of this. I think Collapse OS
is a valid project, in that it promotes simplicity and preserves
low-level programming skills. It's certainly interesting, and clever.
So what would it take to convince me that it could actually meet
its post-apocalyptic design goals?
</p>

<p>
What would convince me is for somebody to make it run on <i>any</i> 1980s Z80
system <i>without</i> the use of any other complete, working computer. It would
need to be done as the project itself proposes: from scratch, in an environment
in which we assume that no other working computers exist.  I don't know whether
it's possible to do that even in theory, let alone in practice. 
</p>

<p>
A question remains whether Collapse OS is a better operating system than
CP/M <i>besides</i> its post-apocalyptic pretensions. I can certainly
think of theoretical reasons why it might be. But CP/M has a lot
of momentum, and a significant base of expertise even
now. Unfortunately, the population of CP/M experts is ageing;
 we're competing with the Grim Reaper here -- and that's
a competition we can't win. My concern is that the Grim Reaper may
end up taking everybody who knows how to solder or to program in assembly 
language, and then we could be in serious trouble, even without
an apocalypse.
