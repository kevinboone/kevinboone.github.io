<h1>Updating, building, and flashing RomWBW on an SC130 CP/M system</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/chip.png" 
  alt="Chip logo"/>
This article is one of my series 
<a href="rc2014.html">Adventures with RC2014, Z80, and CP/M</a>.
It describes how to update, rebuild, and install the RomWBW firmware
in the EEPROM on an SC130 board -- using Linux as the build platform.
The process should be similar for other boards that use RomWBW, 
particularly if -- like the SC130 -- they use a software-flashable
EEPROM. It's also similar on Windows and (I guess) other supported
platforms, but I'm only describing Linux. I don't have a hardware
EEPROM programmer, so I can't describe flashing the EEPROM that
way. I'll be using the CP/M <code>flash</code> utility that is
part of RomWBW.
</p>
<p>
RomWBW is the platform firmware for a number of Z80-based 
retro-style computers. It contains not only the CP/M BIOS, but also
images of CP/M itself (and other operating systems), and a 
disk image containing system utilities. In most cases, RomWBW
is used with 512 kB EEPROMs.
</p>
<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/><b>CAUTION</b> getting any part of this process wrong could leave you with a brick. There are various tests that can be carried out to reduce the likelihood, but it cannot be entirely excluded. Before proceeding, I advise ensuring that you have a way to obtain a functioning replacement EEPROM.</blockquote>

<h2>Why do this?</h2>
<p>
A common reason to rebuild RomWBW is to change the contents of the
system disk image -- to add new utilities, for example, or remove
unused ones. In this example, I will be changing the floppy disk
controller, which I will do by creating a new configuration file
based on the standard one for the SC130.
</p>
<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>Before making modifications to the ROM, it's perhaps worth running the build with an unmodified configuration, just to verify that the build and install processes are themselves working.</blockquote>


<h2>Obtaining the source</h2>

<p>
First obtain the RomWBW source. You can download and unpack
it or, more easily, clone the repository on GitHub:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ git clone https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW.git 
$ cd RomWBW
</pre>

<p>
Using <code>git</code> this way is useful (if you understand
<code>git</code>) because you can record and, perhaps, back out
changes that you make to the source.

<h2>Modifying the configuration</h2>
<p>
During the build, you'll be prompted for platform information. 
The prompts refer to configuration files in the directory
<code>Source/HBIOS/CONFIG</code>. My board is supported by
configuration files whose names begin <code>SCZ180</code>. I think
'SC' here is Stephen Cousins, the designer of the board, and Z180
is the CPU. 
</p>
<p>
In the directory are files for specific boards of the same class:
<code>SCZ180_sc130.asm</code>, <code>SCZ180_sc126.asm</code>, etc.
For the SC130 board, I will make a copy of the file 
<code>SCZ180_sc130.asm</code>, and call it <code>SCZ180_sc130_kb.asm</code>.
The name is not arbitrary -- it must begin with <code>SCZ180_</code>, 
or the build process won't see it.
</p>
<p>
My configuration change amounts to setting the floppy disk driver
in my newly-created configuration file, like this:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
FDMODE .SET FDMODE_EPFDC
</pre>
<p>
Of course, the specifics of the change are not important here.
</p>

<h2>Running the build</h2>
<p>
On Linux, I just do:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ make clean; make
</pre>

<p>
It takes a little while before we get to this prompt:
</p>


<pre class="codeblock">
Enter platform [ DYNO MBC MK4 N8 RCZ180 RCZ280 RCZ80 RPH SBC SCZ180 UNA ZETA ZETA2 ] : SCZ180
Enter config for  [ sc126 sc130 sc131 sc140 sc503 sc130_kb ] : sc130_kb
</pre>

<p>
Note that one of the choices in the list corresponds to the new configuration
file I created -- this is why the naming convention is important.
</p>

<h2>Testing the build</h2>
<p>
The outputs of the build process I am interested in are these two files:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ ls -l Binary/*kb*
-rw-rw-r--. 1 kevin kevin  40487 Jun 13 08:04 Binary/SCZ180_sc130_kb.com
-rw-rw-r--. 1 kevin kevin 524288 Jun 13 08:04 Binary/SCZ180_sc130_kb.rom
...
</pre>

<p>
The <code>.rom</code> file contains the new contents of the EEPROM. It is
exactly 512kB in size (this applies to nearly all the platforms that
RomWBW supports). The <code>.com</code> file is a CP/M program that
contains the executable part of the BIOS -- not the filesystem image and
platforms. The <code>.com</code> file is important because it allows
us to sanity-check the build before flashing the EEPROM. 
</p>

<p>
To run the test, use whatever method you favour to copy the <code>.com</code>
file to the CP/M system. You'll have to choose a new, shorter name, because
CP/M uses 8.3 file naming. So I have copied the file to drive F, name
<code>test.com</code>.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
B> f:
F> test
</pre>

<p>
This test runs the HBIOS ROM, but as if it were a CP/M program. It looks
as if the machine has rebooted, but you'll find that none of the 
commands to run operating systems work (because they are not part
of the <code>.com</code> file). If the system actually <i>has</i>
rebooted, then that indicates a problem. So it helps if the change
you're making is one that is quite obvious.
</p>

<p>
In my case, I've changed the floppy disk driver to EPFDC, and I'm 
looking for confirmation of this in the 'boot' messages.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
RomWBW HBIOS v3.2.1, 2023-06-13
...
MD: UNITS=2 ROMDISK=384KB RAMDISK=256KB
FD: MODE=EPFDC IO=0x48 NOT PRESENT
...
</pre>

<p>
So there is the change (and, in fact, the disk hardware is not
installed at this point, so NOT PRESENT is expected). At this point
we can have some confidence that the build succeeded, so now we
can flash the EEPROM.
</p>

<h2>Flashing the ROM</h2>
<p>
The SC130 has a software-flashable EEPROM, supported by the 
RomWBW <code>flash</code> utility. I understand that most boards that
support RomWBW are software-flashable. 
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>The SC130, and some other boards, have hardware write-protect jumpers that might need to be adjusted.</blockquote>

<p>
Copy the <code>.rom</code> file from the build to a suitable (real or
simulated) hard disk on the CP/M system. Again, you'll have to 
shorten the name. I have called it <code>test.rom</code>, on drive F.
</p>
<p>
Now simply use the <code>flash</code> utility to update the EEPROM:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
f> b:flash write test.rom
</pre>

<p>
This process takes a few minutes. Reset the system, and check the new
BIOS. 
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
Building and flashing RomWBW is surprisingly straightforward on my
Linux system. It's worth keeping in mind, however, that it 
could potentially break something. The <code>flash</code> utility
runs under CP/M so, as a minimum, the modified ROM has to be able
to boot CP/M, and have access to the <code>flash</code> utility
itself. I would not undertake the process without ensuring that you
have a way to recover, if it all goes horribly wrong.
