<h1>Using Keycloak for authentication with Apache Artemis: part 1</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/keycloak-logo-small.png" 
  alt="Keycloak logo"/>
This article describes what I believe is a minimal set-up of the Artemis
message broker, to use the Keycloak authentication server for access
control. The article covers the authentication of both messaging (JMS) clients
and users of the broker's administration console -- in fact, in this
trivial example, they are the same users.
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>I wrote this article for Keycloak 18.0, which was based on the Wildfly application server. Newer versions are based on Quarkus but, perhaps surprisingly, basic administration is similar. However, when I tested this article on Keycloak 24.0, I found that I had to do a few things differently. It's plausible that the steps I found I needed, I actually needed for 18.0, but forgot to document. If so, I apologise. Please see the end of this article for what's different in 24.0</blockquote>

<p>
I will describe the set-up of Keycloak and Artemis from scratch, on
bare metal. This example uses 'direct access grants' for authenticating
JMS clients. This means that the JMS client will present a user ID and
password to the Artemis broker, and Artemis will authenticate these
credentials against Keycloak. In the 
 <a href="artemis_keycloak_2.html">next article</a> I describe an authentication
scheme in which a JMS client gets a short-lived 'bearer' token from
Keycloak, and passes that to Artemis. This is a more modern way of doing
authentication, although the need to fetch a token makes it less common
in machine-to-machine interactions.
</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>
This minimal set-up is only intended to serve as a starting point, and
has a number of important limitations.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Keycloak and Artemis are on the same, local host (but this is easy to change)
</p></li>
<li><p>
No SSL/TLS is used anywhere -- all communication is plaintext
</p></li>
<li><p>
The same users and roles are defined for both messaging clients, and
users of the web-based administration console
</p></li>
<li><p>
I'm not going to attempt to describe any of the authentication protocols,
or even give low-level details of the set-up: to be frank, I lack the
expertise to do so
</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Installing and setting up Keycloak</h2>

<p>
1. <a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/releases/download/18.0.0/keycloak-legacy-18.0.0.zip" target="_blank">Obtain the Keycloak bundle.</a> I'm
using version 18.0 -- the "legacy" version that is based on Wildfly. Newer
versions will be based on Quarkus, but they should work in a very similar way
-- at least in simple applications.
</p>

<p>
2. Unpack the bundle and start the server by running 
<code>bin/standalone.sh</code> or <code>bin\standalone.bat</code>.
</p>

<p>
3. Open the Keycloak administration console using a web browser -- it
uses port 8080 by default.
</p>

<p>
4. Enter an initial administrator password when prompted.
</p>

<p>
5. From the realm name drop-down list at the top left, select "Add realm".
Call the new realm "foo", or choose a more imaginative name -- but note that
the name will appear in later configuration, and I have assumed
"foo" in what follows.
</p>

<p>
6. From the left-hand side-bar menu select "Clients", and add
client "artemis-broker". This name will be used in other parts of the
Keycloak configuration, and also by messaging clients when they authenticate.
If not changed, the authentication
protocol for this client will be OpenID Connect (an extension of OAuth 2.0).
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>The term "Client" in Keycloak denotes one or more applications with related authentication requirements; Keycloak itself is not acting as a client in a client/server interaction.</blockquote> 

<p>
7. In the configuration page for the "artemis-broker" client,
select the "Roles" tab, and
add an "amq" role. No specific configuration is needed for the role, nor
any other configuration for the client. "amq" is the name used in Artemis,
by default, for a "superuser" role -- a user that has access to all 
message queues and to the administration console. Of course, in practice,
we would be creating multiple roles with different users.
</p>

<p>
8. Select "Users" from the left-hand side-bar menu, and create a new user.
I'm using "user1".
In the "Credentials" tab for the new user, fill in the password (and
configuration) and click "Reset Password".
</p>

<p>
9. In the "Role Mappings" tab for the user, do not select any realm
roles. Instead, select "artemis-broker" under "Client Roles"
and add the client role "amq" (it should be the only available selection).
</p>

<p>
The new user should look like this, in the Keycloak console:
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/keycloak-screenshot-user1.png" width="650px" alt="Screenshot of Keyclock console">
</p>

<p>
This completes the Keycloak set-up. We have created an authentication role
with one "client", one client role "amq", and one user "user1" in that role.
The authentication URL, that clients will use, will be http://host:8080/auth", 
where "host" might
be "localhost" in a simple test, and that's what I will assume here.
You'll need this URL when setting up the authentication provider in
Artemis.
</p>

<h2>Installing and setting up Artemis</h2>

<p>
1. <a href="https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/download/" 
target="_blank">Obtain Apache Artemis</a>
I'm testing using the May 5 build; the Red Hat productised version,
AMQ 7.9, also works fine.
</p>

<p>
2. Unpack the distribution, and create a new broker instance by
running <code>bin/artemis create foo</code>. Again, choose a 
more imaginative name than "foo" if you prefer. Answer the questions
about administrator IDs, but bear in mind that the answers will not
be used, as we will be overwriting the log-in configuration files.
</p>

<p>
Don't make any changes to <code>etc/broker.xml</code> -- the stock
configuration creates one user role "amq" with all access to everything.
That is sufficient for basic testing.
</p>

<p>
3. Create the file <code>etc/keycloak.json</code>, which will be used
by the Keycloak log-in module in Artemis.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"  style="overflow-x:scroll">
{
  "realm": "foo",
  "resource": "artemis-broker",
  "auth-server-url": "http://localhost:8080/auth",
  "use-resource-role-mappings": true,
  "principal-attribute": "preferred_username",
  "ssl-required": "external",
  "credentials": {
    "secret": "foo"
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
In this configuration, "resource" denotes the Keycloak "client" we created
earlier. The "secret" value is arbitrary -- it will be used in the 
OAuth challenge, but is not actually check with the current configuration.
See below for more on this subject.
</p>

<p>
4. Edit etc/login.config in the broker instance directory, so that it
looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock" style="overflow-x:scroll">
activemq {
    org.keycloak.adapters.jaas.DirectAccessGrantsLoginModule required
      keycloak-config-file="${artemis.instance}/etc/keycloak.json"
      role-principal-class=org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.RolePrincipal
    ;
    org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.PrincipalConversionLoginModule required
      principalClassList=org.keycloak.KeycloakPrincipal
    ;
};

</pre>

<p>
Note that this file references the <code>keycloak.json</code> created
earlier. The JAAS realm name "activemq" is a predefined, default name. 
Artemis can use different JAAS realms for different subsystems, and it 
will usually be appropriate
to do so -- see below. In this trivial example, however, all authentication
will use the same settings.
</p>

<p>
5. Start the Artemis broker (<code>bin/artemis run</code>). Look for a 
message in the log similar to the following:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"  style="overflow-x:scroll">
2022-05-24 14:11:07,937 INFO  [io.hawt.web.auth.AuthenticationConfiguration]
Starting hawtio authentication filter, JAAS realm: "activemq" authorized
role(s): "amq" role principal classes:
"org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.RolePrincipal"
</pre>

<p>
6. Verify that you can log into the Artemis web console 
(<code>localhost:8161/console</code>) using the credentials user1/user1,
and no others.
</p>

<p>
7. To test that messaging clients are being authenticated correctly,
you can use the built-in <code>artemis</code> utility. For example:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"  style="overflow-x:scroll">
$ ./bin/artemis producer --user user1 --password user1
Connection brokerURL = tcp://localhost:61616
Producer ActiveMQQueue[TEST], thread=0 Started to calculate elapsed time ...
...
Producer ActiveMQQueue[TEST], thread=0 Elapsed time in milli second : 7022 milli seconds
</pre>

<h2>Extending the configuration</h2>

<p>
Configuring which users can do what on which message queues is not specifically
a Keycloak issue -- all that Keycloak does is supply the user roles; 
Artemis will use its own configuration (in <code>broker.xml</code>) to
decide whether an operation is allowed.
</p>

<p>
In this trivial example, I've used a single user to test both messaging
clients and administration -- this is unlikely to be a satisfactory
arrangement in practice. Artemis does not really have fine-grained control
of the console: if a user can access the console, that user can do
everything that the console allows. To grant access to the console only
to specific users, create a new "console" role (again, this is a "client"
role) in Keycloak, and assign that role to the relevant users. Then, to
configure Artemis to allow only that role to access to console, edit
<code>etc/artemis.profile</code> and change <code>HAWTIO_ROLE=amq</code>
to <code>HAWTIO_ROLE=console</code>. 
</p>

<p>
If you want to use a completely different authentication configuration
for the console -- not just a different role -- then you can create a
new JAAS realm in <code>login.config</code>. Set the Java system
property <code>hawtio.realm</code> to indicate the new realm.
This realm can reference completely different Keycloak configuration
files, if necessary.
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
It's not difficult to configure Artemis to use Keycloak for authentication
-- so long as the requirements are very simple. In this article,
I've presented what I believe to be the simplest possible, working
configuration. 
</p>
<p>
What I've described in this article is a "direct access" authentication
scheme. By that I mean that the client has no authentication user interface,
and just provides credentials that Keycloak checks. A client that has a
web interface will more usually redirect users to the Keycloak log-in
screen, and complete authentication that way, before being directed
back to the application. This requires a somewhat more complicated
set-up.
</p>
<p>
"Direct access" clients typically have an additional layer of
authentication, being asked to provide a "secret" value known to
Keycloak, as well as its regular credentials. A Keyclock client
has an "Access Type" setting that defaults to "public", meaning
that no secret value is required. Thus we were able to set the
secret to "foo" in the AMQ configuration. 
</p>
<p>
To assign a secret to a specific Keyclock client, set the Access Type
to "confidential", and then go to the "Credentials" page of the 
client. There you will be able to see, or edit, the secret value, which
can then be copied to the AMQ configuration.
</p>

Later versions of
Artemis contain an example,
 <code>examples/features/standard/security-keycloak/</code>,
that demonstrates a more complex set-up, in which messaging clients and
console administrators have completely different Keycloak configurations.
</p>

<h2>Addendum -- what I had to do differently in Keycloak 24.0</h2>
<p>
1. A few of the user interface elements are in slightly different places 
in the web console in 24.0. I hope these differences are slight, but it
might be necessary to hunt around in the UI a little, to find the 
settings I mention.
</p>

<p>
2. In 18.0, I configured AMQ to use the authentication URL
<code>/auth</code>. This doesn't work in 24.0, and you'll see
this error message in AMQ:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
WARN  [org.keycloak.adapters.jaas.DirectAccessGrantsLoginModule] Login failed. 
Invalid status: 404, OAuth2 error. Error: Unable to find matching target 
resource method, Error description: For more on this error consult the server 
log at the debug level.
</pre>

<p>
That's a genuine 404 error, because the URL <code>/auth</code> doesn't 
go anywhere. I found that I didn't need a path in the URL at all with
24.0, so in <code>keycloak.json</code> I have: 
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
  "auth-server-url": "http://localhost:8080/",
</pre>

<p>
What happens is that the keycloak adapter makes a request on 
<code>/realms/foo/.well-known/openid-configuration</code> to find the
OAuth endpoints, so we don't need to set one explicitly.
</p>

<p>
3. With 24.0 I found that I couldn't use a minimal user, with nothing
but a username and password. When I set this up, I got the following
error message in AMQ:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
WARN  [org.keycloak.adapters.jaas.DirectAccessGrantsLoginModule] Login failed. 
Invalid status: 400, OAuth2 error. Error: invalid_grant, Error description: 
Account is not fully set up
</pre>

<p>
I think the user needs at least a verified email address, or we need to
disable email verification completely. Since a direct grant user has no
user interface, we can't expect the user to verify the email address. 
In the settings page for the user, there is a checkbox for "Email verified".
However, that doesn't work on its own -- the user actually needs an
email address, even if it's a bogus one.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, select the 'Authentication' menu for the realm (leftmost
pane in the UI), Select the 'Required actions' tab, and turn off
'Verify Email'. Of course, this method affects all users.
