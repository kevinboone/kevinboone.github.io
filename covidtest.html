<h1>Why is covid-19 testing so unreliable? A pictorial view</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/coronavirus.png" 
  alt="coronavirus logo"/>

I guess that covid-19, and the coronavirus that causes it,
need no further introduction. After all, at the time of writing we're
living through the worst medical crisis -- in the western world, at least
-- in a century. As I write this, we're bracing ourselves for the winter
onslaught, and infections have already started to rise alarmingly.
</p>
<p>
Here in the UK, our Government's main approach to managing the disease 
is a program of widespread infection testing, followed by contact
tracing. It's worked pretty well elsewhere, and nobody wants to see
another national lock-down -- not after the ruinous effects of the
last one. 
</p>
<p>
The problem is that testing for covid-19 infection is staggeringly
unreliable. This lack of reliability  stems from the high rate of
false positives, and is usually explained mathematically.
Although the math isn't hard to understand, this article
illustrate the problem of false positives in pictures.
</p>

<h2>The problem of false positives</h2>

<p>
The effectiveness of a medical screening test is generally expressed
in terms of its <i>sensitivity</i> and <i>selectivity</i>. A
test is "sensitive" if a large proportion of people who are infected
test positive; it is "selective" if a small proportion of people who
are <i>not</i> infected test positive. These figures are usually 
expressed as proportions or percentages. An ideal test would provide 
100% sensitivity and 100% selectivity -- everybody with the disease
would test positive, and nobody without it would test positive. 
</p>
<p>
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test widely used for public testing
for the coronavirus in the UK has sensitivity and 
selectivity that are both around 95%. 
These are impressive figures, given the tiny amounts of virus
protein they have to detect. 
</p>
<p>
With a sensitivity of 95%, anybody who had a positive test would
be justified in feeling worried. Such a person might even 
think there was a 95%
probability he or she was infected. 
</p>
<p>
In fact, at the levels of incidence of the infection encountered in
the community at the time of writing, there is a much higher chance
that the positive test is a false positive, than that the subject
is actually infected. 
</p>
<p>
I should point out that I'm talking about widespread, community
testing, here -- not testing in hospitals or nursing homes. We expect
that, with such a testing regime,
 a large number of people tested are not sick or, at least,
not sick with covid-19. 
</p>
<p>
The relative contribution to a positive test caused by a genuine infection,
compared to a false positive, is easy to calculate mathematically.
However, it's more compelling as a 
diagram.
</p>

<h2>A graphical view</h2>

<p>
The image below represents the infection status of a 
town with 10,000 inhabitants.
I've picked this value to be a round number, not to represent any 
particular town -- the actual number isn't really important.
At the time of writing, the total rate of infection
is estimated to be about 1% in urban areas -- of course, it's higher
in some places than others but 1% is, again, a round number. I'll
consider later how the result below will change if that rate of
disease prevalence is different.
</p>

<br clear="all"/>
<img src="img/covidtest1.png" alt="Graphic" width="640"/>

<p>
Since the population is 10,000, with a 1% infection rate the total
number of infected people will be 100 -- that's the red area in the
graphic above.
</p>
<p>
The image isn't exactly to scale -- it's hard to draw a slice that is
only 1% of the total area. Still, it's clear how many more uninfected
people there are than infected people.
</p>
<p>
Now let's consider the covid-19 test, applied to the 100 people 
in the community who are,
for certain, infected. Because the sensitivity is 95%, the number of
infected people who test positive is 95 -- that's the new red area in
the graphic below.
The number of infected people who test negative is 5 -- the orange
area. That's an important figure in its own right, but not one I 
plan to consider further here. 
</p>

<br clear="all"/>
<img src="img/covidtest2.png" alt="Graphic" width="640"/>

<p>
Now let's consider people who are actually not infected.
There are -- assuming we test everybody -- 9900 of those people.
That's the green area above.
The selectivity is 95%, so the rate of false positives 
is 5%. The actual number of false positives is 5% of 9900, or 
495. The graphic below shows the final results for the four
sections into which the population is divided: people with the
disease who test positive (95), those with the disease who test
negative (5), those who are healthy and test negative (9405),
and the healthy who test positive (495). 
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<img src="img/covidtest3.png" alt="Graphic" width="640"/>
<p>
So far as the efficacy of testing is concerned, the relevant parts
of the diagram are the red and the blue regions. These represent
people who had a positive covid-19 test -- either because
they're infected (95 people), or because they had a false positive result
(495 people).
I hope the significance of
these two figures is clear: the uninfected group of positive-testers
is hugely larger
than the infected group. Why? Because the uninfected population
is hugely larger than the infected population.
</p>
<p>
The total number people who tested positive is 95 + 495 = 590.
So the percentage of people whom the test correctly identifies
as infected is 95 / 590 = <b>16%</b>.
</p>

<h2><i>What !?</i></h2>

<p>
There's an enormous disparity between the high sensitivity and selectivity
of the PCR test for covid-19 -- and the poor ability of the test to
identify people who are genuinely infected.
The reason for this is that even
the comparatively high selectivity rate of 95% does not prevent
false positives swamping real positives, when the overall incidence
of disease is low. 
The UK medical authorities -- and medical authorities everywhere
-- are keen to talk up the effectiveness of testing but, in my 
example, 495 people in a community of 10000 were wrongly identified
as being ill. If we made a rough guess that, on average, each of those
people lives in a household of three people, that's 1,485 people
in quarantine for 14 days. 
</p>
Let me just say that in a different way: <i>nearly 15% of the population
in quarantine, when only 1% are infected</i>.
<p>
</p>
<p>
It's reasonable to ask under what conditions widespread testing
<i>would</i> be efficacious. One measure is the point at which 
a positive result is as likely to indicate a genuine infection than
a false positive. Looking at the graph below, that point appears
to correspond to an overall infection incidence in the community
of about 5% (assuming specificity and selectivity both 95%).
</p>

<br clear="all"/>
<img src="img/covidtest4.png" alt="Graphic" width="640"/>

<p>
Putting this bluntly, until overall incidence reaches the shockingly
high level of 5%, you've got less than a coin-tossing chance of being infected
if you test positive. 
</p>
<p>
Hmmm....
</p>

<h2>So what should we make of this?</h2>

<p>
Throughout this article I've assumed that the Government's "test, test, test"
strategy implies to widespread community testing -- of people who are
healthy as well as those who appear to be ill. The Government seems to
have wavered in this commitment, and has recently started to 
hint that only people with symptoms should be tested. It's probably
fair to say that the chance of your positive test indicating a genuine
infection is increased if you actually have symptoms
of covid-19; but it's not clear how much it is increased.
</p>
<p>
More to the point, perhaps -- if you have obvious symptoms of covid-19,
perhaps you don't even <i>need</i> to be tested, To be sure, your symptoms
might come from  something else entirely -- but perhaps the people who
need to be tested are the ones you've been in contact with, and who
don't have symptoms. Even then, the rate of false negatives is likely to
be disruptively high. 
</p>
<p>
In short, unless the selectivity of covid-19 testing can be improved
radically, it would be a mistake to rely on widespread testing of
asymptomatic individuals to give us more information than tossing a coin.
