<h1>The planet Vulcan: a cautionary tale that deserves to be better known</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/telescope.jpg" 
  alt="Telescope"/>
The planet Vulcan was first allegedly sighted in 1859, having been proposed
to orbit the Sun inside the orbit of Mercury. Further sightings were
made over the next forty years or so. The properties of Vulcan
were described in detail, despite the fact that astronomers are now
firmly convinced that it does not exist. What actually <i>was</i>
sighted and attributed to Vulcan remains an open question.
</p>
<p>
That scientists were confident of something that later turned out to
be incorrect is hardly breaking news. After all, the inherent vulnerability
of scientific theories to falsification is largely what gives the 
scientific method its credibility.
However, the story of Vulcan is an cautionary one, providing a number of 
lessons that contemporary scientists and science
students would do well learn. 
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, this article is not about Mr Spock's home-world. Presumably,
the choice of the name Vulcan for this <i>other</i> fictional planet is
a coincidence. But it would nice to think it was intentional.
</p>


<h2>The birth of Vulcan</h2>
<p>
Our story starts in 1821, when French astronomer Alexis Bouvard published
detailed observations of the orbital behaviour of the planet Uranus, which 
had been discovered about fifty years previously. Almost immediately, 
astronomers who examined Bouvard's work realised that the
orbit of Uranus was not entirely in agreement with predictions made
by Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation. These laws were
were already solidly established, and considered to be more-or-less
unchallengeable at the time.
</p>
<p>
Over the next twenty years or so, Bouvard and other astronomers came to 
appreciate that
the anomalous orbit of Uranus could be explained if there were another,
as-yet unidentified planetary body exerting a gravitational influence on it.
Predicting the orbital path of such a body -- if, indeed, it even existed --
was a mathematical, rather than an astronomical,  problem  -- 
and an extremely difficult one. 
French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier is generally credited with
performing the calculations that allowed the new planet, now known
as Neptune, to be indentified. It was definitively observed in 1846, 
within one degree of the location that Le Verrier had predicted.
This was, and remains, a strikingly successful application of Newton's
mathematics to the modelling of planetary motion.
</p>
<p>
Whilst working on the mathematics of the orbit of Uranus, Le Verrier
also began studying the orbit of Mercury. He published a detailed
theory of the behaviour of Mercury, again based on Newton's laws,
in 1859. His results were a very close match to the observed
behaviour of the planet but, as had been the case for Uranus earlier,
not a perfect one. In particular, the precession of Mercury's
perihelion -- the variation in the point at which Mercury comes 
closest to the Sun --
was larger than predicted, by the vanishingly-small amount of
43 arc-seconds per century. That's about one ten-thousandth part of
a degree per year. 
</p>
<p>
Given the success of Le Verrier's theoretical work leading to the discovery
of Neptune, it's entirely understandable that he proposed a similar mechanism
to explain the behaviour of Mercury. Le Verrier gave the name Vulcan
to this putative planet, and astronomers immediately began looking
for it. 
</p>

<h2>The rise of Vulcan</h2>
<p>
Vulcan was "discovered" almost immediately. Le Verrier was officially 
recognized as the discoverer in 1860, although he did not make the 
confirmatory observations. The clincher -- or so it must have seemed to 
Le Verrier -- was an observation of Vulcan's transit of the Sun (that
is, the passage of the planet across the sun's disc).
However, even Le Verrier must have realized that this observation 
had been made in non-ideal conditions: a smallish telescope and
crude timekeeping equipment.
Still, over the next forty
years many sightings of Vulcan were published, some by reputable
astronomers working with state-of-the-art equipment. In particular,
respected US astronomers
James Craig Watson and Lewis Swift -- already credited with the 
discoveries of numerous
astronomical bodies -- both reported sightings of
Vulcan in 1878. Both men reported that Vulcan was red in colour, and appeared 
as a definite disc. This last point is highly significant because,
in principle, it rules out the mistaken observation of a star. Even in state-of-the-art modern telescopes, a star usually appears only as a point of light;
only bodies within our solar system are close enough appear as a disc.
</p>
<p>
In the end, at least twenty sightings of Vulcan were published by at
least ten astronomers with some standing. It seems probable that a huge
number of less reliable sightings were made as well. The consensus
in the astronomical community at the end of the nineteenth century
was almost certainly that Vulcan
existed, even if was observed only fleetingly.
</p>


<h2>The fall of Vulcan</h2>
<p>
It has to be admitted that the existence of Vulcan was somewhat contentious
right from the start. French astronomer Emmanuel Liais asserted that
he had been observing the Sun at the same time as Le Verrier's initial
reported transit, and with better equipment -- and he'd seen nothing. 
There's little doubt that some of the alleged transits were, in fact,
sunspots; and some of the reported bright objects just stars. 
</p>
<p>
Moreover, the various reported sightings did not always confirm
Le Verrier's mathematical model perfectly. He continued to adjust the parameters
of the model to accommodate all the sightings, but the agreement
with observation was never strikingly good. Nevertheless, Le Verrier
was able to publish detailed values for the radius of Vulcan's orbit
(about thirteen million miles), 
its period of revolution (about 20 days), and a number of other
orbital properties. 
</p>
<p>
It's probably fair to say that nobody now believes that there is
a planet with the properties that Le Verrier predicted, although
the existence of <i>some</i> planet within the orbit of Mercury
can't be ruled out. In fact, the International Astronomical Union 
has registered the name "Vulcan" for such a body, should one ever
be discovered.
</p>
<p>
In the end, though, it wasn't lack of evidence that killed Vulcan -- there
was plenty of evidence of its existence, from many different sources. 
Nor was imperfect agreement with Le Verrier's theory a fatal blow -- remember
that the measurements of Mercury's orbital parameters only
differed from Newtonian prediction by incredibly small amounts. Astronomers
were trying to work out from these tiny discrepancies the orbital
behaviour of a putative planet millions of miles away.
Perfect agreement with theory, or even perfect agreement between 
observations, could hardly have been expected, with the technology
available at the time.
</p>
<p>
Vulcan's nemesis turned out, in fact, to be Albert Einstein.
Einstein's model of gravitation, expressed in his general theory of 
relativity, simply offered a better explanation of
Mercury's orbit. Einstein did not need to appeal to a new planet to 
explain why Mercury's orbit took the form it did -- it was already perfectly
in line with his own predictions.
It's entirely possible that, without Einstein's contribution, we'd
still be looking for Vulcan today, and perhaps finding it.
</p>

<h2>So why is any of this important?</h2>
<p>
The tale of the rise and fall of Vulcan can be considered cautionary
for contemporary scientists, and science students, for at least
three reasons.
</p>
<p>
First, it illustrates the problems caused by refusing to accept that
a successful theory might be inadequate. Of course, we shouldn't reject
an effective theory on a whim, but we have to be ready to revise our
theoretical understanding in the light of new data. 
</p>
<p>
By the time Le Verrier published his observations of Mercury. Newton's
law of universal gravitation had been firmly established for nearly 
two hundred years. Together with his laws of motion, Newton's theory
of gravity was able to explain with great precision a huge range
of physical and astronomical phenomena. This was, of course, before
Einstein upset the gravitational apple-cart with his general theory
of relativity.
</p>
<p>
The long-term success of Newton's theory meant that, in the nineteenth
century, it's accuracy was essentially undisputed. This meant
that it was far more acceptable to propose an entire new planet 
-- a clear violation of Occam's razor -- than try to modify Newtonian
physics. 
</p>
<p>
The second -- somewhat related -- reason for caution that Vulcan 
highlights is a bit more subtle.
Just because a hypothesis adequately resolves theory and
observation on one occasion, that doesn't mean it will do so again,
even in similar circumstances.
In this case, the presence of Neptune was <i>successfully</i> invoked
to explain the orbit of Uranus. This actually strengthened scientists' 
confidence
in Newton's theory of gravity -- not that anybody really doubted it.
I think it's unlikely that Vulcan would have been proposed, had 
Le Verrier not made such a good call with Neptune. However,
with hindsight we can see that Le Verrier was over-confident here. 
Understandably so, of course -- Neptune had been a big win.
</p>
<p>
The third reason for caution is much simpler: Vulcan shows
only too clearly that, <b>when we look hard enough for something, we
tend to find it</b> -- whether it exists or not. It wouldn't be of
much interest 
if one or two crackpots had "found" Vulcan -- the disturbing fact is that 
a number of perfectly reputable astronomers and mathematicians found it,
when it was never actually there. How can that be? Presumably, the
explanation lies in a mixture
of wishful thinking, over-confidence, and sub-optimal experimental
methodology. 
</p>
<p>
It's commonplace in science for phenomena to be predicted before they
are observed. We frequently allow theory to guide our observations, and
it's proper to do so.  
After all, it's much easier to find something if you're
looking for it in roughly the right place. 
</p>
<p>
Consider just one of any number of examples from particle physics. 
The entity that we now call the Higgs boson was first proposed to exist
back in the 1960s. Such a particle had never been observed, and the 
technology of the day would have made observation very difficult --
ambiguous at best.
However, 
the Higgs was (and remains) necessary to explain certain features 
of the prevailing
model of subatomic physics. The Higgs <i>had</i> to exist -- if it did
not, then one of our most powerful scientific models would be 
cast into doubt. 
</p>
<p>
In fact, had we not found all the novel subatomic particles that our
theories predicted, unpalatable questions would have arisen
about the value for money of the colossally expensive equipment we
built to look for them (the Large Hadron Collider is 
the most expensive piece of scientific apparatus every constructed).
</p>
<p>
The Higgs particle was first detected back in 2012. It's been detected
many times since then, although agreement between measurement and
theoretical prediction of its properties is currently not perfect.  
</p>
<p>
Does any of this sound familiar at all?
</p>
<p>
For the avoidance of doubt, I should point out that I'm not proposing that
the Higgs boson doesn't exist. Increasing amounts of compelling observational
data suggests that it does. All I'm suggesting is that the story of
Vulcan should make us take a step back occasionally, and ask:
are we <i>sure</i> about this?
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
The story of Vulcan is not an edifying one, and none of the main actors
emerges with much credit. Key features of the history of
Vulcan are a hidebound, unquestioning
attitude to theory, and a willingness to accept sloppy, inconsistent
data as confirming that theory. Vulcan shows how
a dogged refusal to put observation ahead of theory leads to wasted
time and effort at best, and damage to the credibility of science
at worst. Most importantly, the story of Vulcan is a salutary reminder
that we tend to find what we're looking for, particularly when money
and reputation are at stake. Anybody who cares about the scientific 
endeavour should
think about Vulcan from time to time.
