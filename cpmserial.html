<h1>Serial device mapping in CP/M</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/terminal.png" 
  alt="terminal prompt"/>
This article is about how CP/M handled serial input/output. This is a complicated subject, 
but perhaps one that is not only of interest to retrocomputing enthusiasts. 
Comparing how modern operating
systems handle with serial devices with how CP/M did it can provide a useful insight into 
operating system design in general. 
</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>
Many serial devices existed in the CP/M days -- terminals, network connections, 
modems, tape storage devices, printers... most of these still exist. 
A well-behaved CP/M program would do I/O using functions in the CP/M BDOS (operating system).
BDOS would relay these function calls to the BIOS.
However many serial devices were connected to the computer, the CP/M BIOS provided an 
API (application program interface) for exactly four devices,
and no more. As an additional complication, only one of these devices was bidirectional.
So how could the CP/M system interact with more than four devices?
</p>


<h2>The CP/M 'logical' devices</h2>
<p>
The CP/M BIOS recognizes four logical devices. The term 'logical' denotes that they aren't
necessarily tightly bound to specific hardware. Here they are, in their entirety:
</p>

<p>
the CONSOLE device, usually referred to as 'CON:' in CP/M, which could be written or read;
</p>

<p>
the LIST device, usually referred to as 'LST:' in CP/M, which could only be written;
</p>

<p>
the PUNCH device, usually referred to as 'PUN:' in CP/M, which could only be written;
</p>

<p>
the READER device, usually referred to as 'RDR:' in CP/M, which could only be read. 
</p>

<p>
The original function of the CONSOLE device should be fairly clear -- it was nearly always associated
with the user terminal. LIST was traditionally a printer device, so it didn't need to be
read. PUNCH and READER originally referred to a paper tape writer and reader. Typically
these would have been different machines, so there are different devices with different
APIs. This is different from
the CONSOLE device -- it was assumed that reads and writes on the console device would go to the
same place. So some devices are bidirectional and some are unidirectional.
</p>

<p>
Of course, it's a long time since anybody seriously used paper tape for storage. The PUNCH
was already considered an 'auxiliary' device by the time CP/M was established. It might have
been assigned to a tape storage device, for example, or to a modem.  
</p>

<p>
The BIOS APIs that did input and output to these various devices were mirrored more-or-less
exactly in the CP/M BDOS. So there were BDOS functions to read and write the console, read and write
the 'punch', and write the list device. It's important to understand that there was no
<i>portable</i> way for an application to do serial I/O except to use the four standard
devices via their specific BDOS APIs. Hardware vendors might have provided extensions with more
flexibility, but portable software could not rely on this.
</p>

<h2>The 'physical' devices</h2>
<p>
Although the BIOS only provided APIs to write to the four standard logical devices 
(CONSOLE, LIST, READER, and PUNCH), it recognized additional devices, even though an application could not address them directly.
 These were typically referred to as 'physical' or 'hardware' devices, 
because the four logical devices could be mapped onto them in particular ways. Most vendors
recognized twelve of these
physical devices. For the record, they are known in CP/M as BAT, CRT, LPT, PTP, PTR, TTY, UC1, UL1, UP1, UP2, UR1, and UR2. It's hardly worth explaining what all of these names meant, because they were
archaic, and rarely corresponded to any recognized device. So, for example, 'UP' is
'user punch'. Having even one paper punch was unusual in the CP/M days; it seems highly unlikely
that any system would have had an <i>additional</i> punch device. 'CRT' (cathode ray tube) 
makes at least some kind of sense -- this name usually denoted the user console device. I will
explain some of the other names when they come up.
</p>

<p>
In practice, with the possible exception of CRT, the meanings of all the device names was
(and is) system-dependent.  Moreover, it's unlikely that any CP/M system of the 1980s (or even now)
would have twelve different serial devices attached; multiple names mapped onto the
same physical port. Sometimes the different names referred to the same hardware, used in 
slightly different ways. Some of the physical devices (like UP) were unidirectional; some were
bidirectional. 
</p>

<h2>Mapping logical to physical devices</h2>

<p>
If the BIOS and BDOS only allowed access to four serial devices, how can an application
use all the other, 'physical' devices? This is achieved by mapping the physical devices
onto the four logical devices. It would be nice if any of the twelve
physical devices could be mapped to any of the four logical devices, but CP/M was never that
flexible. Instead, a single, 8-bit byte controls the assignments of all four logical devices.
This piece of data is conventionally called 'IOBYTE', and is stored at address 0003 in the
CPU's address space. Four pairs of bits control the mappings of the four logical devices,
according to the following table.  
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
     Device   CONSOLE   READER     PUNCH      LIST     
     Bits     0,1       3,4         4,5        6,7   

       00:    TTY        TTY        TTY        TTY 
       01:    CRT        PTR        PTP        CRT  
       10:    BAT        UR1        UP1        LPT 
       11:    UC1        UR2        UP2        UL1       
</pre>

<p>
Note that the default value, zero, leaves all the virtual devices mapped to TTY, which is
typically the console. The PUNCH device can be mapped to three other physical devices, 
all of which are historically 'punch-like': PTP ('paper tape punch') and UPx ('user punch').
The LIST device can be mapped to the console, but also to the 'printer-like' devices
LPT ('line printer') and UL1 ('user lineprinter'). 
</p>

<p>
It's vital to understand that the CP/M did not impose any binding interpretation 
on the four standard logical devices <i>or</i> the physical devices. The UPx and URx
devices, if they existed at all, would typically correspond to RS232 ports on the back
of the machine. It was up to the user what got plugged into those ports. If the machine
had a Centronics-style printer port, it was probably assigned to the LPT device. In the end,
though, the machine vendor decided what the physical devices did. The vendor may have
provided tools to configure these devices, or to assign particular names to particular ports,
but there was no commonality between vendors.,
but there was no commonality between vendors.
</p>

<h2>Mapping serial devices in practice</h2>
<p>
Suppose, for example, that a serial modem is connected to the UC1 ('user
console') port. How can I use the modem to communicate with some remote
computer to which it is connected over a telephone network?  
</p>
<p>
One simple method would be to change the lowest two bits of IOBYTE to the value '11'.
Anything that reads or writes the standard CONSOLE device will now be using the UC1 port,
rather than the connected terminal. The ROMWBW version of CP/M has a utility 
<code>talk</code> that performs exactly this assignment, and then just reads from the 
'console' (however that is mapped)
and echoes the results back to the console. So, for as long as this
program is running, data to and from the local console will be relayed to the remote
system via the modem. 
</p>

<h2>How do we do this in modern computers?</h2>
<p>
The modern computing industry has been so thoroughly infiltrated by the Unix way of doing
things, that sometimes it's hard to imagine that there is more than one way to solve a
particular 
problem. One of the key design philosophies of Unix is 'everything is a file'. The Unix
founders recognized that things like 'read' and 'write' are generic operations, which can
be applied to a huge range of hardware. 'Writing' to a serial modem is implemented very
differently from writing to a file on disk but, in the end, both operations amount to sending
data to some piece of hardware. A programmer should not have to worry about the particularities.
</p>
<p>
So a piece of program code for Unix (and its derivatives like Linux) would interact with
all devices in essentially the same way. It would open a suitable driver, and then call the
functions <code>read()</code>, <code>write()</code>, etc., on an integer file handle. In the 
simplest cases,
it's irrelevant what the hardware actually is.
</p>
<p>
The developers of CP/M did not see things this way. It's reasonable to ask why we 
should use the same APIs
to operate on different kinds of hardware that have little in common. That we don't ask is 
illustrative of how influential Unix has been. But the Unix approach leads
to problems that simply don't exist in CP/M. For example, in a Linux console program, how
can I check whether the user has pressed a key without actually waiting for keyboard data? This is
a surprisingly involved process, and the complexity stems from the fact that a keyboard <i>isn't</i>
a file. If 'everything is a file', then core functionality is based on the way files
behave. Linux I/O works the same on all devices <i>for the functionality they all have in
common</i>. Access to functionality that is specific to a particular piece of hardware
is often difficult. 
</p>
<p>
In a CP/M program, if I want to know whether the user has pressed a key, I just call 
BDOS function 6. It's really that simple. It's simple because CP/M <i>doesn't</i>
strive for commonality between different devices. The Unix approach is very powerful, but
it has its problems -- problems that did not exist in CP/M, or even in MSDOS.
</p>
<p>
Unix does not really recognize that some serial devices are unidirectional. I can write code
that reads from a serial printer or a video display, and the results will be unpredictable.
I can't make such a mistake in CP/M -- the API calls simply don't exist in the operating
system. There are BDOS functions to read and write the console, but there is no function
to read the printer, because that isn't something it made sense to do on a printer, even though
it was meaningful for some devices.
</p>
<p>
It's also worth bearing in mind that the CP/M method of determining which logical devices
map onto which physical devices requires <i>exactly one byte</i> of configuration. We
no longer have to worry much about the odd few bytes, or even the odd few megabytes, but
RAM was a premium product in the CP/M days.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
CP/M's way of handling serial devices is no longer well-documented, and it's quite complicated.
It's worth knowing about, however, even if you're not a CP/M user, because it gives useful
insight into how people thought during a crucial time in the history of computing.
