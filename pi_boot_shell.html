<h1>Rolling your own minimal embedded Linux for the Raspberry Pi -- part one: booting to a root shell</h1> 

<img class="article-top-image" src="img/pi.png" 
  alt="Unicode logo"/>
<p>
This first article in my series on building a custom Linux image for
a Raspberry Pi-based appliance describes the most minimal of minimal
installations -- one that boots a kernel and runs a root shell. 
</p>

<h2>Structure of a Pi SD card; how it boots</h2>

<p>
If you're working within the official guidelines, a Raspberry Pi 
bootable SD card must contain at least two partitions. It can contain
more, but you'll need at least two.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
Partition 1: Formatted in DOS/Windows FAT32, at least 40Mb in size,
but typically 256Mb. This contains the binary boot firmware, a 
selection of Linux kernels, and some configuration files. 
To cut a long story short, the boot firmware loads the appropriate
 kernel, which then
mounts partition 2 (read only), and runs a binary 
on it -- by default, this is <code>/bin/init</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Partition 2: Usually formatted ext4, large enough to contain
the root filesystem. Typically this partition will take up the 
whole of the rest of the SD card. It must, as a minimum, contain
the binary that the kernel loads but, apart from that, it's
entirely up to you what goes in the root filesystem. In practice,
even in the most minimal of embedded systems, the root fileystem
will usually contain at least some elements that are found in
a desktop or server Linux -- kernel modules, for example.</p>
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's not common to provide a swap partition, nor a separate partition
for <code>/home</code> or <code>/usr</code>, although it's 
possible in principle.
</p>


<h2>Step 0: preparation</h2>

<p>
You'll need...
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a Raspberry Pi, recent enough to run an up-to-date Raspbian 
  version, with a power supply and (optionally) a case;</p></li>
<li><p>an SD card of at least 512Mb capacity
(but I doubt anybody makes them that small any more, and bigger is fine, of course);</p></li>
<li><p>a Linux workstation -- the exact Linux version doesn't matter;</p></li>
<li><p>a way to read and write SD cards;</p></li>
<li><p>a keyboard and HDMI monitor, with cables to the Pi;</p></li>
<li><p>lots of patience.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
I would recommend not copying files directly on the SD card you plan
to boot the Pi from, even if the card is properly formatted. You're probably
going to break things repeatedly whilst experimenting, so you need
a way to recreate a working card from scratch. Instead, I suggest
creating 
a staging directory to hold the two sets of files you need:
the boot firmware to go into partition 1, and the root filesystem
to go into partition 2.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ mkdir -p staging/boot
$ mkdir -p staging/rootfs
</pre>

<p>
In addition, when I say things like "copy this file to..." you should read that as "create a shell script to copy this file to..." Building a custom
Linux distribution is not straightforward, and you'll probably end up
repeating the set-up steps over and over again. Any amount of automation
will help to preserve your sanity.
</p>


<h2>Step 1: Getting the boot firmware for partition 1</h2>

<p>
The 'official' boot firmware contains bootloaders and kernels to
support all the current Pi models. If you're trying to be very
minimalist, you could delete the bits that don't apply to your model --
but good luck figuring out which bits you don't need. Unless you're trying
to save every byte, it's hardly worth worrying, since the complete 
bundle is only about 40Mb.
</p>
<p>
So far as I know, the only supported source of boot firmware is 
from the official Raspian boot images. The procedure for unpacking
the firmware, without burning an actual SD card, is as follows.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Download the latest Raspian or NOOBS distribution from the 
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">raspberrypi.org</a> download page. Don't worry -- you won't have to run it. There's no reason to download anything other than the most minimal distribution</li>
<li><p>Unpack the zipfile to get the <code>.img</code></p></li>
<li><p>Mount the first partition from the <code>.img</code> file in a convenient place (see below)</p></li>
<li><p>Copy all the files from the partition into your staging area</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Mounting the specific partition can be a little fiddly, because you'll
need to skip the partition table. To figure out how, first examine
the partition table like this:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
$ fdisk -l /path/to/raspian.img

Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
...
Device                       Boot  Start     End Sectors   Size Id Type
Raspbian_RPi-ARMv6-Buster.img1        8192  532479  524288   256M  c W95 FAT32 (LB
Raspbian_RPi-ARMv6-Buster.img2      532480 2085648 1553169 758.4M 83 Linux
</pre>

<p>
The sector size is 512 bytes, and partition 1 starts at sector 8192.
512 x 8192 is 4194304, so that's the offset to use when mounting
the image.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ sudo mount -o loop,offset=4194304 /path/to/raspian.img /mnt/tmp
$ cp /mnt/tmp/* staging/boot
$ sudo umount /mnt/tmp
</pre>

<p>
When you copy the boot firmware from the SD card image, you needn't
worry about file attributes, because they are going to a VFAT
partition. You'll need to be a little more careful when you build the root
filesystem, as described next.
</p>
<p>
At the time of writing, a simpler way of getting the boot firmware
is from 
<a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/boot">GitHub</a>.
The problem with this approach is that it's difficult to be sure you're
getting a supportable version -- that is, a version that corresponds to
one of the Raspbian releases. Depending on what you're building,
that may or may not be a problem.
</p>


<h2>Step 2: building a minimal root filesystem</h2>

<p>
Let's first consider the minimal requirements to have the kernel
execute a root shell. The shell need not be particularly functional
for this exercise -- in fact, it certainly won't be -- it just needs
to prove that the boot is complete.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Most obviously, you need the shell executable itself -- <code>/bin/sh</code>, <code>/bin/bash</code>, or whatever</p></li>
<li><p>The dynamic loader, assuming your shell is a dynamic executable
(and it need not be -- more on this later). The dynamic loader in recent
Raspian releases is <code>/lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3</code></p></li>
<li><p>The dynamic libraries on which the shell depends.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Since we're only booting to a root shell, you won't need anything that
is normally found in the <code>/etc</code> directory. Nor will you need,
at this stage, any kernel modules. 
</p>
<p>
So how will we build the minimal root filesystem?
</p>


<h3>Option 2a: building a root filesystem by picking files 
from an existing distribution</h3>
<p>
It would be nice if there were, in the standard Raspian distribution, a
<code>.deb</code> package whose description was "Files needed to boot
to a shell". Unfortunately there isn't. Well, that's not quite true --
see the alternative option using <code>busybox</code> later in this
article.
</p>
<p>
I've already explained how to mount partition 1 of a standard Raspian
SD card image by finding the offset of the partition. The same procedure
can be used to mount partition 2, and get the root filesystem. You can
then pick out the bits you need for a minimal root filesystem.
</p>
<p>
Needless to say, that's not straightforward, and a lot of trial and
error will be required, unless you're very lucky, or very methodical.
To save a bit of time, the following are the files you need from
Raspbian Buster to boot to the <code>bash</code> shell, and be able
to run <code>ls</code>, and nothing else. So these files need to be
copied to <code>staging/rootfs</code>, bearing in mind that some
of them are symbolic links, not regular files (so use <code>cp -a</code>
or similar).
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
bin/ls
bin/bash
lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libpcre.so.3.13.3
lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libpcre.so.3
lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libdl.so.2
lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libdl-2.28.so
lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libtinfo.so.6.1
lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libtinfo.so.6
lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libtinfo.so.5.9
lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libtinfo.so.5
lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libpthread.so.0
lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libselinux.so.1
lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libc.so.6
lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3
</pre>

<p>
You'll probably want to add more basic infrastructure than this in due
course. You can add whole packages from the Raspian repository, and
sometimes it will be appropriate to do this; or you can just add
individual binaries. If you have a working desktop Raspberry Pi,
you can use <code>ldd</code> to work out what libraries the binaries
need. You'll still need some trial-and-error, though.
</p>

<h3>Option 2b: building a root filesystem using busybox-static</h3>

<p>
<code>busybox</code> is an interesting project that attempts to provide
minimal versions of the all the common command-line utilities --
<code>ls</code>, <code>cp</code>, etc., all in a single executable.
In particular, <code>busybox</code> provides a shell which is broadly
compatible with the traditional <code>sh</code> Bourne shell.
</p>
<p>
To avoid the need for installing many additional libraries, we can
use a statically-linked version of <code>busybox</code>.
</p>
<p>
To use a single executable to provide many utilities, <code>busybox</code>
expects to be invoked using the name of the relevant utility. Since
<code>busybox</code> is only one file, to get different names we have
to create symbolic links in the <code>/bin</code> directory with different
names, all pointing to the <code>busybox</code> binary. In this current
example all we need is an instance of </code>/bin/sh</code>, so we
create this symlink in <code>/bin</code> as follows.
</p>
<p>
First, download <code>busybox-static</code> from the main Raspbian repository.
At the time of writing, the latest release for Raspberry Pi
is <a href="http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/pool/main/b/busybox/busybox-static_1.30.1-4_armhf.deb">1.30, for Raspbian Buster</a>. In case
you didn't know, Debian <code>.deb</code> files are just <code>ar</code>
archives with a particular format. So unpack the <code>.deb</code> and
build the root filesystem as follows.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ ar x busybox-static_1.30.1-4_armhf.deb
# This gets you data.tar.xz, among other things
$ cd staging/rootfs
$ tar xf /path/to/data.tar.xz
$ cd bin
$ ln -sf busybox sh
$ rm -rf usr # Don't need any of the docs or examples
</pre>

<p>
At the end of this process, your entire root filesystem looks like
this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ ls -lR staging/rootfs

total 4
drwxr-xr-x 2 kevin kevin 4096 Jan 21 12:51 bin

staging2/rootfs/bin:
total 1568
-rwxr-xr-x 1 kevin kevin 1603144 Apr  1  2019 busybox
lrwxrwxrwx 1 kevin kevin       7 Jan 21 12:51 sh -> busybox
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Although minimal, this will be enough to get a complete boot to a command
prompt.
</p>
<p>
For the purposes of the current exercise, it doesn't matter how you
build the minimal root filesytem -- it's only a basis for customization.
As soon as you can boot to a prompt, you're ready to move onto the
next stage of development.
</p>


<h2>Step 3: editing kernel boot parameters</h2>

<p>
At this stage, the most important change you'll need to make is to
indicate to the kernel what to run when the system starts.
The kernel command line is in the file <code>cmdline.txt</code>, which
should by this time be in your <code>staging/boot</code> directory.
</p>
<p>
The relevant parameter here is <code>init=</code>, which will almost
certainly have the value <code>/bin/init</code>. In fact, in Raspian
<code>/bin/init</code> is a link to <code>systemd</code>, but that's not
important here. We need to ensure that <code>init</code> references
<code>/bin/sh</code> or <code>/bin/bash</code> or whatever shell you
installed above. If you aren't going to use <code>ext4</code> as the
filesystem type of your root filesystem, you'll also need to 
add <code>rootfstype=something</code> as well.
</p>
<p>
<code>cmdline.txt</code> is just a plain text file -- you can edit it
using <code>vi</code>, or whatever you like.
</p>


<h2>Step 4: formatting the SD card</h2>

<p>
The usual way to distribute Raspberry Pi Linux distributions is as
<code>.img</code> files that can be written to an SD card. For 
experimental purposes, however, it's more convenient to set up the
disk partitions manually, and just copy the files into the appropriate
partitions. In practice, you're going to be making small changes and
rebooting repeatedly, and there's no point in copying a large disk
image just to change one or two files. The structure of the SD
card was described  at the start of this article. It's easy enough
to replicate this just using <code>fdisk</code>. In this example,
I'm using a 32Gb card, and it appears to Linux as <code>/dev/sdb</code>.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
# fdisk /dev/sdb

Command (m for help): n

</pre>


<h2>Step 5: copying the files</h2>

<p>
If you've followed the steps above, you should have a directory
<code>staging/boot</code> that needs to be copied to partition 1,
and a directory <code>staging/rootfs</code> for partition 2.
There will be no file attributes in (DOS) partition 1. Looking to 
the future, the files in partition 2 ideally need to be owned
by root. Depending on how you do the copy, this might happen
automatically, or you might have set the ownership explicitly.
In any event, the copy to partition 2 needs to preserve file
attributes <i>other than</i> ownership, and take account of the
fact that not all entries will be regular files.
</p>


<pre class="codeblock">
# mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/tmp
# cp -ar staging/boot/* /mnt/tmp
# umount /dev/sdb1

# mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt/tmp
# cp -ar staging/rootfs/* /mnt/tmp
# chown -R root:root /mnt/tmp/*
# umount /dev/sdb1
# sync
</pre>

<p>
Now you should have a bootable Raspberry Pi SD card ready to test.
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>

<p>
This is a lot of work to go to, just to get a Raspberry Pi to boot
to a prompt. However, this is all groundwork that is needed to get
to a point where you can start working on a real custom
Linux.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, the procedure described above will get you to a system
that will operate the official Raspberry Pi 7" touchscreen. If you're
planning an appliance with a built-in screen, it's good to know that you
can test with this minimal procedure. You won't be able to set
the brightness -- you need a kernel module for that -- but you'll
be able to see a text console.
</p>
