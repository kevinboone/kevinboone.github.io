<h1>Raspberry Pi Pico: loading code into RAM and running it -- part 1</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/chip.png" 
  alt="Chip logo"/>
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
Please bear in mind that this article applies to the original Pico, with RP2040
chip. I'm not sure how much of it, if any, applies to later RP devices.
</blockquote>

This article is the first of (at least) two on the subject of 
running binary code
in RAM on the Raspberry Pi Pico. This article explains the memory 
layout of the Pico and where space can be found for the binary code. The 
<a href="pico_run_ram2.html">second article</a> covers compiling code 
for the Pico in such a way
that it can actually be run this way.
</p>
<p>
While this article is concerned with the Pico C SDK, I should point out
that I'm not talking about running an application built with the SDK from
RAM. The SDK already has a mechanism to do just this. Rather, I'm talking
about using an application built with the SDK, and deployed in flash
(ROM) to load and run <i>other</i> applications from RAM.
</p>
<p>
Why on Earth would you want to do such a thing? Well, if you store 
binary code on, say, an SD card, this opens the way to running applications
that are hugely larger than the (2Mb) size of the flash. Admittedly, 
these applications would have to be divided into segments of not more than
about 200kB, because that's all the RAM that is available. Still, that's
a tractable problem for many applications. 
</p>
<p>
Moreover, you might want to be able to run a program from a set
of programs stored on an SD card. If you can do that, then you have
the beginning of an operating system. So running compiled code from RAM
is a useful educational exercise as well. 
</p>
<p>
One thing I <i>won't</i> be covering in these articles is managing an
SD card from Pico code. This subject is already illustrated thoroughly in
<a href="https://github.com/carlk3/no-OS-FatFS-SD-SPI-RPi-Pico" target="blank_">this demonstration program by Carl Kugler</a>. Here I'm assuming that you
already have a way to make your code available.
</p>
<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>I'm writing this article for experienced C developers, who are already familiar with the Pi Pico C SDK. I'm not assuming much knowledge of ARM Cortex programming, but some would be helpful.</blockquote>

<h2>Memory layout</h2>
<p>
In order to run code from RAM we need to know how much RAM is available,
where it is, and how it's addressed. The first question is easy to
answer -- 264kB of RAM is installed. The amount that is actually available
isn't easy to determine with certainty -- more on that topic later. As
for addressing -- for our purposes, the Pico CPU has a linear, physical
memory space that includes flash and RAM. We don't (for our present purposes)
have to worry about memory virtualization. The address space starts with
address zero, and extends to 0x20042000. Of course, most of this 512Mb
address range is, in fact, unused.
</p>
<p>
The diagram below shows the Pico memory map, when running a program created
with the Pico C SDK. It is not to scale, because the Flash is hugely
larger than the RAM, and most of the address space is unused.
Interpreting the map can be a little awkward, because of the large number
of 2s and 4s in all the addresses. 
</p>
<p>
The flash occupies the memory map from zero to 0x0200000 (2Mb). The 
installed RAM starts at 0x20000000. Note that there's more than 500Mb
of unused space between flash and RAM. 
The RAM itself is a 264kB region, from 0x20000000 to 0x20042000. 
</p>

<i>Pico memory map, when using the Pico C SDK. This diagram is not
remotely to scale.</i>
</p>

<p>
At the top of RAM are the stacks -- each CPU core needs its own stack,
typically 4kB in size. At the bottom of RAM is the work area for the
program created by the C SDK. This area includes some general data
but, in particular, any memory dynamically allocated using
<code>malloc()</code> and the like will end up here. 
</p>
<p>
How large is this area? Well, there's no way to be certain, as it 
depends on how much memory the SDK program uses. In the diagram I have
assumed that the SDK program uses 8Kb of memory, putting the
top of that region at 0x20004000. But I've marked it with "??" because
this is variable and, unless the main application does no dynamic allocation
at all, it can only be determined by testing. Some flexibility will
be required in this area.
</p>
<p>
Assuming that my assessment of the memory used by the SDK program is
correct, we can load the code to be executed in RAM at 0x20004000, and that's
the address I will assume in the rest of this article.
</p>

<h2>Calling code in RAM</h2>

<p>
At this point I'm assuming that we have a way to get the executable
code into RAM, and have been able to compile or assemble it to be
compatible with the address where we will load it -- 0x20004000 in
this example.
</p>
<p>
So far as I know, C doesn't have a mechanism to transfer control to a 
particular, explicit address. However, we can define a function pointer,
and assign it a specific address. Then we can call the address through
the pointer. Here's how that looks:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#0000FF">typedef</font></b> <font color="#009900">void</font> <font color="#990000">(*</font>EntryFn<font color="#990000">)</font> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#009900">void</font><font color="#990000">);</font>
<font color="#008080">EntryFn</font> entry <font color="#990000">=</font> <font color="#990000">(</font>EntryFn<font color="#990000">)</font> <font color="#993399">0x20004000</font> <font color="#990000">|</font> <font color="#993399">1</font><font color="#990000">.</font>
<b><font color="#000000">entry</font></b><font color="#990000">();</font>
</pre>

<p>
A glaring oddity here is the <code>| 1</code> applied to the address. 
To understand why this is necessary, we need a short digression into
ARM instruction set design.
</p>
<p>
ARM CPUs have historically supported two complete instruction sets: 
one in which each op-code is 32 bits (usually just called the 
"ARM instruction set") and one of 16 bits, called "thumb". For many
applications the thumb instruction set is preferable to the ARM set 
-- twice as many
instructions can be read from memory in the same time, and they only 
take half as much memory. Of course, there are many operations that
need more thumb instructions to specify than would be required with the
larger ARM op-codes. Still, the trade-off is an effective one for
some applications.  
</p>
<p>
The ARM Cortex M0+ CPU on which the Pico is based <i>only</i> supports
thumb instructions. Trying to execute ARM op-codes will eventually
lead to a crash or a CPU halt. Because both ARM and thumb modes are
notionally available, the CPU needs a way to switch between them. It
does this using the least-significant bit of a branch instruction. Since
ARM op-codes have to be aligned on 2-byte or 4-byte boundaries, the 
least-significant bit does not, in fact, carry any information about the
address: you can't actually branch to an odd-numbered address. So using
this bit for mode switching makes sense -- at least in the mad world
of ARM it does. 
</p>
<p>
When you write a function call in C you don't have to worry about this:
the compiler will generate the correct branch address. However, when 
branching to a specific address, as in the example code above, you need
to set the least-significant bit of the address explicitly, so 
that the CPU will stay in thumb mode.  
</p>
<p>
If the code you are running in RAM calls into the flash at a specific
address, it will have to set the least-significant bit in the same way.
This is something that is easy to overlook, and can be difficult
to troubleshoot.
</p>

<h2>Calling from RAM to flash</h2>
<p>
There's much more flash than there is RAM so, if you're writing programs
to run from RAM, it makes sense to put as many general-purpose routines
in flash as possible. After all, almost every program will need a way
to copy blocks of memory around and toggle GPIO pins. Many will need
a way to read additional files from the SD card, and this takes a substantial
amount of code. If you've already written code to read data from an
SD card, just to get your code into RAM, it makes sense to make that code
available to program in RAM, rather than duplicating it. 
</p>
<p>
The problem is that the locations of the relevant routines in RAM
will not be known; or, at least, they cannot be guaranteed to remain
the same when the contents of flash change. We can get around this problem
in exactly the same way that operating systems do: we provide a 
<i>single</i> entry point into the code in flash, that takes a numeric
code indicating which routine to run. 
</p>
<p>
In the operating system world, calling a routine this way is called
a <i>system call</i> or <i>syscall</i> or a <i>software interrupt</i> 
(SWI). An SWI goes a bit further than a simple call into a routine --
most CPUs, including ARM, use SWI to change from "user" mode to "supervisor"
(or "kernel") mode. If all we need to do is to call from RAM to flash on
a Pico, we don't have to worry about these subtleties -- we'll just store
the address of the syscall entry point at some well-know, fixed address
in RAM, and the program in RAM will read that address and branch to
it to make a system call.
</p>

<p>
In a traditional operating system design, syscalls are used for
invoking the kernel, typically for doing I/O operations on hardware.
These calls operate with higher privileges than
user code. However, when programming for the Pico, I've found it
useful to provide syscalls for many other things that require
significant code. For example, I implement number conversion
functions like <code>strtol()</code> as syscalls. They require a significant
amount of code that almost any program, whether running from flash or RAM,
will need -- directly or indirectly. 
</p>
<p>
This would be a crazy thing to do in an operating system. The change from
user mode to supervisory mode is relatively time-consuming, and we don't
want to do more in supervisory mode than is absolutely essential. In
a microcontroller, however, it makes sense to implement as many
general-purpose routines as syscalls as the ROM can accommodate. Since
there is no mode switch, there are no overheads involved in doing this,
and we need to preserve as much RAM as possible. In any case, a program
that calls a specific address in flash has to make the address
least-significant-bit modification we discussed earlier. 
</p>

<h2>Passing arguments from flash to RAM</h2>
<p>
In the simple example above, the function in RAM was defined to
take no arguments and return no result. In practice, we will need
both arguments and return values.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, if we use the same C compiler to build both the calling
and the called program, and we're careful how it is invoked, we
won't have to worry about this. The compiler will generate compatible
argument-passing code for both programs. If we're using an assembler, then
we'll need to understand how arguments are passed.  
</p>
<p>
There is a well-established calling convention for ARM programming.
The first four integer or pointer arguments are stored in
registers r0-r4. That's sufficient for many function calls. If the function
takes more arguments than this, they are passed on the stack. The 
return value is passed in the r0 register. Floating-point arguments are
rather more fiddly to handle, but this subject is 
<a herf="https://github.com/ARM-software/abi-aa/blob/2982a9f3b512a5bfdc9e3fea5d3b298f9165c36b/aapcs32/aapcs32.rst" target="_blank">well documented</a>
(although this documentation tends to change, and move around, so a bit of
web searching may be needed).
</p>
<p>
As I said, though, the intricacies or argument passing are only important
if you're calling from C to assembly code, or vice versa. All C compilers,
I believe, that support ARM use the same calling convention. 
</p>

<h2>Returning from a called function in RAM</h2>
<p>
If the calling function was implemented in C, it will have stored the
return address in the ARM link register, so the called function returns
simply by executing <code>bx lr</code>. Again, this is only significant
when programming in assembly language -- a C compiler knows how to
generate the right code.
</p>
<h2>What next?</h2>
<p>
In this article I've described how the Pico memory is organized, and
how calls can be made from flash to RAM and vice versa. In the next
article I'll describe how to use the GCC compiler and linker to
create code that is suitable to be loaded into RAM and executed.
