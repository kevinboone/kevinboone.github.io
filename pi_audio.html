<h1>Rolling your own minimal embedded Linux for the Raspberry Pi -- part four: audio</h1> 

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/pi.png" 
  alt="Pi logo"/>
This series of articles is about 
building up a custom, minimal Linux installation for the Raspberry
Pi (or similar), for use in an appliance. As I've complained repeatedly,
the Raspberry Pi units -- particularly the small ones -- are ideal for
low-volume embedded use, but all the official Linux releases for the
Pi are 
oriented towards desktop-type operation. To assemble a Linux installation
suitable for embedded operation means, essentially, starting
from the very beginning, with a kernel and a shell. 
</p>
<p>
The previous article in the series, on 
<a href="pi_remote_access.html">managing services and remote access</a>
was fairly complicated but this one, I hope, will be a lighter read.
It's still not trivially simple -- I envisage a system where
<i>everything</i> has to be configured manually -- in an appliance-oriented
Linux we can't rely on udev, DBus, systemd, and all the other heavyweight
infrastructure that a desktop or server Linux would have.
</p>

<h2>Constraints</h2>
<p>
Although many desktop Linux systems now use Pulse or JACK for complex
audio processing and routing, for an embedded system it's likely to
be better to rely on native ALSA support. ALSA is already quite
sophisticated, except perhaps where integration with graphical tools is
concerned. I question whether the complexity of Pulse is really
necessary on most desktop Linux systems -- but I'm sure it's rarely 
necessary in an appliance.  
</p>
<p>
I'm assuming that, in an embedded system, there will only be one
audio device. It isn't all that difficult to handle multiple devices
with ALSA,
but the absence of management frameworks like DBus creates more 
work for the system builder, if you want the user to be able to
switch devices at runtime.
</p>
<p>
The built-in audio hardware on the Pi 3B range is.... adequate. 
It's OK for speech and general warning beeps, but it's not
exactly hi-fi. On the other hand, more-or-less any general-purpose USB
audio device will work with the Pi, given the appropriate drivers.
The Pi 3's share the internal USB bus with the networking components,
and early models (or early kernels) were prone to drop-outs in 
USB audio. This doesn't seem to be a problem for the latest
models (or the latest kernels), at least at CD audio sampling 
rates or lower. In any case, it doesn't make a huge difference
to software configuration what kind of audio device you use,
but supporting multiple devices in a minimal appliance will
be a bit of a challenge. At the time of writing, I'm not
sure whether the Pi 4 will change this situation. 
</p>

<h2>Initial checks</h2>

<p>
As a first step, if you plan to use the Pi's built-in audio capabilities,
ensure that audio is not disabled in firmware. In the boot partition,
in <code>config.txt</code>, ensure there is a line like this:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
dtparam=audio=on
</pre>
<p>
Some Pi models (or some kernels) automatically route the built-in
audio to the HDMI when an HDMI monitor is connected. There are software
tools to change this, and there are HDMI in-line dongles that will 
extract the audio to a headphone jack if you're using an HDMI monitor
without audio support. In any case, it's important to be aware that,
if audio seems to be working but you're not hearing anything, the
problem might not be in software -- you might just have your speaker/headphone
connected to the wrong port.
</p>

<h2>Software required</h2>

<p>
Most of the required software is in kernel modules. If you have
kernel modules in the conventional tree structure, and an up-to-date
<code>modules.dep</code> file (e.g., from running <code>depmod</code>)
then loading just the device-level module will suffice -- the module-loading
infrastructure will take take of the dependencies. If you're handling
modules explicitly, you'll need to work out all the dependencies, either
by trial-and-error, or by examining the <code>modules.dep</code>
from a desktop Raspbian system. 
</p>
<p>
In the Raspberry Pi 3 series, the built-in sound generator is supported by the
<code>snd-bcm2835</code> module. Its dependencies are <code>snd-pcm</code>,
<code>snd-timer</code>, and <code>snd</code>. Most USB sound devices are
supported by <code>snd-usb-audio</code>, whose dependencies are
<code>snd-hwdep</code>, <code>snd-usbmidi-lib</code>, <code>snd-rawmidi</code>,
<code>snd-seq-device</code>, <code>snd-pcm</code>, <code>snd-timer</code>, and
<code>snd</code>. I don't really understand why the USB audio module has
dependencies on MIDI modules -- I presume that USB MIDI devices and USB
PCM devices are supported by the same module.
</p>
<p>
Although it is possible, in principle, to produce audio by writing to
the ALSA devices in <code>/dev/snd</code> (of which, more below), in practice
I think every application or library that uses ALSA does so through
the <code>libasound.so</code> library. This library is in the 
<code>libasound2</code> Raspbian package.  
</p>
<p>
Unless you're very lucky, or very knowledgeable, it's probably worth
installing the basic ALSA utilities like <code>alsamixer</code> and
<code>aplay</code>. These are all in the <code>alsa-utils</code> 
package. In the experimental stage, <code>aplay -L</code> is particularly
useful, as it displays a list of output devices. This will usually
be a long list, even if only the built-in audio is enabled, as there
will be multiple virtual devices with different capabilities.  
</p>
<p>
There will be, for example, different devices for the 3.5mm audio
jack and the HDMI audio channel. An additional important distinction
is between the <code>hw</code> and <code>plughw</code> devices --
in most cases the <code>plughw</code> device is more appropriate, 
because it will do the appropriate sample rate and format conversions
when playing audio with properties that not directly supported by 
the hardware.
</p>

<h2><code>/dev/snd</code> devices</h2>

<p>
If the driver modules are installed and initialized properly,
you should see entries created in the <code>/dev/snd</code> 
directory. You don't need <code>udev</code> for this to happen
-- the pseudo-devices are created directly by the kernel. 
With a single PCM audio device (like the built-in audio hardware),
you should see something like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ ls -l /dev/snd
crw-rw---- 1 root root 116,  0 Feb 29 09:59 controlC0
crw-rw---- 1 root root 116, 16 Feb 29 09:59 pcmC0D0p
crw-rw---- 1 root root 116, 17 Feb 29 09:59 pcmC0D1p
crw-rw---- 1 root root 116,  1 Nov  8 20:17 seq
crw-rw---- 1 root root 116, 33 Feb 29 09:59 timer
</pre>

<p>
In a desktop system, however, the group ownership of these devices
is conventionally changed by <code>udev</code> to <code>audio</code>.
This is a sensible change, even in an embedded system -- you probably
don't want the kind of processes that produce audio running
as <code>root</code>. In the absence of <code>udev</code>, you'll
need to make the ownership change in some script -- probably the
same script that loads the kernel modules.
</p>
<p>
Then, all being well, any process that is a member of the group
<code>audio</code> will be able to play audio.
