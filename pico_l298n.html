the Pi Pico with an L298N module to control a 12V motor</h1>
<p><img src="img/pi.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>Sometimes we want to control a DC motor using a Raspberry Pi Pico. In
my application, I’m controlling G-scale model railway trains, because –
why not? These trains have a 45mm track gauge, and a complete train
might weight kilograms, so the locomotives have fairly hefty DC
motors.</p>
<p>Naturally, connecting a motor directly to the GPIO pins will be
unhelpful – the motor might need need amps of current. We might need to
control the speed of the motor, using pulse-width modulation, for
example. And, as a motor can spin in two directions, we might need a way
to control the direction of current flow, as well as magnitude.</p>
<p>This article is about controlling a 9V-12V motor, using the Pi Pico
with the <a
href="https://www.handsontec.com/dataspecs/module/L298N%20Motor%20Driver.pdf">L298N
motor driver module from HandsOn Tech</a>. This little module is all
over the Internet, and for good reasons: it’s dirt cheap – probably
cheaper than the components it’s made from, in small quantities. I’ve
seen them for as little as UK£12 per dozen. Each module can control two
motors, supplying up to 2A to each motor in either direction, and can
interface to 5V (Arduino) and 3.3V (Pi, Pico) logic levels.</p>
<p>In addition, the module has a built-in voltage regulator that can
supply equipment aside from itself. If you’re using 12V motors, you
probably have a 12V supply somewhere in whatever you’re constructing, so
you might as well use it to power the Pico, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
The L298N module works with the full-size Pi, as well as Pico and
Arduino, but I’m not sure it would sensible to supply even a Pi 1 from
the module’s built-in voltage regulator. Please see the discussion of
the voltage regulator below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the module is reasonably well-documented, I’ve seen little
specific to the Pico. So, in this article, I’ll give some notes about
using it with the Pico, and a typical connection diagram. I’ll also
point out some places where the manufacturer’s data is ambiguous, and
the designer might need to be cautious.</p>
<h2 id="basic-principle">Basic principle</h2>
<p>The L298N is a dual H-brige. Each bridge contains four transistors,
which can be switched on in pairs, to control not only whether current
flows in the motor, but in which direction. Switching on one pair of
transistors causes current to flow in one direction, the other pair
makes it flow in the other direction. Switching both pairs of
transistors on would create a short-circuit across the power supply
(ouch), so the L298N has built-in logic that prevents this happening. If
you try to switch both transistor pairs on, neither will switch on.</p>
<p>Buffer logic ensures that the transistors can be switched on using
any control voltage above about 2V, and off with any control voltage
below about 1V. This makes the L298N suitable for use with the Pico’s
3.3V GPIO levels.</p>
<p>The L298N module has six logic inputs, labeled EN A, EN B, IN1, IN2,
IN3, and IN4. The two motor outputs are labeled A and B. The EN pins
enable the controller bridge for a specific motor, A or B. With a
microcontroller you’ll probably be using the “IN” pins for this purpose,
so the EN pins are jumpered into the ‘on’ position by default.</p>
<p>IN1 and IN2 control motor A. When IN1 is high, current flows in one
direction in the motor. When IN2 is high, current flows in the opposite
direction. In the circuit diagram below, the red wire to the motor is
positive with respect to the black wire when IN1 is high, and negative
when IN2 is high. Setting both IN1 and IN2 high will cause no current to
flow.</p>
<p>IN3 and IN4 perform exactly the same functions for motor B.</p>
<h2 id="voltage-regulator">Voltage regulator</h2>
<p>The capabilities of the built-in voltage regulator are, perhaps, not
as well documented as they could be. The module has a jumper to enable
the regulator; it’s cunningly hidden between the blocks of two and three
screw terminals. If you <em>don’t</em> enable it, you’ll need to supply
5V from some external source.</p>
<p>The L298N chip needs a 5V supply, regardless of the supply voltage to
the motors. When the regulator is enabled (jumper in place), then the 5V
supply for the chip is derived from the supply voltage on the module’s
12V terminal, which also supplies the motors. In practice, you’ll get
away with 9-12V (maybe a bit more). This configuration makes the 5V
terminal a <em>source of current</em> which can supply other equipment,
as well as the L298N itself – but this requires caution (more
later).</p>
<p>When the jumper is removed, then you’ll need to provide an
alternative supply to the 5V terminal. This configuration makes the
module’s 5V terminal a current sink, rather than a source.</p>
<p>The module’s maximum supply voltage – and thus the maximum motor
voltage – when using the built-in regulator is ambiguous. The
manufacturer’s documentation refers to both “12V” and “35V”. The supply
terminal on the board is labeled “12V”. The voltage regulator is just a
standard 78M05 in surface-mount format. This is a linear, not switching,
regulator, so the heat dissipated in the regulator will increase in
proportion to the supply voltage.</p>
<p>The datasheet for the 78M05 says that its maximum input voltage is
35V which, I imagine, is where the “35V” figure in the module’s
documentation comes from. However, I suspect that using a supply voltage
that high will cause the voltage regulator to get very hot, and it has
no heat-sink.</p>
<p>That, I think, is why the documentation says (in places) that the
maximum input voltage is “12V”, even though the regulator can tolerate a
higher voltage. I haven’t tried, but I imagine that the regulator would
tolerate a supply voltage a little above 12V, but I wouldn’t risk this
in anything critical.</p>
<p>All this means that if you’re using a power supply with 9-12V range,
you don’t need an additional 5V supply, and you can use the built-in
regulator to supply your Pico as well – within reason.</p>
<p>How much power will be dissipated in the regulator, when it’s
powering a Pico? In the worst case, the Pico could draw 100mA, so the
dissipation with a 12V supply is (12 - 5) * 0.1 = 700mW. That’s quite a
lot of power in a surface-mount device with no heat-sink.</p>
<p>In my applications, the Pico is only drawing ~20mA, and I’m less
concerned about the regulator. If in doubt, provide a separate 5V
supply. Perhaps use a conventional 7805 in a package that can have a
heat-sink fitted. Better, use a 12V-5V switching regulator. These are
now very cheap, because they’re used to provide USB charger sockets in
cars.</p>
<h2 id="application-circuit">Application circuit</h2>
<p>Here is a diagrammatic representation of how to connect the Pico to a
12V motor, with the whole set-up powered by a 12V battery. GPIO pins 22
and 27 (in this case) control the direction of the motor – a ‘high’ on
GPIO 27 causes the motor current to be in the red-to-black direction,
while a high on GPIO 22 makes the current flow black-to-red, reversing
the motor’s direction of spin.</p>
<p><img src="img/l298n.png" class="article-centre-image" /></p>
<p>The resistors are not strictly necessary, and the values are not
critical. I use 47k, because I have a stack of these in my workshop.
Their purpose is simply to prevent a catastrophic failure of the L298N
taking out the Pico as well.</p>
<p>The diode, however, probably is necessary. The circuit uses the 5V
output of the module to power the Pico using its Vsys input. If you
<em>don’t</em> use the diode here, but you connect a USB cable, then
there’s a risk of the USB port trying to power the module’s built-in
regulator <em>backwards</em>, that is, to force current into its output.
Whether this is dangerous, I don’t know – it just looks like a bad idea.
I’m using an IN4008 for this diode because, again, I have a stack of
them. The Pico doesn’t normally draw more than 100mA, and in most
applications it’s probably half this much. This means that the power
dissipated in the diode will be at most about 0.6 * 0.1 = 60mW.</p>
<p>The voltage drop of 0.6V across the diode won’t bother the Pico – it
will work with a supply as low as 1.8V.</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn’t matter what GPIO pins are connected to the
‘in1’ and ‘in2’ inputs on the L298N module, so long as they aren’t in
use for anything else.</p>
<p>With the circuit above, it’s safe to connect a USB cable to a
computer, as well as using the power supply derived from the 12V battery
– the supply from the Pico will be drawn from whichever is the greater –
the 5V generated from Vsys by the internal voltage regulator, or the 5V
supply from the USB port. The Pico bas built-in diodes to prevent these
alternative sources of supply for interfering with one another.</p>
<p>As noted above, I’m not sure this simple circuit would work
effectively if the Pico drew its maximum current, and a separate 5V
regulator would be better.</p>
<h2 id="pwm-control">PWM control</h2>
<p>The L298N is compatible with PWM (pulse width modulation) control.
You can supply pulses of varying duty cycle to IN1-IN4, to control the
speed of the motor, as well as its direction. The kinds of transistor
used in the L298N dissipate an amount of heat that increases with the
switching frequency. The Pico’s built-in PWM controller will operate up
to hundreds of kilohertz, but that might not be advisable here.</p>
<p>In any case, most small-to-medium DC motors work best with PWM
frequencies of tens of kilohertz. If the frequency is too low, you’ll
maybe hear an audible whine, depending on the size and inertia of the
motor.</p>
<p>I’m not going to explain how to use PWM control in the Pico in this
article, but I might do so in a later one. For the record, I’ve found
PWM frequencies in the general region of 20kHz to be effective, with the
sort of motors I’m controlling.</p>
<h2 id="points-to-watch">Points to watch</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The H-bridge configuration does not allow the motor to have a
ground terminal. In practice, one or other motor terminal will be close
to ground voltage, according to which direction the motor is spinning.
However, neither terminal is <em>at</em> ground potential, and
connecting either terminal to one of the supply rails could be
catastrophic.</p></li>
<li><p>The power transistors in the L298N have a non-zero voltage drop.
This means that, in practice, with a 12V supply, your motor will see at
most about 11V, perhaps a bit less at high currents.</p></li>
<li><p>When the motor is turned fully on for an extended period, then
you can expect the L298N to get hot – that, after all, is why it has a
heat-sink. When using PWM control, the device will probably get hot even
when the motor is running at less that full speed, because of switching
losses. It’s probably best to allow for at least a little ventilation,
if possible.</p></li>
<li><p>You can, in theory, increase the current-handling capacity for a
single motor by connecting the motor A and motor B outputs in parallel,
and controlling the IN1/IN3 and IN2/IN4 inputs together. However, it’s
not documented how to wire the motors safely to do this, and it probably
won’t help all that much, because the heat dissipation in the device is
limited by the <em>total</em> current, not the current in a specific
bridge.</p></li>
<li><p>The IN1 to IN4 terminals float low. It’s not absolutely necessary
to pull down unused inputs, although it might be good pratice to do
so.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h2>
<p>The L298N module provides a convenient and inexpensive way to control
motors and similar devices using a Pico, particularly when there needs
to be a way to reverse the direction of current flow. It benefits from a
built-in 5V regulator, reducing component count. However, using this
regulator to supply other equipment requires caution.</p>
