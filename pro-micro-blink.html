<h1>Using Linux command-line tools for programming the SparkFun Pro Micro microcontroller (and similar)</h1> 

<img class="article-top-image" src="img/pro-micro.jpg" 
  alt="Pro Micro"/>
<p>
In this article I describe command-line operations
for building programs for, and deploying them to, the 
SparkFun Pro Micro microcontroller board. I illustrate the process
using very simple examples. Although only 
command-line tools arerequired, having the standard Arduino 
IDE on stand-by remains useful, for reasons that I'll explain.
I've written this article for experienced C/C++ developers who normally
use Linux workstations, and have their own preferences for editors
and build tools. Some, but not all, of this article is relevant to
Arduino-like boards other than the Pro Micro.
</p>
<p>
While I have no particular interest in using the Arduino IDE,
I'm quite happy to use the Arduino libraries. After all, implementing
USB storage or Ethernet support from scratch is a non-trivial
undertaking. It is the use of the Arduino libraries that makes 
building code outside the official IDE so fiddly. 
</p>
<p>
Consequently, in this article I'll first explain how to compile and
upload a program that does <i>not</i> use any standard libraries. Then, 
with the basic principle established, I'll
explain how to include Arduino library components in an application, which 
will always
amount to building them from source.
</p>
<p>
This is a long, and perhaps rather complicated, article. If all you
want to do is run "Blink", there's more information
than you need. However my experience is that, if you're working
outside of the Arduino IDE, developing anything more complicated
than "Blink" becomes overwhelming complicated very quickly. This
is where it's really necessary to understand what's going on
in detail.
</p>
<p>
The (very simple) source code used in this article, and 
a sample Makefile to build and deploy it, are available
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/pro-micro-blink">in my GitHub repository</a>.
</p>

<h2>A note about devices and terminology</h2>
<p>
If you're an experienced Arduino developer -- using any platform
or tools -- you
probably don't need to read this section.
</p>
<p>
This article is specifically about the SparkFun Pro Micro,
which is a type of Arduino-compatible microcontroller unit (MCU)
board. Arduino
is a range of microcontrollers based primarily on the Atmel ATMega 
devices. The Atmel devices are examples of AVR microcontrollers. 
The origin of the term "AVR" is lost in the mists of time, but 
broadly describes a microcontroller with separate data and 
program memories. There are many AVR devices other than the Atmel
range, and many boards based on Atmel devices that are not Arduinos.
The Arduino boards were originally designed for education, and a particular
design goal was that they should be programmable without specialist
equipment.
</p>
<p>
Most modern Arduino, and Arduino-like, devices are programmed using
a USB port, which might also be used by the installed
application after programming.  
</p>
<p>
Arduino devices are not "computers" in the modern sense. They don't
have an operating system, and can't be programmed at runtime. 
They don't easily support multitasking, and there is no hardware
abstraction. What gets uploaded to an Arduino is a single program,
that executes until the board is powered off or a new program
is uploaded. Despite their relatively low clock speeds, microcontrollers
are often better-suited for real-time and time-critical applications
than embedded computers, because there are no operating system overheads
to interfere with the timing.
</p>
<p>
The Pro Micro is an Arduino-compatible board, but not an official
Arduino product. Of the Arduino lineup, it is probably most similar
to the Leonardo, particularly in its use of USB and the inclusion
of an ATMega 32u4 MCU. However, it's much smaller than a Leonardo
-- not much bigger than a postage stamp. It costs about the same as
a pint of beer in a London pub (not that any pubs are open
these days).
</p>
<p>
Its small size and low cost has made the Pro Micro popular in 
applications like custom USB input devices for computers and 
games consoles. 
</p>


<h2>Basic principles -- and why there's a problem here at all</h2>
<p>
Most people, when they start developing for Arduino devices, use 
the official
Arduino IDE tools and the official Arduino libraries. These tools
and libraries are reasonably host-agnostic, and there are plenty
of people doing effective Arduino development on Microsoft Windows systems.
Windows provides little in the way of general-purpose compilation and code
management tools, and an all-in-one IDE and library set
provides a convenient development environment for
the Windows platform. This, after all, is the way most development seems
to be done on Windows.
</p>
<p>
Linux users, on the other hand, have a huge range of general-purpose
editors, build tools, and code management utilities available, and 
usually want to use them. The problem here isn't simply a matter
of preferring to work at the command line -- although many of us do 
-- as there already is
a serviceable Arduino command-line build tool. Rather, it's a matter
of using methods (Makefiles, library management tools, etc) that
we've all become very productive with over the years. There's very
little low-level documentation about how building for Arduino actually
works. Using the standard libraries <i>without</i> the stock IDE
is particularly nasty.
</p>
<p>
The Arduino standard libraries are not supplied as binaries, but 
as source code. The source needs to be compiled and linked into
every application that uses these libraries. Compiling the libraries
is not a one-time job, because different binaries would need to be
made available for every Arduino-type microcontroller (MCU) that
exists.  Moreover
-- and this is the real sticking point -- the binaries would be
different for every board -- even boards that use the same MCU.
That's because different boards do things like USB, or even GPIO
pin assignment, in different ways. It's nice to be able to
write code like <code>Serial.println("Entering main loop")</code> without
worrying about which MCU pins are connected to the USB controller.
</p>
<p>
So when we build an application that uses Arduino libraries, we
have to compile the library components as an intrinsic part of
the application, using the same compiler settings and a bunch
of board-specific definitions. Moreover -- and this is where
we really start to grit our teeth -- the standard library sources
refer to board-specific headers that are provided 
by the board manufacturer. 
</p>
<p>
The IDE takes care of all this complexity, of course; but without the
IDE we have to tackle it head-on. I'll describe in broad terms how
to do that later.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Broadly, building and deploying C/C++ code on an Arduino board amounts
to these steps, most of which should be broadly familiar to an
experienced C/C++ developer.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
Compile all the sources, including the library components.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Link all the compiled object files into a standard Linux ELF binary. 
</p></li>
<li><p>
Convert the ELF binary into an Intel-format hex file for transfer
to the board.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Ensure the board is in bootloader mode (see below).
</p></li>
<li><p>
Use the <code>avrdude</code> tool to push the hex file to the board.
</p></li>
</ul>



<h2>A note about USB operating modes (and how to enable bootloader mode)</h2>
<p>
In my view, the use of the board's USB port is probably the most confusing,
and least well-documented, aspect of using the Pro Micro (and similar
boards). The confusion arises because of the way that the same USB 
port is used for both the bootloader, and for application purposes, 
and can be switched from one mode to the other.
</p>
<p>
In bootloader mode, the board's USB port looks to the host system like a
USB modem. It <i>might</i> look like this when the board
is running user software as well, but that's up to the software
developer.
Depending on how the host system is set up, Linux should create a
<code>/dev/ttyACM*</code> or <code>/dev/ttyUSB*</code> device when
the Pro Micro is plugged in, and in bootloader mode. The distinction
between <code>ttyUSB</code> and <code>ttyASM</code> is not particularly
important in this context -- the difference relates to matters 
such as which side
of the link is responsible for data compression when a <i>real</i>
modem is connected. For the record, "ACM" stands for "Abstract Control
Model". The other term you'll come across when working with the
Pro Micro is "Communications Device Class" (CDC). This is a general
term for USB devices that take part in point-to-point communication
(rather than, for example, storage). 
</p>
<p>
So, in bootloader mode, you should see a <code>/dev</code> device
which you can use to upload code using <code>avrdude</code>. 
However, as soon as application starts to run, the USB device
will be disconnected, and disappear from the host operating system. 
In order to be able to upload code again, one of three things must
happen. 
</p>
<p>
First, you can perform a hard reset to bootloader. On the
Pro Micro this is done by grounding the RST pin <i>twice</i>
within half a second or so. During testing, at least, it's probably
a good idea to wire a pushbutton between the GND and RST pins
for this purpose. These pins are clearly marked on the board, and
are next to one another.
</p>
<p>
Second, you can provide your own bootloader support in your application.
You can program the USB port to accept whatever data you want, and
do whatever you like with it. I'm assuming that if you have the 
knowledge to do this, you won't need to be reading this article, 
and I won't go into this approach in any more detail.
</p>
<p>
Third -- and this is the approach that most experimenters seem to
take -- you can use the built in break-to-bootloader support 
in the Arduino USB libraries. If you use the Arduino libraries to
provide a serial monitor on the USB port, for example, you'll
automatically get break-to-bootloader support in your application.
This support is provided by a library module <code>CDC.cpp</code>,
which is used by all the USB libraries.
</p>
<p>
The Arduino break-to-bootloader support is invoked by setting
the USB baud rate to 1200. When this happens, the application
code is stopped, and the board moves immediately to bootloader
mode. If the application itself was set up to perform its own
USB operations then, from the Linux host's point of view, the USB
is disconnected, then reconnected (perhaps as a different kind of 
device), which takes a little time.
</p>
<p>
I've found the following sequence of commands will reliably
put the Pro Micro into bootloader mode, preparatory to uploading code:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">$ stty -F <font color="#009900">$UPLOAD_DEV</font> speed <font color="#993399">1200</font>
$ sleep <font color="#993399">1</font>
$ stty -F <font color="#009900">$UPLOAD_DEV</font> speed <font color="#993399">57600</font>
$ sleep <font color="#993399">0.25</font>
$ avrdude <font color="#990000">....</font>
</pre>
<p>
Where Pro Micro users seem to come unstuck, however, is in
not realizing that this break-to-bootloader support only works
for applications that broadly comply with the Arduino programming
idiom, and are actually running properly. It definitely <i>won't</i>
work if you upload something to the board that is completely 
broken (e.g., compiled for the wrong device). Even in the absence
of such catastrophic failures, the break-to-bootloader support
won't work if it isn't compiled into your program. When you use the
Arduino IDE, this generally happens automatically; but when you're
free of the IDE's constraints, you'll have to make your own
provision -- which generally amounts to linking and initializing
the relevant library components. 
</p>
<p>
In short, you shouldn't rely on the software break-to-bootloader 
support always working -- you need a provision for a hardware
reset as well. 
</p>

<h2>A note about permissions</h2>
<p>
You won't need elevated permissions to build a program using the
compiler and binary conversion tools. However, you might need
some kind of elevated privileges to upload code to the board, 
using the USB port. In many Linux distributions, the relevant
entries in <code>/dev</code> are writeable by the <code>dialout</code>
group, so adding a user to that group is a reasonable way to 
secure the necessary access. Of course, you can also upload as
<code>root</code> if you prefer. You might also need to use
<code>root</code> for installing the necessary software tools, depending
on how your system is set up.
</p>

<h2>Collecting tools and preparing the environment</h2>
<p>
To build and upload C/C++ programs, you'll need at least the
following tools.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
The Arduino IDE. We won't use this to build or install code, but the IDE
provides a straightforward way to obtain the headers needed to support
specific boards. In addition, we can use the IDE to tell us which
particular settings and headers are needed to support a particular
board. These matters are hard to guess, and not well-documented.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The GCC C and C++ compilers for AVR devices. The executables will
usually be called <code>avr-gcc</code> and <code>avr-g++</code>. The
same tools supports a wide range of subtly different microcontroller
devices, and needs to be told which specific one to generate code
for. You'll need both C an C++ support if you want to use the 
Arduino libraries, as they use both languages.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The <code>avr-objcopy</code> utility. We'll use this to convert from
the ELF format that <code>gcc</code> produces, to the Intel Hex format
required by the board's bootloader.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The <code>avrdude</code> utility, for uploading the executable
to the board.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<code>gcc</code> headers specific to the Pro Micro device -- see
below for more on this point.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
In mainstream Linux distributions, you should be able to get all the
necessary software -- except the board-specific files -- in one
go by running
<code>apt-get install arduino</code> or <code>dnf install arduino</code>.
The total installation size is about 150Mb.
</p>

<p>
The final set-up step is to install the board-specific files. Of these
files, all we really need is the C headers, but I think it's still easiest
to get them using the Arduino IDE. Instructions for doing this are
on the
<a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pro-micro--fio-v3-hookup-guide/all" target="_blank">SparkFun website</a>.
Instructions for Linux are some way down this page, which is mostly
aimed at Windows users, but they're still reasonably comprehensive.
</p>
<p>
If you install the board-specific headers using the IDE, then they 
will end up in directory with a name like this:

<code>$HOME/.arduino15/packages/SparkFun/hardware/avr/1.1.13/variants/promicro</code>.
However, the name probably won't be exactly the same, and some searching may
be required to find the "promicro" directory.
</p>

<p>
In practice, the board-specific variant directory contains only one
file for the Pro Micro: <code>pins_arduino.h</code>. The other
content that gets downloaded controls compiler settings and macros.
We can use the IDE to see what those settings are, but we'll have
to make our own provision to use them when compiling manually.
</p>

<h2>Deploying a trivial example</h2>

<p>
In this section, I'll explain how to deploy the simplest working
example I can think of -- it just switches on the on-board 
transmit and receive LEDs. The example uses board-specific 
macros to do this, so we don't need to include any of the generic
Arduino headers. We do have to include the SparkFun board-specific
header <code>pins_arduino.h</code>, however.
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>Because this example uses no Arduino libraries, it won't provide any software break-to-bootloader support. So you'll need to provide a reset button to enable the bootloader, to experiment with this kind of code.</blockquote>

<p>
Here is the code, which I've saved in a file <code>blink_minimal.cpp</code>.
There's nothing in this source that requires C++, rather than C, but
code that uses the Arduino libraries (later) will usually need to be
C++.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#000080">#include</font></b> <font color="#FF0000">&lt;pins_arduino.h&gt;</font> <i><font color="#9A1900">// For LED macros</font></i>

<font color="#009900">int</font> <b><font color="#000000">main</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#009900">int</font> argc<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#009900">char</font> <font color="#990000">**</font>argv<font color="#990000">)</font>
  <font color="#FF0000">{</font>

  <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
</pre>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>We can use the Arduino "wiring" library to control the RX LED on the Pro Micro -- and will later. However, the Pro Micro does not have the TX LED on an Arduino-compatible GPIO pin, so that's always going to need a board-specific operation.</blockquote>

<p>
For ease of typing, set an environment variable to indicate where the
board-specific headers are:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">$ <font color="#009900">VARIANT_INCLUDE</font><font color="#990000">=</font><font color="#009900">$HOME</font>/arduino<font color="#993399">15</font>/packages/SparkFun<font color="#990000">/\</font>
hardware/avr<font color="#990000">/</font><font color="#993399">1.1</font><font color="#990000">.</font><font color="#993399">13</font>/variants/promicro
</pre>
<p>
The directory noted above is where the Arduino IDE installed these
headers. The exact location is unimportant, so long as you tell the
compiler where they are.
</p>

<p>
Compile and link the program to an ELF binary, indicating the location
of the board-specific headers:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">$ avr-g<font color="#990000">++</font> -I <font color="#009900">$VARIANT_INCLUDE</font> -mmcu<font color="#990000">=</font>atmega32u4 -Os -Wall <font color="#990000">\</font>
      -o blink_minimal<font color="#990000">.</font>elf blink_minimal<font color="#990000">.</font>cpp 
</pre>
<p>
In this command, <code>-Os</code> means 'optimize for size'; we'll 
use this switch all the time, but it hardly matters in this trivial example.
<code>-mmcu</code> identifies the specific AVR sub-type we're compiling
for. The <code>avr-g++</code> command compiles the C++ source, and
produces an executable in ELF format -- the format generally used
for Linux binaries.
</p>
<p>
Convert the ELF binary into a Intel Hex file suitable for
uploading to the Pro Micro board:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">$ avr-objcopy -O ihex -R <font color="#990000">.</font>eeprom blink_minimal<font color="#990000">.</font>elf  blink_minimal<font color="#990000">.</font>hex
</pre>
<p>
Now upload the <code>.hex</code> file to the board using <code>avrdude</code>. In order to do this, we need the board in bootloader mode. If this
isn't a brand-new board, you'll need to effect this manually
-- see the section "A note about USB operating modes (and how to enable bootloader mode)" above. You'll probably need to use the hardware reset 
button, and be aware that the Pro Micro's USB port will only
stay in bootloader mode for a few seconds, so speed is of the essence.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">$ avrdude -v -p atmega32u4 -c avr109 -P /dev/ttyACM<font color="#993399">0</font> -b<font color="#993399">57600</font> <font color="#990000">\</font>
    -D -Uflash<font color="#990000">:</font>w<font color="#990000">:</font>blink_minimal<font color="#990000">.</font>hex<font color="#990000">:</font>i
</pre>

<p>
If everything has gone according to plan, you should be rewarded by seeing
the TX and RX LEDs turn on (along with the power LED).
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, while uploading a substantial program can be time-consuming,
uploading the few hundred bytes of this trivial sample should not
take more than a fraction of a second. If it seems to be taking
longer than this, something is wrong. 
</p>

<h2>Deploying a trivial example that uses Arduino libraries</h2>
<p>
This is where things get significantly more complicated and where,
in practice, you'll need a script or a Makefile to automate the
steps -- there's just too much to do, to do it manually at the
prompt.
</p>
<p>
The program I'm using for demonstration purposes appears only 
slightly more complicated 
than the previous example. However, it uses the USB port to provide
debugging messages, and that means we need to use the Arduino
libraries (or write an awful lot of code from scratch). 
Here is the code, in <code>blink.cpp</code>.
</p>
<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#000080">#include</font></b> <font color="#FF0000">&lt;Arduino.h&gt;</font>

  <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
</pre>

<p>
This code differs from the previous, trivial example in three important
ways.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
It writes to the USB port, using the standard <code>Serial</code> class. 
</p></li>
<li><p>
It uses the "wiring" library to control the receive LED, and to
generate timed delays.
</p></li>
<li><p>
It uses the <code>main()</code> function provided by the Arduino library.
This standard function calls our <code>setup()</code> once, and then
<code>loop()</code> repeatedly. Before calling <code>setup()</code> it
does some important initialization. Between calls to <code>loop()</code>
it flushes USB data that is waiting. These additional steps are 
important in a program that uses USB.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that, by including the stock USB libraries, we automatically
get software break-to-bootloader support, as I described above.
</p>
<p>
The first decision to make is how we are to manage the Arduino
libraries (which, as I've said, have to be compiled into the application).
I can think of two general approaches.
</p>
<p>
First, we could pick out the relevant source and header files from
the basic Arduino package, and copy them into the application along
with the application's own sources. For simplicity we could
just copy the library files into the same directory as the application
sources. The problem with this approach is in code management --
our application will contain a large number of files that aren't
part of the application in any a proprietorial sense. When I push
my code to a repository like GitHub, I don't want to push a heap of
somebody else's code. There are ways around this problem, but not
elegant ones.
</p>
<p>
Second, we could leave the library components where they are initially
installed, and just compile them into object files in 
the program's working directory
as part of the build. That's the approach I've adopted for this 
example. However, I should point out that, the more libraries you
collect from various places -- and all will be in source form --
the easier it gets just to copy the components into the program's
own source. 
</p>
<p>
However the Arduino libraries are managed, compiling them is much 
the same as compiling the application sources -- except that
the library sources expect specific compiler macros to be set.
</p>
<p>
Here's how to compile the standard <code>USBCore</code> module, which
(in my version of the Arduino distribution) is provided as C++.
</p>
<p>
First, for ease of reading, lets define environment variables for
the locations of the standard Arduino components, and for the 
board-specific headers:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">$ <font color="#009900">VARIANT_INCLUDE</font><font color="#990000">=</font><font color="#009900">$HOME</font>/arduino<font color="#993399">15</font>/packages/SparkFun<font color="#990000">/\</font>
hardware/avr<font color="#990000">/</font><font color="#993399">1.1</font><font color="#990000">.</font><font color="#993399">13</font>/variants/promicro
$ <font color="#009900">INCLUDE</font><font color="#990000">=</font>/usr/share/arduino/hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino
</pre>

<p>
Then we compile like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">$ avr-g<font color="#990000">++</font> -Os -Wall -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -mmcu<font color="#990000">=</font>atmega32u4 <font color="#990000">\</font>
    -DF<font color="#009900">_CPU</font><font color="#990000">=</font><font color="#993399">16000000</font> -DUSB<font color="#009900">_VID</font><font color="#990000">=</font><font color="#993399">0x1bf4</font> -DUSB<font color="#009900">_PID</font><font color="#990000">=</font><font color="#993399">0x9204</font> <font color="#990000">\</font>
    -fno-exceptions -fno-threadsafe-statics 
    -I <font color="#009900">$VARIANT_INCLUDE</font> -I <font color="#009900">$INCLUDE</font> -c -o USBCore<font color="#990000">.</font>o <font color="#009900">$INCLUDE</font>/USBCore<font color="#990000">.</font>cpp
</pre>

<p>
Some of these compiler switches are likely to be unfamiliar.
</p>
<p>
<code>-ffunction-sections</code> and <code>-fdata-sections</code> 
instruct the compiler to use a different section in the object file for
each function and data block. This is important for size-optimization,
because the linker can remove the sections that aren't referenced. 
This means that C functions that are in the library sources, but never
actually used, don't get included in the final build.
</p>
<p>
<code>-fno-exceptions</code> and <code>-fno-threadsafe-statics</code>
prevent the inclusion of code that is unlikely to be used in a microcontroller program.
</p>
<p>
<code>-DF_CPU</code> defines the microcontroller clock speed in Hz.
The Pro Micro has a 16MHz clock. This definition is used in many
of the library sources. For example, it's used in the <code>delay()</code>
function to calculate timing values. 
</p>
<p>
<code>-DUSB_VID</code> and <code>-DUSB_PID</code> set the vendor and
product IDs of the USB device <i>when the user application is running</i>.
These values are used by the USB modules in the library. The values 
I'm using here are the same as those used by the Pro Micro bootloader,
so the board will appear as the same device whether it's running an
application or in bootloader mode. That's the right thing to do here,
because the communication of textual diagnostic data isn't different
in principle from the communication used by the bootloader -- both
are modem-like. However, 
if you're implementing a custom USB device, you'd probably want to
provide you own vendor/product IDs.
</p>
<p>
None of this discussion addresses the problem of which library modules
to include. You can't accidentally forget one -- the application won't
link. But knowing which modules implement which functions and classes
isn't straightforward. There are, I think, three ways to approach
this problem: experience, trial-and-error, and cheating using the IDE.
</p>
<p>
While I won't be using the IDE for actual development, it <i>is</i>
handy for figuring out which libraries to include. All we have to do
is write the most trivial possible program that uses the relevant
functions and classes (it doesn't actually have to work), and see
what compilation commands the IDE emits. You can, in fact, include
<i>all</i> the library modules, and rely on the linker to remove
the parts that aren't actually used. On a modern Linux system,
compiling the entire Arduino library only takes a few seconds.
This isn't very elegant but, in practice, a substantial Arduino program
might use a majority of code in the standard library anyway.
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>Annoyingly, some of the library modules are written in C and some in C++. You can't use exactly the same compiler switches for both languages, because some make sense only for C and others for C++.</blockquote>
<p>
Linking amounts to the following:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">$ avr-gcc -w -Os -flto -fuse-linker-plugin <font color="#990000">\</font>
      -Wl<font color="#990000">,</font>--gc-sections -mmcu<font color="#990000">=</font>atmega32u4 -o blink<font color="#990000">.</font>elf <font color="#990000">\</font>
      source1<font color="#990000">.</font>o source2<font color="#990000">.</font>o<font color="#990000">....</font>
</pre>

<p>
<code>-flto</code> and <code>-fuse-linker-plugin</code> both
contribute to link-time optimization (LTO), and their use is somewhat
disputed. It won't break the program to leave these out, or to experiment
to see which gives the smallest binary.
</p>
<p>
<code>-Wl,--gc-sections</code> tells the linker to remove any 
sections that are not referenced by other sections. In conjunction
with the compiler settings, this setting is crucial for minimizing
the executable size.
</p>
<p>
The resulting ELF file can be converted into a hex file, 
and uploaded to the board,  as described for the simpler example above.
</p>
<p>
The source code bundle contains a Makefile that automates all these
steps. All being well, this example should provide for break-to-bootloader
support, so you can deploy without needed to double-tap the reset
button every time.
</p>
<p>
When the program is running, the Pro Micro will function as a 
USB modem (as it does when running the bootloader). However, the process
of switching the USB port from bootloader mode to application mode
takes a little time -- as much as ten seconds. So, while we should
be able to see the diagnostic output of the Pro Micro program just
by doing <code>cat /dev/ttyACM0</code> (or whatever device is allocated),
it might take some time for this to happen. This limitation is documented,
and isn't considered a defect.
</p>


<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
It's pretty clear that the Arduino libraries were never designed to be
integrated into a standard Linux toolchain. Creating a Makefile to
build even a simple application is a whole lot more complicated than
it ought to be. Once the Makefile is set up, 
building and deploying a program is a one-command operation, and
doesn't require you to follow the code structure imposed by the IDE.
That, alone, is a good reason for getting to grips with command-based
building.
</p>
<p>
A number of developers have published general-purpose Makefiles for
handling Arduino sketches. While these can work, I'm not convinced
that it's possible to get the best out of them unless you understand
the low-level operations involved in the build process.
