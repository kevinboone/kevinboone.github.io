<h1 id="two-years-without-google-et-al.-has-it-been-worth-it">Two years
without Google, et al. – has it been worth it?</h1>
<p><img src="img/degoogle.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>Back in the summer of 2023, I decided it was time to remove myself
from the surveillance economy, and stop being a product of the
advertising industry. That meant making a conscious effort to avoid all
on-line services that harvest personal data, including, but not limited
to, all Google services. It also meant abandoning mainstream smartphone
platforms like iOS and any vendor’s version of Android. Even with an
open-source version of Android on my cellphone, it meant giving up most
commercial apps.</p>
<p>In this article, I outline the changes I’ve seen in the de-Googling
world over the last couple of years, both for good and for ill.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note</em><br />
I should point out that I’ve never really used Microsoft Windows and,
while I’ve read about worrying changes to its advertising and telemetry
policies, I can’t really comment on them. Windows users have an
additional need for caution.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2
id="whats-changed-installing-a-non-vendor-operating-system-on-a-cellphone">What’s
changed – installing a non-vendor operating system on a cellphone</h2>
<p>Back in 2023 I reported that it was difficult – unnecessarily
difficult – to install an open-source operating system like Lineage OS
or /e/OS on a modern smartphone. This situation has mostly not improved:
it’s still a bear. In some senses it’s gotten worse: <a
href="samsung-no-more-lineage.html">the demise of 2G and 3G network
services now excludes Samsung handsets from effective
de-Googling</a>.</p>
<p>What’s changed, however, is my level of skill. In the last two years
I’ve de-Googled many smartphones and tablets. I have all the software
tools I need, and I know how to use them. I can install Lineage OS on a
phone, test it, and reinstall the vendor firmware if necessary in less
than an hour.</p>
<p>I’ve learned how to root various brands of cellphone, because this
process uses similar tools to the ones we use for flashing new firmware.
Being able to root the device is helpful even if you’re not installing a
new operating system, because it provides access to a more comprehensive
level of de-bloating than regular end-user tools.</p>
<p>In my efforts to make things work, I’ve learned a lot more about
telephony than I ever wanted to. I now know what ‘VoLTE’ is, and why it
matters, for example.</p>
<p>Another thing I’ve learned, to my horror, is that Google is far from
the most avid data siphon in the industry. The amount of data-gathering
cruft in Samsung’s Android implementation is simply staggering.</p>
<h2 id="whats-changed-the-de-googled-marketplace">What’s changed – the
de-Googled marketplace</h2>
<p>It’s always been possible to buy a de-Googled phone from an on-line
auction site, but since 2023 I’ve noticed a number of more substantial
vendors joining in the game. What’s for sale is mostly refurbished
Google Pixels two to three years old, running either /e/OS or Graphene.
Ironically, the Google handsets are pretty easy to de-Google. For the
easiest Google-free experience, you could consider the <a
href="https://murena.com/">Murena</a> ecosystem, which includes
de-Googled handsets and the services to back them. It’s an interesting
approach and, while I prefer to set everything up myself, not everybody
is as geeky as me.</p>
<h2 id="whats-changed-mapping-and-navigation">What’s changed – mapping
and navigation</h2>
<p>Back in 2023, I said there was no viable alternative to Google Maps.
Sadly, that remains the case. The nearest I’ve found is <a
href="https://www.magicearth.com/">Magic Earth</a>, whose app can be
installed on de-Googled cellphones, and which works very well. It’s a
subscription service though and, while I’m happy to pay for what I use,
the supplier doesn’t provide any way to pay except through Google’s
payment framework. So, when I tried Magic Earth, I had a tantalizing
one-month free trial to see how good it was, before finding I could no
longer use it. I’m told that alternative payment methods are under
investigation. In the meantime, I’m using OpenStreeMap as I was in 2023,
and it has all the same limitations.</p>
<p>In 2023 I lamented the demise of the ViewRanger topographical mapping
application, and its replacement with OutdoorActive. I’m happy to report
that OA is now pretty useable and, although I don’t like all the add-on
social media features it offers, it still does mapping pretty well, even
offline. It’s a paid app which is, again, fine – but the vendor’s
payment policies are more flexible than those of Magic Earth.</p>
<h2 id="whats-changed-email-and-pda-services">What’s changed – email and
PDA services</h2>
<p>Since 2023, a number of new email and PDA services have come on-line,
or become mature enough to use. Back then I decided to use FastMail
because, frankly, there wasn’t much of an alternative. Now we have new
offerings from Proton, tuta, Murena, Posteo, and probably others. I
compared some of these offerings in <a href="fastmail.html">an earlier
article</a>.</p>
<p>In 2023 I complained about how fiddly it was to integrate FastMail’s
calendar, contacts, and file management with the Android infrastructure.
I’m pleased to report that this is no longer the case. I still use DavX5
as the synchronizer, but it now has built-in configuration for
FastMail’s services. So does the K-9 (now Thunderbird) email client.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could opt for Murena’s integrated services, which
seem to be as seamless and convenient as Google’s, but without the
privacy concerns. Of course, you’ll have to pay for these services, but
they aren’t expensive.</p>
<p>On the whole, using a de-Googled smartphone for routine communication
and PDA tasks has gotten quite a bit easier since 2023.</p>
<h2 id="whats-changed-over-reliance-on-apps">What’s changed –
over-reliance on apps</h2>
<p>I complained in 2023, and have continued to complain, about how many
public services have become reliant on apps. Even the gym I frequent has
stopped using physical membership cards, in favour of having everybody
sign in using an app. Happily, all the staff there know me, and my
applessness (is that a word?) isn’t a big deal. When there’s no way to
exercise indoors without using an app, I guess I shall have to do more
outdoors, and invest in an umbrella if necessary.</p>
<p>I was worried in 2023 about the number of concert and entertainment
venues, and car parks, requiring the use of apps. The National Health
Service repeatedly sends me messages extolling the virtues of its app
but, so far, I haven’t been refused medical treatment without it. I’m
pleased to report that, although the situation remains lamentable, it
doesn’t seem to have deteriorated in the last couple of years, which is
a relief.</p>
<h2 id="whats-changed-open-source-apps">What’s changed – open-source
apps</h2>
<p>The number of serviceable apps that are completely open-source, and
available without access to Google services, has continued to increase.
There’s no problem finding good-quality apps for email, scheduling,
note-taking, media playback, all kinds of messaging, word processing,
drawing, spreadsheets, and so on. When you’re divorced from Google,
you’ll have to find ways to back up or synchronize all the information
these apps manage, of course. That’s not necessarily a disadvantage:
apps that were written to be independent of cloud services will operate
quite happily on locally-stored data. Yes, you have to look after your
data, but at least you’ll still have it during a service outage.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that the open-source apps are as good as their
commercial equivalents, or that they even exist. There still isn’t an
open-source handwriting recognition app. There isn’t an open-source
mapping app as good as Google maps, a music player as good as USB Player
Pro, or an audiobook app as good as Smart Audiobook Player.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the open-source VLC is a better video player than
anything you can buy. YouTube clients like NewPipe and Tubular are far
better than the official YouTube app. These are positive developments,
and I expect them to continue.</p>
<h2 id="whats-changed-closed-source-apps">What’s changed – closed-source
apps</h2>
<p>It’s become much easier to run closed-source apps without Google
services since 2023. Mostly, I think, this is because of the increased
sophistication of Google service stubs like MicroG. These stubs fool
apps into thinking that Google services are available and, in fact, can
register with Google servers in a somewhat anonymous way.</p>
<p>On-line banking and payment apps, in particular, have always been
fussy about the handsets they’re prepared to run on, and that hasn’t
changed. There continues to be a kind of arms race between the banks and
the de-Googlers, with the banks finding increasingly clever ways to
determine whether a cellphone has been de-Googled, and the de-Googlers
finding increasingly clever ways to fool the apps. The situation remains
fluid, and it’s difficult to ensure that any specific app will work on a
de-Googled phone.</p>
<p>If you buy a pre-de-Googled phone, it will almost certainly have
MicroG installed. Many users want the convenience of access to the
Google Play Store, as well as an ability to run for-payment apps. I had
mixed feelings about this in 2023, and I continue to have concerns. On
the one hand, it irks me that I can no longer use apps that I’ve
actually paid for. On the other, I don’t know how anonymous MicroG’s
communication with Google can really be, especially when payments are
involved. Right now, I’m only using apps that don’t require MicroG and
the like, most of which are open-source.</p>
<p>The problem with closed-source apps, apart from the almost inevitable
privacy concerns with Google, is that they could be leaking your data to
<em>more-or-less anybody</em>. Some apps are pretty open about this, but
some are distinctly shady.</p>
<h2 id="whats-changed-sideloading">What’s changed – ‘sideloading’</h2>
<p>Google recently announced, to a barrage of disapproval, that upcoming
versions of Android would not allow software to be installed except via
channels it controls. I don’t expect this to affect de-Googled phones,
so I don’t think it’s a concern for the de-Googling community. It’s a
pain in the butt for the users of regular Android, of course.</p>
<h2 id="whats-changed-public-perception">What’s changed – public
perception</h2>
<p>So far as I can see, nothing much has changed here. Those of us who
eschew surveillance capitalism tend to be seen as tinfoil-hatters and,
of the few people who actually understand the issues, many seem to feel
the battle is lost. The sentiment I hear most often is: everybody
already has all my personal data, what <em>more</em> is there to worry
about?</p>
<p>That’s a fair point, I think. Another is that even if I do what I
think is the right thing by de-Googling, I’m surrounded by people who
are still in Google’s thrall, so the tech behemoths are still sucking up
my private information indirectly.</p>
<h2 id="was-it-worth-it-should-you-do-it">Was it worth it? Should you do
it?</h2>
<p>Living a Google-free life requires a fair amount of research and
experimentation, and a willingness to make compromises. It also means
paying for things that you didn’t pay for in the past; to be fair,
though, the expense will be minimal for most people.</p>
<p>If you use commercial and closed-source apps – especially the
heavy-hitters like Instagram, WhatsApp, and YouTube – I don’t know that
you’d get much out of de-Googling. If you’re using those apps, you’ve
already tacitly agreed to having your personal data slurped up by the
app, regardless of what the platform does. De-Googling will be like
worrying about your sunburn when your house is on fire.</p>
<p>I’m prepared to continue on this adventure because I’m a nerd, and I
enjoy tinkering with technology. I find that I <em>can</em> live
Google-free (and Samsung-free, and all the rest of them) without too
much hardship. On a trivial level, I find that I don’t need phone
vendors’ AI to edit my photos to remove acne and nasal hair – that’s
what Photoshop is for. I don’t need my email messages sent off to some
remote server to have my writing checked for run-on sentences, I’ll run
on my sentences if I damn well please. Oh, look: I just did. More
seriously, I continue to miss Google Maps, and Samsung’s excellent
handwriting recognition, but I can live without them.</p>
<p>But should I? Should you?</p>
<p>Google and the other tech giants are turning the world into a giant
telemetry platform, and using it to support a massive advertising
industry. Some of the telemetry data goes to distinctly shady operators,
in places with no respect for human rights. What they do with that data,
nobody knows but them.</p>
<p>For me, these are points of sufficient concern that I’m willing to
tolerate the modest inconvenience of de-Googling. I’m aware of course,
that not everybody has the same priorities, and not everybody has spent
a lifetime in the IT industry. De-Googling will be difficult for many
people, and inconvenient for almost all.</p>
<p>And, in the end, it might already be too late. I’m well aware that my
token efforts to preserve the last vestiges of privacy will have little
impact. Nevertheless, I am encouraged by the words of 19th-century
clergyman Sidney Smith:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the greatest of all mistakes to do nothing because you can only
do little.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I will continue to do a little, even if I do it alone.</p>
