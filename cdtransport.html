<h1>Do different CD transports sound different?</h1>
<p>

</p>

<p>
I've recently decided to upgrade the audio system in my home office --
after all, I now spend an awful lot of time there. For years I've
had a Denon all-in-one system which, to be fair, sounds pretty good.
Still, there's room for improvement -- especially in the headphone
output.
</p>
<p>
So I was wondering what I might use to play CDs 
until I get a new player/transport. Like many people of my generation, 
I have thousands of CDs, and I still want to play them. It occurred to
me that I could use my XBox which, after all, has a CD slot and some
(awful) software to play CDs. Although this does work, it doesn't sound
wonderful -- the new equipment has revealed just how non-wonderful it
actually is. The audio output from other sources on the XBox sounds
just fine -- it's just CD playback that is unsatisfactory. 
</p>
<p>
The XBox has an optical digital audio output, which I've connected to my 
new DAC. So (I reasoned) I'm just playing a stream of bits. 
A bit is a bit, isn't it? Why should this form of playback sound so awful?
</p>
<p>
This question led me -- once again -- down the audiophile rat-hole.
There's no doubt that people with more money than sense are willing to
hear a difference between one CD transport and another, despite a lack
of credible science to back up such an effect. I'm a fairly fussy
listener -- even in my office -- and I don't mind paying more for a
better result. But does spending more actually get a better result?
And how much better? 
</p>
<p>
I should point out that I'm talking about CD <i>transports</i> here,
not CD players. A transport just has a digital output
to the DAC, while a <i>player</i> will have a DAC of its own.
There's no question that different CD players, with their own DACs,
sound different. But, bits being bits, different transports should not
really sound different.
</p>
<p>
I also have to point out that I'm assuming good source material --
CDs in good physical condition. There's no doubt that some CD transports
deal with defective, scratched CDs better than others. Even the humble
XBox can play scratched CDs that my old Denon spits out -- that's just
the result of ten year's technological development between the two. 
I'm really interested
in whether one CD transport sounds better than another, with CDs that
are in good condition. 
</p>
<p>
The usual explanation why one CD transport might sound better than
another is <i>jitter</i>. The problem, you see, is that 
the S/PDIF interface usually used to connect a CD transport to a DAC
is inherently <i>synchronous</i>. It is, after all, an old technology.
The rate at which data is sent by the CD to the DAC essentially sets 
the sampling
rate of the DAC, on an instant-by-instant basis. "Jitter" is timing errors
in the process of digital to analog conversion. Jitter may arise 
because of inherent limitations in the DAC (which the CD transport
can't do anything about), or because of timing errors in the way the
data is collected and transmitted. 
</p>
<p>
In a CD transport, jitter might arise because the rate at which data
is read from the disk is not constant, or because the data is not
clocked out to the DAC accurately. Reading a CD is not a trivial 
task -- it requires highly accurate placement of the scanning laser,
and the ability to correct errors in real time, whilst maintaining a
constant data flow. Nevertheless, we do have the technology to do this,
very effectively, and at reasonably low cost. Whatever jitter is present,
we expect it to be small, even with relatively inexpensive equipment. 
</p>
<p>
This raises the question -- how large must jitter be, to be audible?
This isn't an easy question to answer. Jitter doesn't sound like 
noise, or even like regular harmonic distortion. The effect of jitter
is most detectable (with measuring instruments) on signals that are
slewing quickly. This might be because the audio waveform is of
large amplitude, or of high frequency, or both. It's reasonable to
assume, therefore, that its effects will be subtle, and hard to describe.
</p>
<p>
It's only in the last few years that we've started to analyse and
quantify the jitter in CD transports in a reasonably scientific 
way. The phenomenon is certainly there, and it differs between
transports.
</p>
<p>
So -- jitter is a real thing, and different CD transports experience
different amounts of it. Therefore, different CD transports sound
different. Case closed.
</p>
<p>
Not so fast. It turns out that modern DACs -- at least those of reasonable
quality -- will reconstruct a stable clock signal from a potentially
jittery input source. To some extent, they <i>must</i> do this, because
DACs have to buffer at least enough incoming data to form a 16-bit
word (because CDs use a 16-bit sampling process). So the rate at which
bits are turned into voltages by the DAC is not directly related to the
stability of the transport's clock and motor.  
</p>
<p>
Moreover, decent DAC have greater buffering capacity than 16 bits. Many
can buffer for a second or more. With this amount of buffering, the
connection between the CD transport's clock, and the DAC's output, 
is essentially broken. So long as there isn't enough jitter to drop
a whole bit -- which would be hugely audible -- the transport is
effectively decoupled from the audio output.
</p>
<p>
In such a situation, if jitter plays any part in sound quality, it
will be the jitter in the DAC's clock, not the CD transport.
</p>
<p>
I concede that we don't actually know how audible jitter is. It's at
least plausible that it is audible to some extent, if it is not
corrected. It's also plausible -- perhaps inevitable -- that jitter
behaviour varies between CD transports. However, a competent DAC
ought to be able to eliminate the effects of jitter on the incoming
data completely. There's really no reason to expect different
CD transports to sound different with a reasonable, modern DAC. And,
if your DAC is incompetent, then jitter in your CD transport is probably
a lesser problem. 
</p>
<p>
So -- stupidly-expensive CD transports are, in fact, snake oil, as so
much is in the hi-fi world. That does leave unanswered the question why
my XBox makes such a poor CD transport.
</p>
<p>
The explanation, I believe, is that it isn't acting as a transport at
all. That is, the XBox is not simply reading bits from the CD and sending
them to its S/PDIF output. I know this is the case, because the XBox 
mixes the CD's audio with other sound sources. I suspect that the XBox is
actually resampling the CD audio, to make it possible to do this mixing.
It's certainly possible to resample audio in a way that is essentially
inaudible, but it's also possible to implement resampling badly. 
</p>
<p>
As ever, technical knowledge is the best defence against the snake-oil
salesman.
