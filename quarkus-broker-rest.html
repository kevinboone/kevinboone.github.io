<h1>Using Quarkus to provide a REST interface to a message broker</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/quarkus_logo.png" 
  alt="Quarkus logo"/>
Middleware message brokers usually use specific protocols for communication
with their clients. AMQP and MQTT are common non-proprietary protocols,
but most products have proprietary protocols as well. A problem with
all these protocols is that they are not HTTP. Firewalls, proxies, and
routers are generally well-adapted to HTTP, and usually to little else.
So, while it's no problem to run a message broker on the same
network as the applications that use it, problems related to network
routing and access control arise when they
are on distinct networks. With the rise of hybrid 
cloud installations, software components in the same application 
are on different networks as
often as not.
</p>
<p>
The STOMP messaging protocol is HTTP-like, and can sometimes be handled
like HTTP. Usually, though, what integrators are looking for is a way
to interoperate with message brokers using <i>real</i> HTTP.
Since it's now very popular, integrators usually ask for a 
REST-style interface, where the request URL indicates the action
to be performed, and the HTTP request and response bodies carry
the data for the request.
This means that we need, as a minimum, a way to send an HTTP request that 
produces a message to a broker, and a request that consumes a message
from a broker. That's the minimum functionality; a lot more 
could be provided -- and that's why there's a problem. 
</p>
<p>
The classic version of <a href="https://activemq.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache ActiveMQ</a> (5.x) has a REST interface -- at least for
demonstration purposes -- but the more recent 'Artemis' version 
does not. The Artemis maintainers do not seem keen to provide this
functionality, and there's a good reason, which I'll describe shortly.
In reality, developers or integrators who want to provide
REST-style access to their message brokers really need to implement
it themselves. In this article I will describe a simple way to
do that, using an application for the Camel extension for Quarkus.
I'll show that the basic functionality -- send and receive messages
-- can be implemented in about twenty lines of Java, using this
platform. Of course, a production-quality application might need
more than this.
</p>
<p>
In this article I will describe my simple implementation, but first
I'll explain why it's more complicated than it might first appear for
the broker vendor to do this in a generic way.
</p>

<h2>What a REST interface to a broker might look like</h2>
<p>
In the simplest case, we might receive the next message available
on a specified queue <i>my_queue</i> by issuing an HTTP GET request with
a URL like this:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
/broker/consume/my_queue
</pre>
<p>
The interface might provide the message body just as a stream of raw 
data, or it might wrap it in some other format (JSON is popular).
In the REST paradigm, GET requests are usual for retrieving data
without changing anything. However, there's no reason why a POST
request could not be used.
</p>
<p>
To send a message to the broker, we might issue a POST request of this
form:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
/broker/produce/my_queue
</pre>
<p>
POST is appropriate here, both because we're changing the data on the
target server, and because we will use the request body to carry
the message that is to be stored on the broker. As with retrieving
the message, we might just send the raw message body, or wrap it
up in some other format. 
</p>
<p>
We could use the HTTP <code>Content-Type</code> header to indicate the
type of the data that is to be stored or retrieved; but most message 
brokers recognize a very limited number of types (typically text and
binary).
</p>

<h2>Why not a generic REST interface?</h2>
<p>
Message brokers typically don't provide a generic HTTP interface,
although a few do. One reason for this is that operations on message brokers
are often more complex than HTTP interactions. HTTP is a very simple
protocol, designed for situations where a single request is completely
self-contained and stateless. 
</p>
<p>
Messaging protocols, however, have notions of connection, session, and
address, all with different lifetimes. Typically they have mechanisms
for flow control and read-ahead which can be used to fine-tune data 
transfer speeds.
</p>
<p>
These protocol differences raise a number of questions. For example, 
should the HTTP interface
maintain long-lived connections to the message broker, or create them
according to demand from its own clients? What about sessions -- if these are
distinct from connections, should the
interface maintain a pool of session? And if so, how large should it
be? How will the interface deal with the distinction between 
persistent and non-persistent messaging? Message batches? Setting
custom headers? How should data flow be regulated? How
should the system handle errors? If multiple HTTP clients connect to the 
same address on the same message broker, should the clients share
the messages, or receive their own copies?
</p>
<p>
These questions are easy to answer in a <i>specific</i> application, 
but it is difficult to provide a general approach that will work
with all applications. If we try to provide a general-purpose
interface, most likely it will be so complex that developing clients
will be very burdensome.
</p>
<p>
There's another, more subtle, reason why message brokers typically don't provide
an HTTP interface of their own -- other than (sometimes) for
administration. The HTTP interface
will amount to a web server, which will create its own load on the
broker when it is used by HTTP clients. This load will typically be 
of a different level, and often
of a completely different kind, from the load created by clients using
messaging protocols. Having these two kinds of load in the same process
makes it difficult to scale the installation properly. 
</p>
<p>
In this article I'll show how easy it is to provide an HTTP interface
to a message broker using Quarkus. My simple application requires only
about twenty lines of Java. If a real application needed ten times as
much code, that would still be relatively straightforward. There's
no magic here -- the Quarks and Camel libraries consists of
<i>millions</i> of lines of code. This code just happens to be very
appropriate for integration tasks.
</p>


<h2>Quarkus and Camel</h2>
<p>
The <a href="https://quarkus.io" target="_blank">Quarkus framework</a> is
a Java development platform with many similarities to Spring Boot --
it is a highly opinionated framework, well-suited for doing the kinds
of things that are typically done in the middleware world. An interesting
feature is that it is based on libraries that can be compiled to
native executable code, rather than Java bytecode. The use of native
code leads to very rapid start-up times, which can be important in
cloud environments.  
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://camel.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Camel</a> is
an integration toolkit for Java, that provides a language for
managing communication between many different systems with many 
different protocols. Naturally, HTTP/HTTPS is supported, as is
the AMQP messaging protocol. However, there are hundreds of other
components. At the time of writing, not all are supported on
Quarkus, but the ones we need for this application are.
</p>

<h2>The REST interface application</h2>
<p>
The full source of the application <code>quarkus-broker-rest</code> 
is available 
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/quarkus-broker-rest">in my GitHub repository</a>. Although there's not much to it,
only about twenty lines are relevant to the specific application -- the
rest are boilerplate. The boilerplate code -- like the Maven
<code>pom.xml</code> that controls the build process -- is often
generated using tools or archetypes.
</p>
<p>
The source bundle also includes a document explaining how to
build the application, and test it using a message broker and the
<code>curl</code> utility.
</p>
<p>
The application consists of a Camel <i>route</i> (integration flow), 
which starts like this:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#000000">rest</font></b><font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#FF0000">"/broker/produce/{queue}"</font><font color="#990000">)</font>
  <font color="#990000">.</font><b><font color="#000000">post</font></b><font color="#990000">()</font>
  <font color="#990000">.</font><b><font color="#000000">to</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#FF0000">"direct:produce"</font><font color="#990000">);</font>

<font color="#990000">.</font><b><font color="#000000">rest</font></b><font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#FF0000">"/broker/consume/{queue}"</font><font color="#990000">)</font>
  <font color="#990000">.</font><b><font color="#000000">get</font></b><font color="#990000">()</font>
  <font color="#990000">.</font><b><font color="#000000">to</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#FF0000">"direct:consume"</font><font color="#990000">);</font>
</pre>

<p>
These calls set up two REST endpoints -- the first for sending
messages, and the second for receiving. The token <code>{queue}</code>
indicates that the client will supply a queue name here, as part
of the URL, which will end up
stored in Camel as a named parameter <code>header.queue</code> (more
on this later). The calls <code>post()</code> and <code>get()</code>
indicate that the endpoints respond to POST and GET requests.
These endpoints forward requests to two other endpoints, called
<code>produce</code> and <code>consume</code>. <code>produce</code>
is defined like this:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#000000">from</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#FF0000">"direct:produce"</font><font color="#990000">)</font>
  <font color="#990000">.</font><b><font color="#000000">toD</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#FF0000">"amqp:queue:${header.queue}?disableReplyTo=true&amp;jmsMessageType=Text"</font><font color="#990000">)</font>
  <font color="#990000">.</font><b><font color="#000000">setBody</font></b><font color="#990000">().</font><b><font color="#000000">constant</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#FF0000">"OK</font><font color="#CC33CC">\r\n</font><font color="#FF0000">"</font><font color="#990000">);</font>
</pre>
<p>
The Camel <code>amqp</code> endpoint defines a connection to a message
broker; the broker's hostname, port, etc., are defined in a configuration
file. Note that <code>${header.name}</code> substitutes the broker queue
name, that was provided in the client's URL. We need 
<code>disableReplyTo</code> here because Camel will not wait for a 
response from the broker (apart from its basic acknowledgement). Once the
client has sent its message, it's finished.
</p>
<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>Camel note: We need <code>toD</code> here, rather than <code>to</code> because the <code>amqp</code> endpoint has a value that is substituted at runtime. Camel is more efficient if all the endpoint parameters are static, but that's not the case here</blockquote>
<p>
The <code>consume</code> endpoint is a bit more complicated:
</p>
<p>
<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#000000">from</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#FF0000">"direct:consume"</font><font color="#990000">)</font>
      <font color="#990000">.</font><b><font color="#000000">pollEnrich</font></b><font color="#990000">()</font>
      <font color="#990000">.</font><b><font color="#000000">simple</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#FF0000">"amqp:queue:${header.queue}?disableReplyTo=true"</font><font color="#990000">);</font>
</pre>
<p>
<code>pollEnrich()</code> indicates that, when this endpoint
is invoked (when an HTTP request has been received) Camel will 
wait, whilst it issues another request. This further request is
to consume from the message broker -- again using the
<code>ampq</code> endpoint. The message retrieved from the broker
is not processed in any way, so eventually it just finds its way
back to the HTTP client, in the form of a response body.
</p>
<p>
To be fair, I should point out that I have not show the exception
handling -- but this only adds five lines of code. So 
I have implemented the complete REST interface to the
broker using only twenty lines of Java. Apart from the exception
handling and the <code>pom.xml</code> build specification, 
what I've shown is <i>the complete application</i>.
</p>

<h2>Testing the application</h2>
<p>
Build the application using <code>mvn package</code>. This creates
a self-contained (very large) JAR file containing the application and
its dependencies in the <code>target/</code> directory. To run
the application:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
  java -jar target/quarkus-broker-rest-1.0.0-runner.jar
</pre>
<p>
By default, the application listens for HTTP clients on port
8080. It assumes that the message broker is accessible on
the local host, on port 61616, and is not authenticated. These settings
can be changed in <code>application.properties</code>. Assuming that the
broker is running, we can produce a message to the address <code>my_queue</code> by issuing this HTTP request:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
  curl -X POST --data-binary "This is a test" \
      localhost:8080/broker/produce/my_queue -H "content-type: text/plain"
</pre>
<p>
The <code>curl</code> command is a little fiddly, because <code>curl</code>
will by default send a request body as if it were an HTML form submission,
and that's not at all what is required here. 
<code>quarkus-broker-rest</code> could be adapted to handle this kind of
request if necessary, but it would require a bit more work. 
</p>
<p>
To consume the message from the same address:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
curl hostname:8080/broker/consume/my_queue
This is a test
</pre>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
It's quite easy to implement a REST interface to a message broker using
Camel and Quarkus. A real application will need encryption and
security, but these can be added to Quarkus without any 
code changes -- see my <a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/quarkus-suntimes-auth-trivial">trivial authentication</a> example to see how this might
be done, in a completely declarative (configuration-based) way.
</p>
<p>
What I haven't touched on here is any notion of tuning. The Camel
components used in this example are highly tunable. For example, you
can configure the pool of connections that is used for HTTP clients, and
separately the pool used for connections to the message broker.
You can also control more subtle aspects, such as the way that 
JMS sessions are cached between requests. All of this is reasonably
well documented for Quarkus.
