<h1 id="antix-vs.-mx-linux-on-old-ish-laptops">antiX vs. MX Linux on
old-ish laptops</h1>
<p><img src="img/tux.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>Now I’ve retired, I avoid unnecessary expenditure even more
dogmatically than I used to; and, frankly, I’ve always set that bar
pretty high. I loathe all forms of waste, but particularly tech-waste.
Dumping a working computer in favour of a newer, shinier one is not only
wasteful and destructive, but some old computers have features that few
modern ones can match. How many modern laptops offer tool-free swapping
of up to three hard drives, as my old Lenovo <a
href="w520.html">W520</a> does? How many can be powered indefinitely
from a phone charger, like my old Yoga 720? It isn’t only about saving
money – sometimes old equipment is actually better than new.</p>
<p>Of course, time moves on, and the computing industry has become
locked in an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_and_Bill%27s_law">Andy-and-Bill</a>
death-spiral, where software expands in scale and complexity to absorb
all available hardware resources. My Yoga 720’s 8Gb of non-upgradeable
RAM doesn’t look as generous as it did in 2013; nor does its rather puny
mobile-class CPU. Mainstream Linux distributions are now as complex and
resource-hungry as Windows although they don’t, thankfully, function as
advertising telemetry platforms. Still, a full installation of Fedora or
Ubuntu is impractical on most of my computers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong> I’m a long-term Linux enthusiast and, in a
small way, contributor. I don’t need desktop Linux to be pretty or easy
to install, as stock Fedora or Ubuntu are. I need Linux to be fast,
reliable, and configurable; if I have to set it up using command-line
tools, I’m OK with that. YMMV, of course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What frustrates me is that, ten years ago, my computers could do
everything I needed a computer to do. My needs haven’t changed; nor has
my hardware: software has changed, and not for the better.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, I’d create a highly-customized installation of <a
href="gentoo_winux.html">Gentoo Linux</a> for my old-ish computers –
Gentoo is good for squeezing the last drop of performance out of
hardware. Unfortunately, as I’ve <a href="gentoo_mx.html">written
elsewhere</a>, the compilation overheads of a custom installation of
Gentoo just demand too much of old hardware, particularly laptops.</p>
<p>For the last year or so, my go-to operating system has been <a
href="https://mxlinux.org">MX Linux</a>. On the whole, it works pretty
well, but not as well as the kind of Linux I ran in 2013, so I’ve been
looking for even more minimal alternatives. I have to admit, also, that
I’m not 100% in favour of some the design decisions that the MX Linux
maintainers have made, although I fully understand why they made
them.</p>
<p>MX Linux started life as a kind-of derivative of antiX, and there
continues to be some interaction between the two distributions. MX moved
in the direction of greater ease-of-use, while antiX retained more of
its focus on minimizing resource usage. So I thought it would be worth
considering antiX as a possible alternative to MX.</p>
<p>This article is about the similarities and differences between antiX
and MX; not just in how they appear to users, but in their technical
implementations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong> I tested the latest versions of antiX and MX
that were available in July 2025: MX 23.6 and antiX 23.2.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="first-impressions">First impressions</h2>
<p>Since MX began as an offshoot of antiX, it’s no surprise that the two
distributions have much in common. Both are based on the stable branch
of Debian, and users can (with caution) install software from the Debian
repositories. Neither distribution depends on systemd, but they differ
in how they handle the relentless encroachment of systemd into the Linux
world – more on this point later. Both favour lightweight graphical user
interfaces like Fluxbox, but MX is more willing than antiX to embrace
more substantial desktop environments. More on this, also, later.</p>
<p>Both MX and antiX will boot and run from a USB stick, and have rather
similar graphical installers. Both are much faster to boot, and use
fewer resources, than a typical installation of Ubuntu.</p>
<p>The maintainers of MX describe it as a ‘midweight, stable, simple’
desktop operating system. It isn’t positioned as a minimal platform, but
there is continued support for 32-bit CPUs.</p>
<p>The antiX maintainers describe their platform as “proudly
anti-fascist” and, while I don’t really approve of using the term
‘fascist’ this way, I understand the point they’re trying to make. Linux
has become dominated by corporate interests, which don’t have the
interests of enthusiasts at heart. All the major corporate players have
the same vision of how Linux should develop, and that vision doesn’t
include resource-efficiency, let alone freedom of choice for users. Far
more than MX, antiX shuns the modern trends in Linux, and it looks far
more like the Linux I used twenty years ago. And I mean that entirely as
a compliment.</p>
<p>antiX is much more a “minimal Linux” than MX is. A default
installation lacks even a system logger or a time synchronizer –
components that I consider essential. Oddly, though, the stock
installation includes the <code>sane</code> scanner daemon and the
<code>gpm</code> mouse manager. I can’t remember the last time I used
either of these, and I was surprised to find them included. Bothe antiX
and MX install the CUPS printer daemon, but only MX installs the
supporting software that many users will need, to make it useful.</p>
<p>Of course, Linux being what it is, we can always add and remove
software.</p>
<p>I have to admit, though, that I found antiX somewhat rough-edged in
places, compared with the overall slickness of MX. For example, antiX
uses the <code>roxterm</code> terminal emulator by default, but sets an
incompatible version of the <code>TERM</code> environment variable,
leading to odd characters being displayed. It wasn’t hard to fix these
problems, but I was a little surprised to see them at all, given how
long antiX has been around.</p>
<p>All in all, though, both antiX and MX were reasonably easy to install
and configure, and both do what I need an operating system to do.</p>
<h2 id="antix-mx-and-systemd">antiX, MX, and systemd</h2>
<p>Since its introduction, systemd has come to dominate all the
mainstream Linux distributions. It is so ubiquitous that the authors of
<em>application</em> software, as well as system software, tend to
assume that it will always be installed. I’ve written elsewhere why I
think <a href="systemd_embedded.html">the wholesale adoption of systemd
is a bad for embedded Linux</a>. The resource constraints of embedded
systems are similar to those of old computers, so I would expect systemd
to be problematic there as well. I also share the concerns of many, that
systemd is totally under the control of corporations who are acting in
their own interests, not ours. I’ve used systemd for years on modern,
highly-specified Linux workstations, and it works fine. This, of course,
is exactly the kind of environment that large corporations want to
support. Having Linux become impossible without systemd will do Linux
enthusiasts no favours in the long term, and that does seem to be where
we’re headed. It’s a trend I think we should resist, and both antiX and
MX resist it – but in different ways, to different extents.</p>
<p>Neither antiX not MX depend on systemd. However, they differ in how
they deal with the fact that so much other software depends on systemd.
MX uses a system of ‘shims’ for systemd, that is, it provides minimal
implementations of the systemd services that other software assumes will
be available. This shimming is fairly complicated, and relies on the
presence of software components whose functions are non-obvious. MX also
uses some components of systemd itself, like <code>systemd-udevd</code>
and <code>systemd-logind</code>. These are a device permission manager
and session permission manager respectively. The MX maintainers don’t
really claim that MX is ‘systemd-free’ and, indeed, it is not – it just
cuts down to a minimum the bits of systemd that it uses.</p>
<p>This means that MX is broadly systemd-friendly, and users
<em>can</em> run systemd if they want. There are some software
components, like Snap, that are almost impossible to run without
systemd. It’s feasible to run Snap on an MX installation with systemd
enabled.</p>
<p>The antiX maintainers took a different approach, one that I feel is
philosophically more palatable. Rather than shimming systemd, they’ve
sought – or implemented – software components that simply don’t need
it.</p>
<p>So, instead of <code>systemd-udevd</code>, antiX uses
<code>eudevd</code>, which is a fork of an early version of
<code>systemd-udevd</code>. It’s still derived from a systemd component,
but it is now a separate code-base, maintained independently.</p>
<p>Instead of <code>systemd-logind</code>, antiX uses
<code>seatd</code>. Some Linux distributions that try to be systemd-free
use <code>elogind</code> for session permission management. The problem
with <code>elogind</code> is that it is a rolling derivative of
<code>systemd-logind</code>, rather than being independently maintained.
<code>seatd</code> provides similar functionality to
<code>systemd-logind</code>, but has no code in common with systemd.</p>
<p>The problem with the antiX approach to avoiding systemd is that it’s
not a great fit with the Debian base. Like most major distributions,
Debian adopted systemd wholesale a while ago. There’s a <em>lot</em> of
software in the Debian repositories that won’t work on antiX, even if it
can be installed. That leaves the antiX maintainers with the unenviable
task of trying to provide alternatives for <em>everything</em> that
depends on systemd. So, for example, antiX provides a custom build of
the Xorg display server that has does not rely on systemd. systemd
dependencies are still a problem for MX, but its ‘shim’ approach makes
this situation a bit less of a bear.</p>
<p>There really is no solution now, to the problems that systemd has
created for Linux. Being unable to solve them, antiX and MX both work
around the problems in their own ways, with their own costs and
benefits. Both distributions are to be praised for doing their bit to
stem the rising tide of systemd, but the maintainers of antiX deserve
medals.</p>
<h2 id="guis-and-desktop-environments">GUIs and desktop
environments</h2>
<p>Both MX and antiX have first-class support for Fluxbox. This is
pretty much the only point where their provisions overlap. Fluxbox isn’t
a desktop environment (DE) – it’s a window manager that needs additional
components to be considered a full DE. antiX tends to favour DE
implementations that are at least as simple as Fluxbox, while MX favours
those that are at least as complicated. However, MX’s generosity in this
area doesn’t really extend to GNOME, because it’s hard to make GNOME
work without systemd. I’ve seen reports of people running GNOME on MX,
but I can’t help thinking that, if you have the resources to run GNOME,
there are better ways to do it.</p>
<p>MX favours the Xfce4 DE. This is a true DE, with a full set of
integrated tools – window manager, file manager, screen-saver, terminal
emulator, and many others. Xfce4 has been my preferred DE for as long as
I can remember, and I’ve never really seen a need to change. Xfce4 is a
modern, well-maintained DE – while it doesn’t have the eye-candy of
GNOME and KDE, it’s entirely useable, and isn’t painful to look at.</p>
<p>Fluxbox, <code>jwm</code>, and IceWM – favoured by antiX – all look
like something from the nineties. They work fine, but they’re
astonishingly ugly. To be fair, the appearance can be tweaked a bit and,
if speed and minimal resource usage have ugliness as their price, I
consider it one worth paying. IceWM makes even Xfce4 look bloated and
sluggish.</p>
<p>The problem, though, is that Fluxbox, et al., are not really DEs.
antiX builds a full DE around these components, but the parts are not
always terribly well integrated. As all are included in the default
install, the software menu has hundreds of entries, for tools that
support all the different window managers. It’s not obvious (to me) how
to configure any of them, and I had to use a lot of trial-and-error to
get things set up as I wanted.</p>
<p>I have to say, also, that some of the supporting components don’t
work that well, or that reliably. I suspect this is because the
maintainers have had to choose older, less well-maintained components,
to avoid the systemd dependencies of newer software. Wifi network
management is a case in point. MX provides NetworkManager (NM) by
default. NM is a splendid piece of software, but it has many
dependencies, and (sigh) tends to favour systemd-friendly installations.
antiX provides a number of alternative network managers that work fine,
but none is as robust, or as easy to use as NM.</p>
<p>Similarly, the various file managers provided by antix
(<code>rox</code> and <code>zzzfm</code>) are idiosyncratic, to put it
mildly. The <code>rox</code> window resizes itself continuously, to fit
the number of items in a directory. <code>zzzfm</code> doesn’t respond
to double-clicks in the same was as any similar software I’ve used. None
of these problems is insurmountable, but all are slightly
irritating.</p>
<p>MX has first-class support for KDE, but I think this is a new-ish
development, and I’m not sure how well it works. I’m unlikely to find
out, because I don’t have the kind of hardware that will run KDE
effectively.</p>
<h2 id="video">Video</h2>
<p>Neither MX nor antiX have much time for Wayland, the display
architecture that almost all other Linux distributions have fallen over
themselves to adopt. I don’t much care for Wayland, both for
philosophical reasons, and because it still doesn’t work well with the
NVidia display hardware I have. In due course, the latter problem might
be solved, but the philosophical objections will remain.</p>
<p>Whatever my views, Xfce4 has limited support for Wayland at present,
and the window managers favoured by antiX have none. It’s important to
understand that supporting Wayland isn’t just a matter of adding support
for a different display server – you have to implement the Wayland
protocols <em>in</em> your DE. Supporting Wayland amounts to munging a
display server into your window manager, which is why many people find
Wayland philosophically troublesome. Xfce4 is sufficiently popular that
there is some interest in adapting it for Wayland; that’s unlikely ever
to happen with IceWM or Fluxbox.</p>
<p>As a result, both MX and antiX provide good ol’ Xorg, at the same
revision.</p>
<h2 id="audio">Audio</h2>
<p>MX and antiX both install and configure Pipewire by default. I <a
href="back_to_alsa.html">prefer to use plain ALSA</a> for audio, but I
do understand why many people like the convenience of Pipewire, Pulse,
and the like. My main complaint with all of these systems is that it’s
fiddly to have an audio application write digital data directly to an
external DAC. I’m very fussy about audio quality, so it’s important to
me that my operating system not fiddle about with audio data. For many
people – perhaps most people – the ability to switch between speakers
and Bluetooth headphones without running a bunch of obscure commands is
probably more important.</p>
<p>Happily, Pipewire does not prevent my audio applications writing
directly to hardware using ALSA when I need that. My real objection to
it – and this isn’t the fault of Pipewire itself – is that it’s
accompanied by a Pulse compatibility server. This is to accommodate the
short-sighted decisions of certain application maintainers to support
only Pulse for audio. So far as I know, Ubuntu is the only major Linux
distribution that still uses Pulse by default, but we are all now locked
into supporting its API so heavy-hitters like Firefox will work. Nice
one, guys.</p>
<p>Since antiX and MX both use the same audio infrastructure by default,
there’s nothing to compare in this respect.</p>
<h2 id="distribution-specific-utilities">Distribution-specific
utilities</h2>
<p>One of the impressive things about MX Linux is the set of MX-specific
utilities it provides. These are mostly for system administration and
configuration – things that I would ordinarily do by hacking on
configuration files. These tools are easy to use, well documented, and
look nice.</p>
<p>antiX has more modest aspirations in this area. It offers only a few
distribution-specific utilities, and they don’t always work all that
well. To be fair, I don’t believe antiX has enough developers to
undertake major work in this area. Moreover, it ought not really to be
necessary – in an ideal world, general-purpose administration utilities
should work on any Linux platform.</p>
<h2 id="comprehensibility">Comprehensibility</h2>
<p>One of the ways I judge a Linux installation is by the number of
processes that are running at idle. Fedora, running GNOME, has hundreds
of processes, many having functions I can’t even guess at. Running
<code>ps -ef</code> on antiX, on the other hand, reveals the same
process list I saw on a Linux system twenty years ago.</p>
<p>MX falls somewhere between these extremes – its idle process set is
much larger than that of antiX, but most of these processes are
associated with the Xfce4 DE, while antiX is only running a traditional
window manager.</p>
<p>Still, MX does run some processes whose functions I don’t understand,
and I generally take that to be a bad sign. I don’t understand why MX
needs <code>cgmanager</code>, for example. This is a process that
listens for DBus messages and carries out operations on Control Groups
(CGs). CGs are a feature of container operation, and I have no clue why
<code>cgmanager</code> is needed if you’re not running containers.
However, MX doesn’t work properly if I disable <code>cgmanager</code>,
so clearly it’s being used somewhere. There was a discussion of this
point on the MX forum, and nobody there seemed to know, either. systemd
(of course) interacts with CGs, so I presume that <code>cgmanager</code>
is part of the systemd shim mechanism that MX employs.</p>
<p>MX also commits what I consider to be a cardinal sin: it has
background processes written in scripting languages. The Xfce4 Bluetooth
applet, for example, is written in Python, and uses 50Mb of RAM. To be
fair to MX, it’s not advertised as a minimal Linux, and this particular
problem is in Xfce4 rather than MX itself. Still, I find it a little
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>On the whole, both MX and antiX are, I believe, mostly comprehensible
to a Linux enthusiast, but antiX has the edge.</p>
<h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h2>
<p>Both antiX and MX are suitable for my modest needs, and both work
well on my computers, which are all at least ten years old.</p>
<p>MX could plausibly be used by somebody new to Linux. It provides set
of curated tools that are well integrated, and have a reasonably
consistent look-and-feel. You wouldn’t have to do much post-install
tweaking, if all you wanted was something that worked.</p>
<p>antiX, on the other hand, is for enthusiasts. You can get strong
performance with limited resources – but it takes a lot of tweaking to
get there. antiX looks and behaves in a rather old-fashioned way; that
doesn’t bother me, but it will be off-putting for some.</p>
<p>But antiX is doing things <em>properly</em>, from the perspective of
a long-term Linux enthusiast. It’s not making accommodations with
systemd and other contemporary, counter-productive trends. Rather, it’s
avoiding them completely. The antiX maintainers have chosen the Hard
Path, for sure. MX steers a middle course between dying on the
anti-systemd hill like antiX and Devuan, and complete surrender like,
well, like just about everybody else.</p>
<p>Much as I have grown to like MX Linux, there will be more antiX in my
future. Those of us who care about the future of Linux as an
enthusiast’s platform should be supporting antiX, and things like
it.</p>
