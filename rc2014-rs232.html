<h1>Designing a dual 5V-to-RS232 serial level converter for the RC2014</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/chip.png" 
  alt="Chip logo"/>
This article in one of my series 
<a href="rc2014.html">Adventures with RC2014, Z80, and CP/M</a>.
In it, I describe how I designed a dual 5V-to-RS232 level converter
board for the RC2014 bus. Such a board -- or something equivalent -- is
necessary if you want to connect real RS232 peripherals (printers, modems,
terminals), rather than using PC-based simulations of peripherals.
The RS232 standard is not based on 5V logic levels, but on +/- 12V. 
</p>
<p>
It's possible to by 5V-to-RS232 converters from a number of sources, including
online auction sites. These modules have several problems, for this application. 
</p>
<p>
First, they tend to be single-channel. If you need two serial ports -- as I do -- 
then wiring and mounting the modules can get untidy.
</p>
<p>
Second, and more significantly, cheap RS232 converter modules usually 
don't support hardware handshaking (flow control).
That's a big deal, when connecting devices of different speed. A Z80 CPU is
not particular fast, by modern standards, but it's a heck of a lot faster than
a 1980s serial printer. Hardware flow control is essential for some applications.
</p>
<p>
A more subtle problem is that there are various ways that an RS232 port can be
wired. While these wiring schemes might all be legitimate, interfacing is 
difficult if you don't know exactly what wiring is in use. Very few of these
inexpensive RS232 converter modules come with a circuit diagram. 
</p>
<p>
My plan was eventually to design a PCB that would plug into the RC2014 backplane,
next to the serial module or motherboard, and be connected to it by
short cables. Then longer cables would connect the voltage converter PCB
to proper RS232 sockets on the back panel of the enclosure. 
There's no compelling, functional need to plug the RS232 level converter
into the backplane -- it doesn't use any of the backplane signals,
and even the power supply comes from the connection to the serial hardware.
But making it backplane-compatible provides for a neat construction, as there's
no need to find a place to mount another board in the enclosure.
</p>
<p>
Complete design details, including Gerber files for PCB fabrication, are
available
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/max232_conv">in my GitHub repository</a>.
</p>

<h2>RS232 refresher</h2>
<p>
If you're even reading this, you probably have some understanding of how 
RS232 works. However, there are some subtleties that aren't obvious.
</p>
<p>
RS232 defines a signalling protocol and a wiring scheme for connectors.
There are two common connectors: the 9-pin DB9, and the 25-pin DB25. 
For reasons that must have made sense to somebody at some point, the 
wiring of the DB9 is <i>not</i> a strict subset of the wiring of the
DB25. By that I mean that the functions of pins 1-9 in the DB25 are not
the same as pins 1-9 in the DB9. In particular, the TX and RX pins
are reversed. 
</p>
<p>
What this means is that you need to be careful about interpreting 
published circuit designs for RS232 peripherals -- the wiring of the actual sockets
might not be correct for your application. In addition, RS232 defines
'DTE wiring' and 'DCE wiring', for both the DB9 and the DB25 (and, sigh, they
are different). Originally,
the 'DTE' wiring scheme was used for computers and terminals, while the 
'DCE' scheme was used for modems. The idea here was that the wiring
between a computer or terminal and a modem would be 'straight'. That is,
pin 1 to pin 1, pin 2 to pin 2, and so on. Of course, the 'transmit'
connection of one end of the link must go to the 'receive' connection at the
other and <i>vice versa</i>; but originally this signal handling was 
the job of the modem.
To connect two DTE components, you'll need a 'null modem' cable,
that swaps the RX/TX and corresponding handshaking connections. 
</p>
<p>
RS232 defines a variety of hardware handshaking schemes, but the one that
is (probably) most widely used is RTS/CTS. A component that wants to
transmit asserts RTS ('request to send'). A component that has capacity
to receive asserts CTS ('clear to send'). Conventionally, the modem
(or the null modem cable) would swap RTS and CTS, to make a 
functional handshaking system with just these two signals.
</p>
<p>
The conventional wiring for a panel-mount DB9 DTE, which I
have adopted in my construction, is as follows:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
DB9 Pin  Function
2        RX
3        TX
5        GND
7        RTS
8        CTS
</pre>

<p>
A null modem cable, for connecting the RC2014 system to a terminal or printer, 
must swap pins 2/3, and pins 7/8. That's assuming the terminal has a DB9 connector, 
not a DB25. Sigh.
</p>
<p>
Serial interface chips designed for 8-bit computers, like the 8250, are
already RS232-compatible in terms of the communication protocol. What's
not compatible is the voltage level. RS232 requires -12V for a logic
1 and +12V for a logic 0.  
</p>

<h2>Introducing the MAX232</h2>
<p>
The MAXIM MAX232 chip has been the staple of RS232 interfacing for nearly 
30 years. It uses a 'charge pump' design to generate the +/- 12V 
levels for signalling.
A complete design requires only five capacitors in addition to the IC.
These capacitors are 'pumped' by an oscillator to generate voltages
above or below the supply.
</p>
<p>
My first attempt at a voltage level converter was to use pre-fabricated
MAX232 modules, which cost next to nothing and are widely available on
eBay. These are so plentiful that they come on rolls.
Each module is a single transceiver, that is, it handles a 
single receive/transmit conversation. So to use RTS/CTS handshaking, you'll
need two modules -- one for RX/TX and one for RTS/CTS. 
</p>
<p>
These modules are horrible to solder, and my first prototype looked
like this:
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/max232_conv_1.jpg" alt="Photo of board" width="650px"/>
</p>

<p>
Note that there are three modules, not four, because the SC130 board I'm
using in my RC2014 design has no hardware handshaking on its second
serial port (that's a limitation of the Z180 CPU). So there was no point
wiring up a handshaking interface for both serial ports in the prototype.
</p>
<p>
Aside from the ugliness, this design did not work. Every so often, one of
the MAX232 modules would suddenly overheat -- hot enough to melt solder.
I traced these events down to unplugging the RS232 connection while the system
is powered. That's something I can reasonably expect to happen, and fairly
frequently, so the design has to be able to tolerate it.
</p>
<p>
I've since discovered that this overheating problem is common in these cheap
modules. A common 'solution' is to put a small resistor in series with the
power supply to the module, but this didn't work for me. Nor did pulling up
or pulling down the various signal lines. 
These modules have the advantage of being very compact, because all the
capacitors are surface-mounted onto the back of the module. However, 
space is not at a premium in my design, and this didn't really look like
an avenue worth exploring further, given how flakey these cheap modules are.
</p>

<h2>Second prototype</h2>
<p>
My second prototype used discrete electrolytic capacitors on stripboard. The
16-pin DIP variant of the MAX232 is a dual transceiver, meaning that
it can handle both RX/TX and CTS/RTS in one chip. Even with 
electrolytic capacitors, the design is compact enough that I see how 
I could get two instances of the circuit onto a PCB that would fit
in a RC2014 backplane. 
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="img/max232_conv_2.jpg" alt="Photo of board" width="650px"/>
</p>
<p>
This prototype did not suffer any of the overheating of the first one, 
although I think it's advsiable to be careful where you get your MAX232
chips from. It's a popular device, and there are fakes on the market.  
</p>
<p>
Something that caught me out -- both in the stripboard prototype and when
designing the PCB -- is the polarity of the electrolytic capacitors. 
Because the charge pump generates voltages more negative than the supply
voltage, some of the capacitors have their anodes (positive terminals)
at 0V. This makes sense in this application, but isn't something seen
very often.
</p>

<h2>Designing the PCB</h2>
<p>
I used Kicad 6 for drawing the schematic and laying out the PCB. For a design
like this, there's no need to use anything more complex than a two-layer 
(front and back) PCB, and I have no idea how well Kicad handles more complex
situations. 
The circuit schematic and PCB design are available
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/max232_conv">in my GitHub repository</a>,
in Kicad format and PNG.
</p>
<p>
I confess that I haven't designed a PCB since the mid-80s, so getting to grips
with Kicad was a bit of a struggle. What made this particular design
tractable, even for a noob like me, is that all the components I needed to use
had PCB footprints in the Kicad libraries. It's possible to create custom
footprints, but it's a pain.  
</p>
<p>
There are places where routing the PCB tracks on two layers was a little
fiddly but, since I had already built a design on stripboard, I knew it
was possible. With hinsight, I can see that there's enough room on the board
to make the PCB tracks thicker, but so far this doesn't seem to be a
problem. 
</p>
<p>
Most PCB manufacturers accept PCB design files in Gerber format, which is
something that Kicad can produce. However, the fabricator will usually
have limits on things like track width, via hole size, pad separation, and
so on. So it's worth deciding on a fabricator in advance, because these things
are awkward to change when the layout has been done.
</p>
<p>
The conventional RC2014 module size -- about 50mm x 100mm -- was chosen by
its original proponents in
part because it would be cheap to fabricate PCBs that size. Right now, 
I'm sending my PCBs to
JLCPCB for fabrication, because this company will make small production runs for 
reasonable cost. At the time of writing, it costs $5 including shipping to 
make five copies 
of the same board. This is amazing value for money -- it's is so cheap 
that it's almost worth skipping the 
stripboard prototyping stage completely, and going direct to PCB. However, the
turn-around time at this price point is about six weeks (including shipping), so
using PCBs for prototyping is only practicable if you're in no hurry. 
</p>
<p>
This is what the finished board looks like. 
</p>

</p>

<p>
The board fits neatly into the backplace of my RC2014 system although, of course,
it does occupy one backplane slot, that can't be used for something more
interesting. In the photo below, the connections on the top of the board
go to RS232 sockets on the rear panel, while the side connections
(on the right) are to the RC130 montherboard in the adjacent slot.
