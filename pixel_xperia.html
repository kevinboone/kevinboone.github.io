Pixel and Sony Xperia handsets for budget de-Googling</h1>
<p><img src="img/degoogle.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>This article is about choosing between a refurbished Google Pixel and
a refurbished Sony Xperia, for people who want a low-cost, Google-free
smartphone. In order to make the comparison as fair as possible, I’ve
chosen two handsets that were released within days of one another, which
have similar screens and capabilities, and are available now at similar
prices. Specifically, I’m comparing the Google Pixel 7a, and the Sony
Xperia 10 V. These were ‘budget’ handsets when they were released, and
you can now get a refurbished model of either, in good condition, for
UK£100-150.</p>
<p>Of course, you can pay a lot more for a Sony or Google handset, even
a refurbished one. At the time of writing, you might pay £450 for either
a Pixel 9 or an Xperia 1 V and, again, they will have broadly similar
specifications. I will comment briefly on the more expensive handsets in
each range, where I think I have enough information to do so. Because
I’m stingy, and retired, I have more experience of the cheaper
models.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
I’m assuming the reader knows at least a little about installing
alternative firmware on an Android handset. I won’t be explaining any of
the installation procedures, or describing how to use tools like
<code>adb</code>. All the handsets I describe have well-documented
installation procedures for all the alternative firmwares they support,
and can be purchased de-Googled from specialist suppliers if you prefer
to avoid the installation altogether.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="first-impressions">First impressions</h2>
<p>The Pixel 7a and Xperia 10 V are similar in size, and have similar,
flat OLED HDR screens with Gorilla Glass externals. Both have plastic
frames with rounded corners, although the Pixel is about 50g heavier.
They feel similar in the hand.</p>
<p>Their stock firmwares have similar user interfaces and, so long as
you don’t get a carrier-locked model, there’s relatively little vendor
bloatware on either (at least as compared to Samsung’s horrific stock
firmware).</p>
<h2 id="choice-of-de-googled-firmware">Choice of de-Googled
firmware</h2>
<p>Google’s Pixel range is, ironically, favoured by de-Googlers, and
with good reason: it’s easy to install alternative firmware, and there’s
quite a range available. Of the mainstream possibilities (not that
anything is ‘mainstream’ in this field), recent Pixels support
LineageOS, /e/OS, GrapheneOS, and CalyxOS, and probably others. If you
go for the Xperia, you’ll be limited to /e/OS or LineageOS – and you
probably won’t be able to re-lock the bootloader after installation, if
that’s a concern. I’m a long-standing Lineage user, but these days I’d
probably install Graphene if I could, and if it worked perfectly. I had
a few minor problems with Graphene on the Pixel 7a, but none with
Lineage or /e/OS. Of course, I can’t compare Lineage and Graphene on the
Xperia, because it won’t run Graphene.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>A prerequisite to installing new firmware is the ability to unlock
the bootloader, and it’s difficult to predict in advance whether this
will be possible. Handsets provided by cellular carriers are notorious
for having their firmwares locked down, presumably to make it difficult
to transfer them to other networks.</p>
<p>I’ve not so far heard of a recent Pixel which doesn’t allow the
bootloader to be unlocked, but Sony is the only manufacturer I know of
that actually <a
href="https://developer.sony.com/open-source/aosp-on-xperia-open-devices/get-started/unlock-bootloader">documents
how to unlock their bootloaders</a>. Unlocking the bootloader on the
Xperia does require a secret code which you can get from Sony’s website.
If Sony changed its policy in this regard, you’d be stuck, because
there’s no way to proceed without this code (and it’s specific to the
handset).</p>
<p>Right now, though, it’s unlikely you’ll come across a Pixel or Xperia
handset that can’t have its bootloader unlocked, so long as you avoid
carrier-locked models.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
Since de-Googlers are likely to be privacy-conscious I’ll point out
that, although, unlocking an Xperia’s bootloader does require input from
Sony, Sony doesn’t ask for any personal information.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
Sony deserves credit for actively supporting open-source development. At
a time when many smartphone vendors need the threat of legal action even
to comply with the minimal obligations that arise from their use of
open-source components, Sony actively distributes both source code and
binary blobs for their Android. Google did the same until recently, but
there’s some question about their ongoing commitment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both the Xperia and Pixel handsets support the ‘fastboot’ protocol in
their bootloaders, and installation of new firmware is comparatively
easy – at least compared to Samsung’s handsets, and the finger-breaking
button combinations they require to enter the appropriate installation
modes. If you have a Pixel, and you’re installing Graphene, you could
use the web-based installer (which works with Chromium-based browsers).
Otherwise, you’ll need the <code>adb</code> and <code>fastboot</code>
tools, which are widely available for most computers.</p>
<p>When I installed Lineage on my Xperia 10 V, I encountered the problem
that installation appeared to get stuck at 47%. This is a documented
oddity and, in fact, the installation appears to be have been
successful, despite this. On the Pixel 7a, installation of Graphene,
/e/OS, and Lineage went entirely smoothly, with the whole process taking
less than 15 minutes for each (once I’d assembled the tools and firmware
files). Post-installation set-up will likely take longer, because you
probably won’t be drawing all your configuration from Google’s
servers.</p>
<p>Both /e/OS and LineageOS are easy to root, if you need that
capability. If you need to root your Pixel, it will be easier to install
one of these firmwares than Graphene, which discourages rooting.</p>
<p>One peculiarity I noted with the Xperia was that in ‘fastboot’ mode
(where you’d do most of the installation), you see a blank screen. The
only way to tell it’s successfully entered fastboot mode is that the
notification LED turned blue. The Pixel handsets display a specific
information screen in fastboot mode. Despite this oddity, all the usual
fastboot commands worked fine on the Xperia.</p>
<p>Both the Xperia and the Pixel show warning messages at boot time
after installing custom firmware. Even with GrapheneOS, which allows the
bootloader to be relocked, I still see a warning. On neither handset
does the warning block the boot process, but I would prefer to be able
to remove it.</p>
<h2 id="speed-and-responsiveness">Speed and responsiveness</h2>
<p>The Pixel 7A has a faster CPU and GPU than the Xperia, and is
<em>twice</em> as fast in some benchmarks. Moreover, it has 25% more
RAM. For the same price, you get better computing resources from the
Pixels than from the Xperias.</p>
<p>These aren’t just notional differences: the Pixel is noticeably
snappier in operation, in a side-by-side comparison. Rendering
complicated web pages, for example, is manifestly faster. The Pixel 7a
starts from power-off in about 20 seconds, while the Xperia takes nearly
a minute. Because recent Android versions do such a lot of
initialization on power-on, routine operations like launching apps
aren’t noticeably faster on one handset than the other.</p>
<p>In fact, while the Xperia 10 range is often described by reviewers as
‘underpowered’, I’m not sure I’d notice the deficiency except when I
have a faster handset in my other hand. Perhaps I would – I do a lot of
this kind of testing. Whatever: both the Xperia 10 V and the Pixel 7a
are fast enough for day-to-day operation, and neither would be fast
enough for video gaming, I suspect.</p>
<h2 id="screens">Screens</h2>
<p>Both the Xperia 10 V and the Pixel 7a have OLED screens of
approximately six inches diagonal, with about 450 pixels-per-inch
density. Side-by-side they look the same to me. The difference is in the
aspect ratio: all models in the Xperia range have a 21:9 shape, which is
widely used in movies, and nowhere else.</p>
<p>I scarcely notice the difference in aspect ratio in day-to-day use
although, of course, it’s easy to see when then handsets are
side-by-side. The more expensive Xperia models have larger screens (with
the same shape), and some users have complained that they’re awkward to
operate one-handed. I can’t imagine that being a problem with the Xperia
10 range, and I don’t have a problem with the larger models (but I have
hands like dinner plates).</p>
<p>The Pixel 7a display has a 90Hz refresh rate, rather than the Xperia
10’s 60Hz. Frankly, I think these fast refresh rates are a marketing
gimmick, and I can’t see the difference even under hard use.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Xperias avoid the modern trend of putting the
front-facing camera in an irritating notch or cut-out in the display:
it’s in a separate part of the casing above the screen. A small point,
but significant if you find screen cut-outs irritating.</p>
<p>Another small instance of reduced irritation: the Xperias have
SIM-card slots that can be opened without a tool.</p>
<h2 id="fingerprint-sensor">Fingerprint sensor</h2>
<p>The Xperia 10 V has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor in the power
button. The Pixel has an in-screen sensor. Both worked fine, with all
the firmwares I tried, although the Xperia’s was rather fussy to set
up.</p>
<p>I prefer the side-mounted fingerprint sensor, because it’s easier to
find in the dark, but I appreciate that this is a matter of taste.</p>
<h2 id="fm-radio">FM radio</h2>
<p>The Xperia 10 V has a built-in FM radio although it is, sadly, the
last Sony handset to have one. So far as I know, none of the Pixel range
has an FM radio.</p>
<p>I guess this isn’t a big deal for most people: you can get the same
content using Internet broadcasting, which most radio stations now
support.</p>
<p>I like FM radio because it works in off-grid situations where there’s
no Internet access. However, I don’t regard its lack as a show-stopper,
and I suspect it wasn’t a widely-used feature in the Xperia devices.</p>
<h2 id="cameras">Cameras</h2>
<p>The Pixel 7a has notionally superior sensor resolution to the Xperia
10 V in all its cameras, front and rear. However, I suspect the sensor
out-performs the lens in all modern smartphones, and I don’t see any
difference between the Xperia and Pixel handsets with everyday
snapshots. Both benefit from a bit of post-processing. If you use a
smartphone for serious photography, you’d probably do better to read
reviews that focus on this sort of thing, because I don’t exercise the
cameras much.</p>
<h2 id="audio">Audio</h2>
<p>The huge, overpowering difference between all the Xperia models, and
all the Pixel models, is that the Xperias have a headphone jack attached
to a hi-fi quality DAC. If you’re a hi-fi enthusiast and like to use
top-quality, wired headphones, you’ll need an external DAC for your
Pixel – and not one of those cheap dongles.</p>
<p>I used a Moondrop Dawn Pro with the Pixel, with Sennheiser 800s
headphones, and it sounded marvellous. But the Xperia sounded marvellous
without the hassle of the extra DAC. And, of course, the DAC adds to the
cost, if you don’t already have one. And you won’t be able to charge the
handset with the DAC plugged in unless you also (sigh) buy a USB-C
hub.</p>
<p>The reality is that if you care about getting top-quality audio from
your smartphone, the Xperia range is currently the only game in town.
But you can get excellent audio – albeit not the very best – from
wireless headphones these days. Both the handsets I tested, with all the
firmwares I tested, supported the LDAC Bluetooth codec, and were stable
at the highest bitrate. So, with decent Bluetooth headphones, you should
still get close to CD-quality audio.</p>
<p>In short, while the Xperias offer real hi-fi credentials, that
probably won’t be a make-or-break matter for most purchasers (although
it kind-of is for me).</p>
<h2 id="storage">Storage</h2>
<p>Modern Xperias all support SD storage expansion up to 1Tb. The Pixels
have no SD slot, but they do support USB-C memory sticks. Like the use
of USB headphones and dongles, attaching a USB-C memory stick prevents
charging and, while these devices did work in my tests, for all
firmwares, I don’t regard this as a practical means of storage
expansion.</p>
<p>It’s not surprising that the Pixels don’t support storage expansion:
Google wants you to store all your stuff in their cloud. My feeling is
that anybody who wants a Google-free handset will probably also want
plentiful on-device storage, so the Xperias win hands-down in this
area.</p>
<h2 id="charging">Charging</h2>
<p>When I installed Lineage on the Xperia 10V, I was concerned to see
that it wouldn’t charge wirelessly. After several hours of fruitless
fiddling, I reinstalled the stock firmware, only to find that didn’t
work, either.</p>
<p>I thought at first that my handset had a hardware fault but, no:
amazingly, there are handsets made in 2023 that don’t support wireless
charging at all. Who’d have thought it?</p>
<p>The Pixel 7a supported wireless charging, with stock and alternative
firmware.</p>
<p>Some reviewers have complained that the Xperias are slow to charge
over USB-C, but this isn’t something I noticed.</p>
<h2 id="battery-life">Battery life</h2>
<p>The Xperia 10 V has a battery whose capacity is about 25% greater
than the Pixel’s – at least on paper. In practice, I found the Xperia’s
batter life to be hugely superior to the Pixels: far in excess of 25%
longer.</p>
<p>I don’t know why this should be, when I’m running the same apps in
broadly the same way on the same firmware (tested using Lineage).
Perhaps the Pixel’s faster screen refresh is the culprit, or perhaps it
just uses a more watt-hungry CPU. Or perhaps the Xperia throttles the
CPU more, for temperature regulation?</p>
<p>I don’t know the explanation, and I think it would be inadvisable to
read too much into my observations. I’m testing refurbished units, and
neither has a new battery. The battery life will undoubtedly be affected
by the way the previous owners used the handset. All the same, my
observations do back up what other reviewers found.</p>
<h2 id="volte-support">VoLTE support</h2>
<p>This is becoming a Big Deal, as network carriers switch off their
2G/3G infrastructure. In my region, and in many others, VoLTE is the
only way to carry a voice call and, if your handset doesn’t support it,
you won’t be able to make calls. At the time of writing, no Samsung
handset supports VoLTE with any non-vendor firmware, and some don’t
support it even with Samsung firmware.</p>
<p>I’m pleased to report, though, that VoLTE calling has been flawless
with both the Xperia and Pixel handsets, with all the alternative
firmwares I tested.</p>
<h2 id="ok-google-oddity-on-lineage">“OK Google” oddity on Lineage</h2>
<p>I mention this in passing, although I can’t assess its
significance.</p>
<p>When I installed LineageOS on the Pixel 7a, I noticed that two
Google-related processes were running:
<code>com.android.hotwordenrollment.xgoogle</code> and
<code>com.android.hotwordenrollment.okgoogle</code>. I believe these are
concerned with detection of the “OK Google” voice prompt. Since I
specifically didn’t install any Google applications or services, I don’t
understand why these processes were there.</p>
<p>I contacted the LineageOS maintainers about this and I was told that
inclusion of these services was intentional, they couldn’t remember why,
and that they “couldn’t be bothered to find out” (their exact
words).</p>
<p>Whatever the explanation, I uninstalled the packages that provided
these processes, and everything still works. Of course, if you actually
use the “OK Google” functionality, you might need to leave these things
alone.</p>
<p>I didn’t see these suspicious processes with Graphene on the Pixel,
nor with Lineage on the Xperia. Whether they represent a privacy
problem, I’m not sure.</p>
<h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h2>
<p>Google Pixel and Sony Xperia handsets are all good targets for
de-Googling: installation of alternative firmware is comparatively
straightforward, and nearly all features work fine.</p>
<p>But in most relevant particulars, at a comparable price point, the
Pixel handsets outperform the Xperias. They’re certainly better
computing platforms, with stronger CPUs and GPUs, and more RAM. They
have superior camera sensors, and support more up-to-date standards for
USB, Bluetooth, and wi-fi. Of course, the top-of-the-range Xperia will
out-perform a budget Pixel – but here I’m comparing models with similar
prices from a refurbisher.</p>
<p>In fact, the differences are even more stark when you compare the
<em>new</em> prices. The Xperia 10 V was nearly <em>twice</em> the price
of the Pixel 7a when both were released.</p>
<p>If you’re concerned about the physical security of the handset – and
you probably should be, to some extent – buying a Pixel allows you to
run Graphene, which has unmatched protection against tampering and ‘evil
maid’ attacks. That’s not to say that Lineage and /e/OS are weak in
security – far from it – but Graphene has the edge when it comes to
device protection.</p>
<p>So it isn’t hard to see why the Pixel handsets are so popular. For
most people, the only reason to choose the Xperia 10 V over the Pixel 7a
is the improved battery life of the Xperia.</p>
<p>There is, however, one group of de-Googlers who will likely favour
the Xperia: hi-fi enthusiasts. Or, I suppose, anybody for whom
top-quality audio is a priority. Not only do the Xperias have hi-fi
quality DACs and proper headphone jacks, they have the expandable
storage that you’ll need if you’re sitting on a stack of hi-res FLAC
audio files. There are other reasons to favour wired audio over
wireless, including better A/V synchronization in video content, and a
reduced number of devices that have to be kept charged.</p>
<p>Actually, I suppose there’s another kind of person who will favour
the Sony handset: someone who doesn’t want to support Google in any way.
Given that this article is about de-Googling, I imagine that there are a
few readers in this group, including myself to some extent. I have to
bite my lip and force myself to buy anything with Google branding.</p>
<p>I’ve been using a Pixel 7 for the last month and, while it’s been
fine in most ways, the constant copying of media onto its meagre
built-in storage has been a real drag. With an Xperia and a terrabyte SD
card, media provision is essentially a fill-and-forget proposition.
Using an external DAC has also been a nuisance: a small DAC like the
Moondrop is too easy to lose, and a full-sized one is, well, full-sized.
But ready support for wired headphones is likely only an advantage if
you happen to own top-of-the-range wired headphones, or you have some
other compelling reason to prefer wired audio.</p>
<p>The other stand-out feature of the Xperias is their screen aspect
ratio. If you’re an avid movie-watcher, you might like the 21:9 shape.
I’m sure that’s going to be a clincher for some people, even if it isn’t
for me.</p>
<p>In summary: you’ll probably favour the Pixel handsets if…</p>
<ul>
<li>You expect substantial computing power for your money</li>
<li>You want to run GrapheneOS because, for example, you fear the Evil
Maid, or there are other compelling reasons to use GrapheneOS</li>
<li>You don’t need much local media storage, because you stream
everything</li>
<li>You want wireless charging, even in budget handsets</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll probably favour the Xperias if…</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re a hi-fi enthusiast, or you just prefer wired audio for other
reasons (nothing extra to charge, for example)</li>
<li>You need plenty of local storage because, for example, you’re often
off-grid or you just don’t want the hassle of managing limited
storage</li>
<li>You like the 21:9 screen shape</li>
<li>You need multi-day battery life</li>
</ul>
