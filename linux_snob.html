<h1 id="ten-steps-to-becoming-a-linux-snob">Ten steps to becoming a
Linux snob</h1>
<p><img src="img/tux.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>There was a time when merely being a Linux user set you apart from
the common herd. Linux was hard to install, and took years to learn to
use effectively. You could feel superior just by being able to get Linux
to boot at all.</p>
<p>These days, Linux is as easy to install and use as anything else.
Easier, perhaps. Anybody can do it. So using Linux is no longer a sign
of our geek status – we need to go further.</p>
<p>Here are a few suggestions.</p>
<p><em>1. Cultivate a neck-beard or some other grooming
catastrophe</em></p>
<p>Unappealing facial hair is a sign of a committed Linux user. If
you’re unable, for biological reasons, to grow a neck-beard, knee-length
socks with sandals is a reasonable alternative badge of status. I once
shaved my beard, and forgot how to use <code>grep</code>. True story.
And as for personal hygeine – who wants to waste time showering or
cleaning their teeth? A Linux snob is too busy hacking for that kind of
thing.</p>
<p><em>2. Never refer to ‘Linux’ – it’s ‘GNU/Linux’ or
some-such</em></p>
<p>It’s best to correct anybody who makes this mistake, ideally with a
sneering half-chuckle. <em>Linux</em> is for the masses,
<em>GNU/Linux</em> is for the illuminati.</p>
<p><em>3. Hate on Linux dstributions that are intended to be
user-friendly with as much vigour as you hate on Windows</em></p>
<p>Ordinary Linux users hate on Windows (and with good reason); Linux
snobs hate with the same intensity on Linux variants that are too easy
to use. Ubuntu is a good target, because it’s so popular. Linux snobs
use <a href="gentoo_winux.html">Gentoo</a>, and compile their
installations from source. Or, better yet, <a
href="pi_minimal.html">build their own Linux from scratch</a>.</p>
<p>But whichever Linux distribution you use, it’s the best, because
<em>you</em> use it, and you wouldn’t use anything but the best.</p>
<p><em>4. Lose all you social skills, if you ever had any</em></p>
<p>For on-line interactions, passive-aggressive is the way to go. For
example, if somebody approaches you for help with a technical problem,
respond in a way that is correct, but incomprehensible to anybody who
doesn’t already know the answer. This is much more fun that actual
rudeness, because the target might be willing to give you the benefit of
the doubt, and assume that you’re not being a dick on purpose. Of
course, actual rudeness is always an option. A good place to practice
your lack of social skills is on the Gentoo forum.</p>
<p>For real-world interactions – no, don’t worry: Linux snobs don’t have
any.</p>
<p><em>5. Use ten-year-old Thinkpads</em></p>
<p>A Linux snob <a href="w520.html">doesn’t use hardware made after
2015</a>. It has to weigh a ton and cost less than £100 on the
second-hand market. Most importantly, it needs to be possible to
dismantle it completely without tools.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that you travel outside your mother’s basement,
it’s not a bad idea to cover your laptop with Penguin stickers, so you
can be sure that everybody knows what’s installed on it.</p>
<p><em>6. Do everything in a terminal</em></p>
<p>Linux snobs never stray far from a command line. Better still, they
find convoluted ways to <a
href="command-line_hacking-groupindex.html">use the command line</a> to
do things that normal people use regular software for.</p>
<p>Better still, <a href="console.html">don’t even have a graphical user
interface at all</a>.</p>
<p><em>7. Use arcane tools like Vim that have to be learned</em></p>
<p>The world is full of good-quality, easy-to-use software. But that’s
of no interest to the Linux snob. Real software must be
<em>learned</em>, ideally over many years. If you need to edit a text
file – and you do, because the Linux snob recognizes no other type of
data – use <a href="vim1.html">Vim</a> or Emacs. First, because they
need only a terminal (see point 6 above). And, second, you need to study
them to use them effectively. If you study Vim for a couple of years,
you’ll be able to do a search-and-replace operation two seconds faster
than with any other editor.</p>
<p><em>8. Find some new development in Linux that few people care about,
and beat on it hard</em></p>
<p>Your best choice here is probably still <a
href="systemd_embedded.html">systemd</a>. It doesn’t really matter
whether you love it or hate it but, as a Linux snob, you can’t be
indifferent. You’ve got to pick a side, and then rubbish everybody on
the other side with all your strength. <a
href="wayland_ground_up.html">Wayland</a> seems to be replacing systemd
as the primary reason for us to froth at our mouths these days. Once
upon a time it was CUPS. Then Gnome. And so on.</p>
<p>Ordinary Linux users don’t care much about these things, one way or
another, which just goes to show how ill-informed they are.</p>
<p><em>9. Spend all your free time ricing</em></p>
<p>‘Ricing’ is a slang term for customizing the user interface. Linux,
of course, offers unmatched opportunities for this kind of time-wasting.
You need to make sure that your Linux desktop looks unlike anybody
else’s, and certainly as unlike the mainstream as possible. Then you
need to do your best to make sure everybody knows it, and waste no
opportunity to mock bland, utilitarian set-ups.</p>
<p>An alternative approach is the ironic one, of making your Linux
system look just like Windows 11. Whatever your approach, however, it
should offer minimal increase in productivity for maximal effort.</p>
<p><em>10. Learn to program in Rust</em></p>
<p>You can’t be a good Linux user if you aren’t a Linux programmer.
Ordinary Linux users – the ones that favour Ubuntu and Mint – get a kick
out of being able to program in Python. C programmers look down on
Python programmers, and Rust programmers look down on everybody.</p>
<p>Once you’ve learned to program in Rust, which shouldn’t take more
than a couple of years with a bit of effort, you can begin to tread the
path of the Rust snob, and re-implement everything in Linux using Rust.
C is for the masses, these days.</p>

<p><em>Note</em><br />
Because people sometimes don’t know when I’m joking: this article is
supposed to be ironic. But, in fact, I am at least a bit of a Linux
snob.</p>
