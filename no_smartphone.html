<h1 id="my-journey-towards-a-smartphone-free-future">My journey towards a smartphone-free future</h1>
<p><img src="img/phone_crossed_out.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>Last year I <a href="degoogle.hrml">divorced Google from my life</a> by installing LineageOS with no Google apps support on my Android phone. This lost me the ability to install any apps that were not open source or, at least, available as APK files to side-load. In fact, I take this to be a gain rather than a loss – this step alone has removed a lot of pointless apps from my life. Still, I continue to find new ways to waste time on my phone: scrolling through news feeds, playing stupid puzzle games, and so on.</p>
<p>So I now regard this move away from Google services as a step on my journey to a completely smartphone-free life. However it may appear, I must point out that I’m not a luddite: I work in the computing industry, and I have a stack of computer equipment, some of which I designed and built myself. Moreover, I have no objection to mobile telephony in general: on the contrary, I think it’s one of most significant, and beneficial inventions in human history. What I don’t like are the time-wasting opportunities that smartphones make almost inevitable, and being part of the surveillance economy.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-there-a-problem">Why is there a problem?</h2>
<p>Why is it so hard to put aside our smartphones?</p>
<p>The modern smartphone is a general-purpose device: apart from telephony it provides Internet access, camera, media, email, navigation and many other things. Replacing a smartphone requires many additional devices, which together are considerably more expensive, as well as inconvenient. Either that, or we must learn to live without certain convenience features that we have come to accept.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I spent my first forty years without a smartphone, and I can’t remember my life being impoverished as a result. So I have to question how much I need these all these capabilities, and what I might be losing by concentrating them into one device.</p>
<p>Smartphones are not yet ubiquitous: I’m told that about 20% of people in the UK don’t have one. Many of these people are elderly, and find this kind of technology unfamiliar. But I know people in their 80s who are welded to their handsets, and teenagers who won’t touch them: it’s not simply a young/old split.</p>
<p>Many businesses and services now offer smartphone apps, which is fine; or insist on them, which is not. Even people who are happy, in general, with using smartphones have complained to me about the sheer number of different apps they need. The situation is not helped by the fact that the apps often don’t work reliably.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the purposes of full disclosure, I have to say that I really can’t manage without a portable music player, so I have <a href="phone_media_player.html">repurposed a smartphone</a> as a media player. This device has no web browser, and I have removed its ability to install new apps. So it’s really only useful as a media player. Still, I can’t claim not to have a smartphone – I’ve just chosen not to use it as such.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Web is full of articles written by people who gave up their smartphones for a month, or two months, or whatever. They generally attest to the positivity of the experience. But even two months isn’t nearly long enough to discover all the things we rely on our smartphones for, and did not even realize.</p>
<p>In this article, I am collecting the things I have struggled with, in my attempts to ditch my smartphone. Some will be obvious; others, perhaps, you’ll only notice when they’re gone.</p>
<p>I’m writing this for other people who are considering embarking on the same adventure: a future without a smartphone. If you’re in that position, it’s as well to be aware of what you’ll be losing. I feel I must point out from the outset that some of the features I rely on in my smartphone have no practical alternative.</p>
<h2 id="mapping">Mapping</h2>
<p>This is one application of a smartphone that I really, truly miss.</p>
<p>I have a satnav in my car, and it works fine. I used to use my smartphone for mapping whilst hiking, not driving, especially in the hills. I used ViewRanger (now Outdoor Active) for planning and guiding hikes. I sometimes used it when I simply got lost in a city centre, and had no printed map.</p>
<p>I can’t do any of this without a smartphone. However, I do have a stand-alone GPS unit specially for hiking. Unlike a smartphone it has a daylight-viewable screen, 50-hour battery life (and it takes common batteries, which my phone does not), and it floats if dropped in a river. It’s altogether a better outdoor navigation companion that Google Maps ever could be. I also have a smart watch (which is less useful that it was, without its companion smartphone app – see below) which can give me a grid reference.</p>
<p>I can plot a route using the ViewRanger website, and copy it to my GPS as a GPX file. This works fine, but it’s a few more manual steps than simply syncing the ViewRanger app to the website.</p>
<p>In the end, though, trying to be rid of my smartphone has made me aware of the risks I’ve been running, taking to the hills with nothing but a electronic device for navigation. I can’t imagine this is something the mountain rescue folks would recommend. So, while I do have a GPS unit, and I will be using it, I will be taking map and compass on the trail in future, as we did in the pre-GPS days.</p>
<h2 id="fitness-tracking">Fitness tracking</h2>
<p>I have a Garmin fitness watch; I use it every day. I have certain training targets that I try to meet, and the watch keeps track of the time I spend exercising in particular heart-rate zones.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to use these watches without a smartphone app. The problem is that the app, even if you have it, isn’t where the magic happens – the app is just a gateway to Garmin’s services. I’m not sure how much I trust Garmin to keep my personal data safe. I used a throw-away email address to register, and I’ve falsified as much personal information I can, without invalidating the computations their system does.</p>
<p>Even if I trust Garmin, I can’t be sure that the Company won’t get bought out, along with all my personal data. That’s what happened to FitBit, after all. Google now holds all the fitness data that FitBit collected. I’m not sure how I feel about that, except relief that I was never a FitBit user.</p>
<p>So, without a smartphone app, my Garmin watch still records the training data, but I needed an app to set it up in the first place. I don’t know whether I would have been able to configure it at all without an app. The watch (or the remote service it’s connected to) needs to know things like my height and weight, to estimate heart rate targets, etc. The device itself does not seem to have a user interface where I can enter these parameters. Now that it’s been set up, I can use a Linux utility to read out the data from my watch onto a computer. This is better, in a way, than using Garmin’s app, because I can process the data as I like. However, I suspect few people will undertake such a task – it’s not hugely convenient.</p>
<p>On reflection, though, I have come to understand that I mostly use the watch because I’m just not well-organized enough to log my exercise activities. I could simply keep this information in a spreadsheet, or even in my diary. It’s easier just to let the watch work it out. In the long term, I’m not sure whether I’ll continue using the Garmin watch when I ditch my smartphone for good: to some extent it just provides a reason for me to avoid tacking my laziness and lack of organization.</p>
<h2 id="two-factor-authentication-support">Two-factor authentication support</h2>
<p>Many businesses and institutions use a smartphone app to control access to their services. The app generates an authentication code that has to be entered into a web-based service, probably along with other credentials. So far, all the businesses I deal with have been able to work around my smartphone deficiency. They can, for example, send an authentication code by SMS. One bank won’t do this but, on my insistence, sent me a hardware authentication card to use instead of an app. This works fine for me.</p>
<p>So far as possible, I will not in the future do business with any organization that requires me to use a smartphone app. There might come a time when this becomes impossible. When that happens, I’m not sure what I’ll do.</p>
<h2 id="camera">Camera</h2>
<p>I don’t usually take photos with my phone. If I’m taking photos, I care how they come out. I use a real camera with proper lenses, that I’ve spent decades learning how to use properly.</p>
<p>If you need to take photos at unpredictable times, and send them away to somebody immediately, I suspect you won’t be able to ditch your smartphone. But even the old flip phones have a camera of some sort – it’s just less convenient, to copy the photos onto a computer to send them to somebody.</p>
<h2 id="weather-forecasts">Weather forecasts</h2>
<p>In the UK, you won’t usually go far wrong if you assume that it’s going to rain later; but unexpected heavy snow has caught out unfortunate hikers.</p>
<p>However, getting an up-to-date forecast requires Internet access, which I don’t usually have in the hills – by their very nature, the places I like to hike have no mobile coverage.</p>
<p>So I can’t really think of an occasion when I will really need a weather forecast, and actually be able to get one, with a smartphone or without.</p>
<p>I appreciate, of course, that this is a bigger deal for some people. And there’s no question that ready access to weather information is convenient in some situations.</p>
<h2 id="tide-forecasts">Tide forecasts</h2>
<p>Look it up before you go! Tide times aren’t going to change from the forecast over a period of a few days.</p>
<h2 id="taxis-etc">Taxis, etc</h2>
<p>I don’t use taxi companies that require a smartphone app. There are still plenty of taxi operators in my neighbourhood which I can hire with a phone call, or just flagging a cab in the street. The app-only firms are a bit cheaper, to be fair. If you’re taking cabs all the time, and spending a lot of money, lack of access to app-based services could be a nuisance.</p>
<h2 id="parking">Parking</h2>
<p>This is becoming an increasing problem. In the UK, many parking operators are moving away from cash payment, to smartphone apps. Some provide an alternative way to make payment, perhaps by a telephone call, but some do not. It’s a particular problem in London.</p>
<p>Parking operators say they do this to save money, but I don’t see any of those savings being passed on to consumers.</p>
<p>I’m not really sure how I feel about this. So far, I’ve rarely had a problem finding somewhere to park. There’s usually some place to park that is either free of charge, or takes coins, even if it’s further from where I want to be. It’s likely that, when this situation gets worse, I will use my bicycle more: I should do that, anyway.</p>
<p>In the long term, though – I just don’t know. I’m hoping that these changes will be rolled back when there are enough complaints, but I’m not all that confident.</p>
<h2 id="alarms">Alarms</h2>
<p>I usually to rely on my smartphone for alarms. Old-fashioned phones can usually raise alarms, but usually not with the same flexibility. Being unable to set an alarm for 7.30PM every second Tuesday is a disadvantage but, for me, not a showstopper. And I have an alarm clock in the bedroom.</p>
<h2 id="calendar-contacts-etc.">Calendar, contacts, etc.</h2>
<p>I’ve gotten used to having my calendar and contact information on my smartphone. I still use a on-line calendar service from my desktop computer (not Google’s). Now I have to carry a paper notebook and a pen, and I have to transfer the data to my computer manually.</p>
<p>I’m investigating other ways to handle this kind of data, that don’t involve a smartphone. To be honest, though, I wouldn’t mind using a paper diary exclusively – that’s what I did for decades, before computers became portable.</p>
<p>What my paper diary won’t do is to alert me when I have an appointment coming up. I have been, again, using a smartphone as a substitute for proper planning.</p>
<h2 id="entrance-to-venues">Entrance to venues</h2>
<p>This is, again, an increasing problem. During the Covid-19 pandemic, many bars, restaurants, and concert venues stopped taking money face-to-face, in favour of remote payment. Generally, the customer would get a barcode or QR code that could be displayed on a smartphone screen, to get access or collect an order.</p>
<p>Sometimes these smartphone codes arrive by email, and can be printed. This is somewhat inconvenient, particularly if you don’t have a printer, but fine for me. Sometimes, though, there’s only an app.</p>
<p>There aren’t many places I want to go to badly enough to break my resolution to avoid the smartphone. I like to hope that businesses will eventually realize that they are losing custom, and behave more inclusively.</p>
<h2 id="social-media">Social media</h2>
<p>Some of the popular social media sites are accessible using a desktop computer rather than a smartphone; some are not. In general, I don’t use social media – I’m old enough to consider the use of computer technology as a business activity, not a social one. But a number of charitable and social organizations I’ve been involved with in the past now organize themselves entirely using WhatsApp, and that more-or-less excludes me.</p>
<p>Oddly, this even includes a choir that specializes in renaissance music. The average age of members of this choir was about fifty, and about half the singers did not have smartphones. The advantages of using social media for organization are obvious. The disadvantage is that you could lose a large part of you membership, which is more-or-less what happened to the choir.</p>
<p>Because I’ve never been much of a social media fan, being unable to use it has been mostly not had a significant impact. However, the move to social media by voluntary and charitable organizations is a lamentable one, because there’s never enough volunteers, and we really don’t want to discourage them.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder if these kinds of organizations emphasize social media in a deliberate attempt to recruit ‘the youth’? If it is, it probably won’t work: among the people who have decided to ditch their smartphones, there are as many under 30s as over 50s.</p>
<p>For all that, if you’re a significant social media consumer, the lack of a smartphone is likely to be a disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="news-and-feeds">News and feeds</h2>
<p>One of the first things I’ve generally done each day is to look at news feeds on my smartphone. I can do this just as well on a desktop computer – but I typically don’t because, when I’m sitting at my computer, I’m working.</p>
<p>This is one of those applications of a smartphone that seem to offer a modicum of convenience, with few negative connotations. But, at the same time, the convenience really is a modest one. I have many other sources of news.</p>
<h2 id="email-and-messaging">Email and messaging</h2>
<p>Email has conventionally been the most effective way to contact me, whatever the time of day, or wherever I was. My smartphone handles email pretty well – even now it’s degoogled. I’ve gotten used to checking my email regularly, or whenever my smartphone nags me, which is all the time.</p>
<p>Without a smartphone, the best way to contact will be by SMS message. I’ll still be using email, of course, but not when I’m away from home. The problem with SMS is that it’s fiddly to send anything other than text.</p>
<p>Many people use ‘instant’ messaging services, that are often associated with social media sites. With a smartphone, these services will not be usable. But social media messaging services are no more ‘instant’ than email, nor any easier to use. Still, I can’t control the way other people choose to communicate, and my preferences definitely make me less contactable. I am unclear, at present, whether that will turn out to be a good thing or a bad one in the long term.</p>
<h2 id="card-scanners">Card scanners</h2>
<p>Some people I know use card-scanning apps to store business cards, membership cards, and similar items on their smartphones. As a person who tends to be a little forgetful, I can see why that would be useful. I don’t think I’d want to store scans of my credit cards on a smartphone, but it would be useful to store membership cards.</p>
<p>I can’t think of an alternative to an app for this, except to be better organized.</p>
<h2 id="games">Games</h2>
<p>The ability to play games on a smartphone is, to me, a wholly negative thing. I do not at all miss being unable to do so. But if you’re a gamer, you’ll need to make alternative arrangements.</p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>If there is an inexpensive, portable music player that handles both local files (in modern formats) and remote streaming services, I haven’t found one. My Astell and Kern player can do all these things, but it’s hardly portable, and certainly not inexpensive.</p>
<p>This is why I have repurposed a small smartphone as a media player. It’s a shame nobody seems to make a decent portable media player these days. It’s hardly surprising, given the ubiquity of smartphones, but still disappointing.</p>
<h2 id="ebooks">Ebooks</h2>
<p>I have, from time to time, read novels on my smartphone. It’s not an ideal platform for this, but I’ve sometimes found that I have my smartphone, and don’t have anything else.</p>
<p>I have a Kobo e-reader, and it’s superior to a smartphone for reading, in just about all respects. But it’s an additional expense, and I have to remember to take it with me.</p>
<h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h2>
<p>As I’ve moved away from using a smartphone, I’ve become aware that many of the reasons I used it were compensation for my laziness and lack of planning. There are, undoubtedly, some really useful smartphone applications – mapping and calendar management are particularly significant for me. It would be good if we could have these positive things without all the negative ones.</p>
<p>At present, though, I don’t think we can. If you use a smartphone, you’re buying into the whole package – the good things and the bad.</p>
