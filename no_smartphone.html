<h1 id="my-stumbling-journey-towards-a-smartphone-free-future">My
stumbling journey towards a smartphone-free future</h1>
<p><img src="img/phone_crossed_out.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>Last year I <a href="degoogle.html">divorced Google from my life</a>
by installing LineageOS with no Google services on my Android phone.
This lost me the ability to install any apps that were not open source
or, at least, available as APK files to side-load. I take this inability
to install apps to be a gain rather than a loss – this step alone has
removed a lot of pointless apps from my life. Still, I continue to find
new ways to waste time on my phone: scrolling through news feeds,
playing stupid puzzle games, and so on.</p>
<p>I now regard this move away from Google as the first step on my
journey to a completely smartphone-free life. However it may appear, I
should point out that I’m not a luddite: I worked most of my life in the
computing industry, and I have a stack of computer equipment, some of
which I designed and built. I’ve developed Android apps myself.
Moreover, I have no objection to mobile telephony in general: on the
contrary, I think it’s one of the most significant, beneficial
inventions in human history. What I don’t like are the time-wasting
opportunities that smartphones make almost inevitable, and I
<i>really</i> don’t want to be part of the surveillance economy.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-there-a-problem">Why is there a problem?</h2>
<p>It should be as simple as this: if you want a smartphone, have one;
if you don’t, don’t. Why do we not have this simple choice any more?</p>
<p>The modern smartphone is a general-purpose device: apart from
telephony it provides Internet access, camera, media, email, navigation
and many other things. Replacing a smartphone requires additional
devices which, taken together, are considerably more expensive, as well
as being less convenient. Either that, or we must learn to live without
certain useful features that we have come to rely on.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I spent my first forty years without a smartphone, and
I can’t remember my life being impoverished as a result. So I have to
question how much I need these all these technological capabilities, and
what I might be losing by concentrating them into one device.</p>
<p>Smartphones are not yet ubiquitous: I’m told that about 20% of people
in the UK don’t have one. Many of these people are elderly, and find
this kind of technology unfamiliar. But I know people in their 80s who
are welded to their handsets, and teenagers who won’t touch them without
rubber gloves: it’s not a simple young/old split.</p>
<p>There’s a problem because, as the uptake of smartphones has
increased, the number of businesses and services that are willing to
cater to the smartphone-deficient has decreased. It’s clearly cheaper
for a business to provide a fully-automated smartphone interface than a
human contact. Still, the fact that many businesses and services now
offer smartphone apps is fine; that so many offer nothing else is not.
Even people who are happy, in general, with using smartphones complain
about the sheer number of different apps they need, and how unreliable
they often are.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the purposes of full disclosure, I have to say that I really
can’t live without a portable music player, so I have <a
href="phone_media_player.html">repurposed a smartphone</a> as a media
player. This device has no web browser, and I have removed its ability
to install apps. So it’s really only useful as a media player. Still, I
can’t claim not to have a smartphone at all – I’ve just chosen to
disable all its communications features. I live in (not much) hope that
one day real portable media players will be a thing again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Web is full of articles written by people who gave up their
smartphones for a month, or two months, or whatever. They generally
attest to the positivity of the experience. But even two months isn’t
nearly long enough to discover all the things we rely on our smartphones
for.</p>
<p>In this article, I collect details of my struggles with attempting to
ditch my smartphone. Some will be obvious: mapping, for example. Others,
perhaps, relate to smartphone features that I use only occasionally, and
whose absense only because problematic after a period of months.</p>
<p>I’m writing this for other people who are considering embarking on
the same adventure: a future without a smartphone. If you’re in that
position, it’s as well to be aware of what you’ll be losing, so you can
make alternative arrangements or, at least, begin the grieving process.
I have to point out from the outset that <em>some of the features I rely
on in my smartphone have no practical</em> <em>alternative</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The issue of smartphone use, particularly social media use, among
children is a complex one, and something I won’t address at all. There
are many on-line resources for parents who are worried about this issue.
See, for example, <a href="https://www.kidsfornow.org.uk/">Kids for
Now</a> and <a
href="https://smartphonefreechildhood.co.uk/">Smartphone-Free
Childhood</a>. I suspect that adults who want to get rid of their
smartphones, have different concerns from those which affect
children.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="mapping">Mapping</h2>
<p>This is one application of a smartphone that I truly miss.</p>
<p>I have a satnav in my car, and it works fine. But I used to use my
smartphone for mapping whilst hiking, especially in the hills. I used
ViewRanger (now OutdoorActive) for planning and guiding hikes. I
sometimes used it when I simply got lost in a city centre, and had no
printed map.</p>
<p>I can’t do any of this without a smartphone. However, I do have a
stand-alone GPS unit specially for hiking. Unlike a smartphone it has a
daylight-viewable screen, 50-hour battery life (and it takes common
batteries, which my phone does not), and it floats if dropped in a
river. It’s altogether a better outdoor navigation companion that Google
Maps ever could be. I also have a smart watch (which is less useful that
it once was, without its companion app) that can give me a grid
reference.</p>
<p>I can plot a route using the ViewRanger website, and copy it to my
GPS as a GPX file. This works fine, but it’s a few more manual steps
than simply syncing the ViewRanger Android app wth the website.</p>
<p>In the end, though, trying to be rid of my smartphone has made me
aware of the risks I’ve been taking, setting off into the hills with
nothing but an electronic device for navigation. I can’t imagine this is
something the mountain rescue folks would recommend. So, while I do have
a GPS unit, and I will be using it, I will be taking map and compass on
the trail in future, as we did in the pre-GPS days.</p>
<p>For urban navigation, I really have no solution, except to print or
draw a map in advance. It’s still possible to get commercial printed map
booklets for major cities; for smaller localities you may have to rely
on your memory or your printer, or pencil and paper.</p>
<h2 id="fitness-tracking">Fitness tracking</h2>
<p>I have a Garmin fitness watch; I use it every day. I have certain
training targets that I try to meet, and the watch keeps track of the
time I spend exercising in particular heart-rate zones.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to use these watches without a smartphone app. The app
isn’t where the magic happens: it’s just a gateway to the device
vendor’s service. Still, something has to feed data from the watch to
that service, and I know of no way to do that, except using the app.</p>
<p>Without an app, my Garmin watch still records the training data, and
I can download it to my computer, and use software to process it. And
this is, in fact, what I now do. Having become familiar with the
process, I prefer it, to the app-based method, and it raises no privacy
concerns.</p>
<p>However, I needed an Android app to set the watch up in the first
place. It needs to know things like my height and weight, to estimate
heart rate targets, etc. The device itself does not seem to have a user
interface where I can enter these parameters. If I bought a new one now,
I’m not sure I could set it up at all.</p>
<p>On reflection, though, I have come to understand that I mostly use
the watch because I’m just not well-organized enough to log my exercise
activities. I could simply keep this information in a spreadsheet, or
even in a diary. It’s been easier just to let the watch work it out. In
the long term, I’m not sure whether I’ll continue using the Garmin watch
when I ditch my smartphone for good: to some extent it just provides a
reason for me to avoid tackling my laziness and lack of
organization.</p>
<h2 id="two-factor-authentication-support">Two-factor authentication
support</h2>
<p>Many businesses and institutions use a smartphone app to control
access to their services. The app generates an authentication code that
has to be entered into a web-based service, probably along with other
credentials. So far, all the businesses I deal with have been able to
work around my smartphone deficiency. They can, for example, send an
authentication code by SMS. My bank won’t do this but, on my insistence,
they sent me a hardware authentication gadget to use instead of an app.
This works fine for me. But I had to threaten to take my business
elsewhere to get it.</p>
<p>So far as possible, I will not in the future do business with an
organization that requires me to use a smartphone app. There might come
a time when this becomes impossible. When that happens, I’m not sure
what I’ll do.</p>
<h2 id="camera">Camera</h2>
<p>I don’t usually take photos with my phone. If I’m taking photos, I
care how they come out. I use a real camera with proper lenses, that
I’ve spent decades learning how to use properly.</p>
<p>If you need to take photos at unpredictable times, and send them away
to somebody immediately, I suspect you won’t be able to ditch your
smartphone. But even the old flip phones have a camera of some sort –
it’s just less convenient to copy the photos onto a computer to send
them to somebody.</p>
<p>Such a camera will be good enough for recording the licence-plate
number of the car that’s just reversed into you in the supermarket car
park. If you’re the kind of person who likes to take photos of you meals
and share them with friends, you’re probably out of luck.</p>
<h2 id="weather-forecasts">Weather forecasts</h2>
<p>In the UK, you won’t usually go far wrong if you assume that it’s
going to rain later; but unexpected heavy snow has caught out
unfortunate hikers.</p>
<p>However, getting an up-to-date forecast requires Internet access,
which I don’t usually have in the hills – by their very nature, the
places I like to hike have no mobile coverage. So I can’t really think
of an occasion when I will really need a weather forecast, and will
actually be able to get one, with a smartphone or without.</p>
<p>I appreciate, of course, that this is a bigger deal for some people.
And there’s no question that ready access to weather information is
convenient in some situations.</p>
<h2 id="tide-forecasts">Tide forecasts</h2>
<p>Look it up before you go: tide times aren’t going to change from the
forecast over a period of a few days.</p>
<h2 id="taxis-etc">Taxis, etc</h2>
<p>I don’t use taxi companies that require a smartphone app. There are
still plenty of taxi operators in my neighbourhood who I can hire with a
phone call, or just by flagging down a cab in the street. The app-only
firms are a bit cheaper, to be fair. If you’re taking cabs all the time,
and spending a lot of money, lack of access to app-based services could
be a nuisance.</p>
<h2 id="parking">Parking</h2>
<p>This is becoming a significant problem. In the UK, many parking
operators are moving away from cash payment, to smartphone apps. Some
provide an alternative way to make payment, perhaps by a telephone call,
but some do not. It’s a particular problem in the outer London
regions.</p>
<p>Parking operators say they do this to save money, but I don’t see any
of those alleged savings being passed on to consumers.</p>
<p>I’m not really sure how I feel about this. So far, I’ve rarely had a
problem finding somewhere to park. There’s usually some place to park
that is either free of charge, or takes coins, even if it’s further from
where I want to be. It’s likely that, when this situation gets worse, I
will use my bicycle more: I should do that, anyway.</p>
<p>In the long term, though – I just don’t know. I’m hoping that these
changes will be rolled back when there are enough complaints, but I’m
not all that confident. People with mobility problems are really
starting to struggle.</p>
<h2 id="alarms">Alarms</h2>
<p>I used to rely on my smartphone for alarms. Old-fashioned phones can
usually raise alarms, but usually not with the same flexibility. Being
unable to set an alarm for 7.30PM every second Tuesday is a disadvantage
but, for me, not a showstopper. And I have an alarm clock in the
bedroom.</p>
<h2 id="calendar-contacts-etc.">Calendar, contacts, etc.</h2>
<p>I’ve gotten used to having my calendar and contact information on my
smartphone, although I still use an on-line calendar service from my
desktop computer (not Google’s). Without a smartphone I have to carry a
paper notebook and a pen, and I have to transfer the data to my computer
manually.</p>
<p>I’m investigating other ways to handle this kind of data, that don’t
involve a smartphone. To be honest, though, I wouldn’t mind using a
paper diary exclusively – that’s what I did for decades, before
computers became portable.</p>
<p>What my paper diary won’t do is to alert me when I have an
appointment coming up. I have been, again, using a smartphone as a
substitute for proper planning. I can’t deny, however, that lack of a
smartphone is a significant disadvantage here.</p>
<h2 id="entrance-to-venues">Entrance to venues</h2>
<p>This is increasingly a problem in many parts of the UK. During the
Covid-19 pandemic, many bars, restaurants, and concert venues stopped
taking money face-to-face, in favour of remote payment. Generally, the
customer would get a barcode or QR code that could be displayed on a
smartphone screen, to get access or collect an order. Sadly, even though
Covid is no longer the horror it once was, many venues have continued to
operate the same way.</p>
<p>Sometimes ther smartphone codes arrive by email, and can be printed.
This is somewhat inconvenient, particularly if you don’t have a printer,
but fine for me. Sometimes, though, there’s only an app.</p>
<p>There aren’t many places I want to go to badly enough to break my
resolution to avoid the smartphone. I like to hope that businesses will
eventually realize that they are losing custom, and behave more
inclusively.</p>
<h2 id="airline-travel">Airline travel</h2>
<p>I recently flew from Bergen in Norway to Amsterdam. This was the
first time I encountered an airport that seemed to be completely
unstaffed. The baggage drop and check-in were completely automated, and
driven by bar-codes. I had checked in on-line the day before, and I had
printed my bar-code, so it was fine. But if I had not had a printer
available, and didn’t have a smartphone to display the bar-code, I could
have been stuck.</p>
<p>There must – surely – have been a staffed check-in desk somewhere,
but I didn’t see one. This wasn’t a problem I had at Heathrow: although
there’s little to be said in favour of Heathrow Airport, it was at least
staffed.</p>
<p>I don’t fly often, and I imagine it will be even less often when
there is no way to travel without a smartphone.</p>
<h2 id="social-media">Social media</h2>
<p>Some of the popular social media sites are accessible using a desktop
computer rather than a smartphone; most are not. In general, I don’t use
social media – I consider the use of computer technology to be primarily
a business activity, not a leisure one. But a number of charitable and
social organizations I’ve been involved with in the past now organize
themselves entirely using WhatsApp, which excludes me.</p>
<p>Oddly, this even includes a choir with which I used to sing, that
specializes in renaissance music. The average age of singers in this
choir was about fifty, and about half did not have smartphones. The
advantages of using social media for organization are obvious. The
disadvantage is that you could lose a large part of your membership,
which is more-or-less what happened to the choir.</p>
<p>Because I’ve never been much of a social media fan, being unable to
use it has not really changed anything. However, the move to social
media by voluntary and charitable organizations is a lamentable one,
because there’s never enough volunteers, and we really don’t want to
discourage them.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder if these kinds of organizations emphasize social
media in a deliberate attempt to recruit ‘the youth’? If it is, it
probably won’t work: among the people who have decided to ditch their
smartphones, there are as many under 30s as over 50s.</p>
<p>For all that, if you’re a significant social media consumer, the lack
of a smartphone is likely to be a crushing disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="news-and-feeds">News and feeds</h2>
<p>One of the first things I’ve generally done each day is to look at
news feeds on my smartphone. I can do this just as well on a desktop
computer – but I typically don’t because, when I’m sitting at my
computer, I’m working. In the pre-smartphone days, I would have read a
print newspaper over breakfast, but it’s cheaper and less intrusive to
read a screen.</p>
<p>This is one of those applications of a smartphone that seem to offer
a modicum of convenience, with few negative connotations. But, at the
same time, the convenience really is a modest one. I have many other
sources of news.</p>
<h2 id="email-and-messaging">Email and messaging</h2>
<p>Email has conventionally been the most effective way to contact me,
whatever the time of day, or wherever I was. My smartphone handles email
pretty well, even after degoogling. I’ve gotten used to checking my
email regularly, or whenever my smartphone nagged me, which was all the
time.</p>
<p>Without a smartphone, the best way to contact me urgently is by SMS
message. I still use email, of course, but not when I’m away from my
computer. The problem with SMS is that it’s fiddly to send anything
other than text.</p>
<p>Many people use ‘instant’ messaging services, that are often
associated with social media sites. Without smartphone, these services
will not be usable. But social media messaging services are no more
‘instant’ than email, nor any easier to use. Still, I can’t control the
way other people choose to communicate, and my preferences definitely
make me less contactable. I am unclear, at present, whether that will
turn out to be a good thing or a bad one in the long term.</p>
<h2 id="card-scanners">Card scanners</h2>
<p>Some people I know use card-scanning apps to store business cards,
membership cards, and similar items on their smartphones. As a person
who tends to be a little forgetful, I can see why that would be useful.
I don’t think I’d want to store scans of my credit cards on a
smartphone, but it would be useful to store membership cards.</p>
<p>I can’t think of an alternative to an app for this, except to be
better organized in general.</p>
<h2 id="games">Games</h2>
<p>The ability to play games on a smartphone is, to me, a wholly
negative thing. I do not at all miss being unable to do so. But if
you’re a gamer, you’ll need to make alternative arrangements.</p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>If there is an inexpensive, portable music player that handles both
locally-stored files (in modern formats) and remote streaming services,
I haven’t found one. My Astell and Kern player can do both these things
well, but it’s hardly portable, and certainly not inexpensive.</p>
<p>This is why I have repurposed a small smartphone as a media player.
It’s a shame nobody seems to make a decent, affordable portable media
player these days. It’s hardly surprising, given the ubiquity of
smartphones, but it’s still disappointing.</p>
<p>If you only want to play locally-stored audio files (rips of CDs, for
example), you’re not completely out of luck. Old-style “MP3 players” are
still available at reasonable prices, both new and used. Often these
only support wired headphones; that isn’t a problem for me, although I
accept that it will be a nuisance for many.</p>
<p>If you want to play streaming music services using Bluetooth
headphones, I suspect it’s going to be hard to avoid a smartphone.</p>
<h2 id="e-books">E-books</h2>
<p>I have, from time to time, read novels on my smartphone. It’s not an
ideal platform for this, but sometimes my smartphone is all I’ve had
with me.</p>
<p>I have a Kobo e-reader, and it’s superior to a smartphone for
reading, in just about all respects. But it’s an additional expense, and
I have to remember to take it with me.</p>
<h2 id="health-monitoring-devices">Health monitoring devices</h2>
<p>In the last five years or so we’ve seen increased availability of
home health monitoring devices: ECG recorders, oxygen saturation
devices, 24-hour blood pressure monitors, and so on.</p>
<p>Not all of these devices have a user interface or display, or provide
a way to transfer data to a computer for analysis. Instead, consumer
devices usually have to synchronize with a smartphone app – even if you
want to use some other application to process the data. I don’t really
see a viable alternative to a smartphone, if you want to use these
consumer medical devices.</p>
<h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h2>
<p>As I’ve moved away from using a smartphone, I’ve realized that many
of my reasons for using one are merely compensation for my laziness and
lack of planning. There are, undoubtedly, some really useful smartphone
applications – mapping and calendar management are particularly
significant for me. It would be good if we could have these positive
things without all the negative ones but, so far, this seems to be
impossible. If you use a smartphone, you’re buying into the whole
package – the good things and the bad.</p>
<p>Particularly worrying is the fact that essential services might one
day be unavailable to anybody who doesn’t want to use a smartphone. I
can only hope that, by that time, Governments will have legislated to
restrict the use of covert surveillance by smartphone vendors and their
partners in crime.</p>
