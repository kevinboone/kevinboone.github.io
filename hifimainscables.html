<h1>Why you can't improve your hi-fi system by upgrading the mains cable</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/snakeoil.png" 
  alt="snake oil"/>

It's almost impossible to believe, if you have even the most rudimentary
understanding of electronics, but you can actually spend more than
&pound;400 on a mains cable for your hi-fi system. It's not clear to
me whether the people who manufacturer and sell these products genuinely
think they offer the benefits they claim, or whether it's all just
a cynical ruse to part the gullible from their cash. Are they
sitting around in their offices, 
giggling behind their hands at the gullibility of  purchasers? 
Or do their claims stand
up to any kind of scientific scrutiny at all?
</p>

<h2>Resistance</h2>

<p>
The most common claim for the efficacy of premium mains cables 
is that they have conductors with exceptionally low electrical
resistance. Could this be possible? 
</p>
<p>
Well, yes. Electrical resistance can be decreased in a number of
ways, most obviously by making the conductors thicker. Resistance
per unit length is (at mains frequencies) inversely proportional
to the conductor area -- double the area, halve the resistance. 
It's also possible to use exotic materials: silver is more
conductive than copper, gold more conductive still. To the best
of my knowledge nobody makes entire cables out of gold (yet) --
it would be fabulously expensive even by ridiculous standards
we're considering here. Still, increasing conductor area
is a straightforward way to reduce electrical resistance.  
</p>
<p>
So a thicker, heavier, and thus more expensive, cable could have
a lower electrical resistance than a cheap one. Here's the problem,
though -- we generally don't power our hi-fi systems with a power 
station in the same rack (yet). The mains cable plugs into 
a domestic electrical socket which connects to a fuse box
which connects to an area transformer which connects to a regional
transformer which connects to... well, it hardly matters.  
</p>
<p>
What actually matters is how the electrical resistance of the mains cable
compares with that of the electrical supply as a whole. We can't easily 
measure the supply resistance (although there is specialist equipment that
can), but in the UK it's usually taken to be between 0.1 
and 0.5 ohms at the subscriber's switchboard. If we assume that there is 20m of
mains cabling between the switchboard and the electrical outlet,
that will add about 0.4 ohms to the total resistance at
the outlet. So the total
supply resistance at the electrical outlet can be taken to be 
0.5-0.9 ohms. The
electrical resistance of one metre of perfectly standard mains
flex is about 0.02 ohms. So the mains cable from the outlet
to the hi-fi equipment 
contributes at maximum 0.02/(0.02+0.4+0.1) = 4% of the overall
resistance, and at minimum 0.02/(0.02+0.4+0.5) = 2%. 
</p>
<p>
If a premium cable had -- and let's be generous here -- one quarter
the resistance of the regular cable, then it would contribute about 0.5%
-1% of the overall resistance of the electrical supply to the equipment. 
Another way
of looking at this is to see that that overall electrical resistance
of the system can only be reduced by 0.02 ohms <i>at best</i> because
that's what would be achieved by a super-conducting cable -- one with
no resistance at all. 
</p>
<p>
Still, a reduction in electrical resistance of the order 2% or
so, although small, is still a reduction. We could measure that, if
we had sensitive enough equipment. But is there any reason to think this
will have any effect on sound quality? 
</p>
<p>
Frankly, it's not easy to see how. The reason for this is that power
amplifiers -- the components usually claimed to benefit most from 
improved mains cables -- are unaffected by mains supply resistance. Let's
see why.  
</p>
<p>
The amplifier is driving two speakers (perhaps more) with a nominal 
resistance of 8 ohms. That popular "8 ohm" figure is an impedance, really,
not a resistance -- speakers are essentially conductors at DC. Still,
that distinction is a technicality here. The amplifier is driving an
overall load resistance of 4 ohms (two 8 ohm speakers effectively in
parallel) with a source resistance of about 1 ohm. That's like
filling up a gardener's watering can with a fire hose. A one percent,
or even a ten percent, improvement in the flow in the fire hose isn't 
going to make any appreciable difference. 
</p>
<p>
It's fair to say that, in certain conditions, the effective 
resistance of the
speakers drops dramatically. This is particularly true for very low-frequency
transients (the pluck of a bass guitar, for example). The resistance
of the speakers in that situation might be as low as 1 ohm. In that
situation the supply of power to the amplifier becomes critically
important, but there are two reasons why it's not affected by the mains
cable.
</p>
<p>
First, in a situation like this, a fractional change in the cable
resistance will have no appreciable benefit -- there simply isn't 
enough energy in the system even if the mains cable were a 
superconductor.
</p>
<p>
Second, amplifier designers are aware of this problem -- they've had at
least seventy years to work on it. The typical solution is to 
fit the amplifier with enormous capacitors to store energy that
can be discharged into the speakers when there are transients.
These capacitors are the <i>specific</i> solution to the problem
of insufficient energy supply and, if they are inadequate, the 
deficiency will not be made good by a miniscule change in supply
resistance.
</p>
<p>
In short, reduced resistance as an explanation for the efficacy of
premium mains cables is busted.
</p>

<h2>Electrical interference</h2>

<p>
Premium mains cables are usually provided with conductive shielding
around the power conductors. This shielding may or may not
be connected to some kind of ground -- perhaps the earth terminal
of the plug. The 'faraday cage' effect does not rely on grounding
for its reduction in magnetic coupling; but straightforward capacitive
coupling -- if it even exists in a mains cable -- might be affected
by grounding.
</p>

<p>
Here is what one manufacturer has to say about the product:
</p>

<blockquote>
"The main benefit is the shielding which helps to ensure that other low 
level signal cables are not affected by the close proximity of the [...]
mains cable - induced RF interference has been one of the biggest bug-bears of high quality audio and video reproduction [...]
</blockquote>

<p>
There are two effects that need to be considered here, and at a range
of different frequencies. First, we need to think about noise being
coupled into the equipment that has been induced into the mains
cable. Second, there's the question whether the mains cable can itself
induce noise into nearby equipment.
</p>
<p>
There's no question that a domestic electrical outlet is electrically
noisy, at a huge range of frequencies. At the low end of the spectrum
is the 50Hz frequency of the mains itself. In the middle of the
range we have electromagnetic signals from radio, television, etc. Then
at the top of the band there are microwave signals from mobile phones
and wifi equipment. This noise is <i>on the mains conductors</i>, 
because it is on every piece of material that is capable of carrying
an electrical current. For better or worse, that's the world we
now live in.
</p>
<p>
Can the shielding prevent mains-born interference being electromagnetically
coupled to nearby equipment? Well, yes, probably. But it's too late
-- the noise has been coupled into the equipment directly on the mains
cable: induced noise is irrelevant when that happens. 
No amount of shielding will change this -- it's like
locking the axe-murderer in the house with you, rather than outside.
</p>
<p>
So can the shielding prevent interference being coupled into the 
mains cable? Well, again, yes; but it's worth asking what difference
that will make, if the supply is itself polluted.
</p>
<p>
The solution to the problem of RF interference in hi-fi equipment
-- if there is a problem at all -- is mains filtration. That is,
the provision of high-frequency filters right in the mains conductors,
and as close to the equipment as possible. But wait -- the equipment 
designers have already thought of that -- this kind of filtration
is perfectly common-place in the power supply circuits of decent
hi-fi equipment. If yours doesn't have it, you can buy an inline
supply filter for about Â£10. 
</p>
<p>
Now, in the interests of fairness, I should point out that RF induction
is a strange phenomenon. It isn't always easy to predict how it will
behave in practical set-ups. It's impossible to say for certain that
shielding your mains cable won't have some effect. However, the 
unpredictability of RF behaviour is such that the effect, if there is
one, is just as likely to be negative as positive. If you really
do have a problem with RF interference, it's unlikely that shielding
your mains cable is going to help. But don't take my word for it --
you can wrap your existing mains cable with aluminum foils -- which is
a decent conductor -- for a minimal sum and try it for yourself.
</p>

<h2>Oxygen-free copper (and similar)</h2>

<p>
A common claim of premium cables -- not specifically mains cables, but
all kinds of cables -- is that they are made of oxygen-free copper (OFC)
or some other extraordinary material. OFC materials do not have a
substantially different overall conductivity than ordering copper at
audio frequencies so, if they have any benefit, it doesn't arise
from the ordinary bulk properties of the material. One proponent says:
</p>
<blockquote>
"Copper purity affects its crystal structure and the accuracy of phase
transmission, which is not dependent on tiny differences in conductivity,
meaning resistance."
</blockquote>
<p>
I'm not at all sure what the 'accuracy of phase transmission' is, but
it clearly has something to do with the propagation of a signal.
I'm sceptical about the benefits of OFC and similar substances in a
signal path, but that's irrelevant here because <i>the mains cable
carries no signal</i>.  
</p>
<p>
Oxygen-free copper: busted (at least in mains cables).
</p>



<h2>Length. Length??</h2>

<p>
One product has as its main selling point it's <i>length</i>. It's 
specifically 1.65m long, because: 
</p>

<blockquote>
"Listening tests showed consistently that the best sound quality was obtain 
(<i>sic</i>) from cables cut to a length of 1.65m [...] This aligns very closely with 
the quarter wavelength of the 50 Hz mains frequency of 1.7m"
</blockquote>

Well, leaving aside the question of why the 50Hz mains frequency is
relevant, it's worth asking what <i>exactly</i> has a quarter wavelength
of 1.7m at 50Hz. It's certainly not an electro-magnetic wave in
an electrical cable. In general

<blockquote>
wavelength (metres) = speed of propagation (metres/sec) / frequency (Hz)
</blockquote>

<p>
The speed of propagation of an electromagnetic wave in cable is
of the order 2x10<sup>8</sup> m/sec. It's not quite the speed of
light, because the propagation is affected by the dielectric properties
of the cable, but it's in that region. So the wavelength at 50Hz
is 4,200 km. Yes, that's kilometres. What <i>does</i> have a quarter 
wavelength of 1.7m at 50Hz is a <i>sound</i> wave, propagating in
air. The speed of propagation is about 343 m/sec, so 343/50/4 = 1.715 metres.
</p>

<p>
But so what? No actual sound travels (we hope) in the mains cable; and, even if
it did, the propagation velocity would not be the same as in air.
And even if it were, it's not remotely clear how 
the wavelength would be relevant, at any frequency, let alone 50Hz.
</p>

<p>
The manufacturer seems to want us to believe that somehow the mains
electrical energy has to be coupled into the hi-fi equipment by a process
of impedance matching, as happens in radio-frequency antenna
circuits. But, even if that were true -- and of course it isn't --
 the wavelengths are 
completely wrong -- wrong by factors of a thousand or more, for
the length of 1.7m to be relevant.
</p>

<p>
Of all the claims that are made for mains cables, this one is just
so utterly absurd that I can't believe it was ever seriously made.
</p>

<h2>What's really going on here?</h2>

<p>
None of the mechanisms claimed by manufacturers for 
the efficacy of premium mains cables stands up to any rigorous analysis.
If these products work, the explanation is in the same class
as that for
<a href="homeopathy.html">homeopathy</a> -- sympathetic magic, or its
contemporary equivalent, the placebo effect. 
</p>
<p>
I've known many people -- a number that surprises me -- who claim
that their cars run better when they are clean and shiny. There
really isn't any scientific explanation for this, either but, presumably,
the effect is there, because it's an effect on a person's perception. 
In the end, this is personal enjoyment we're talking about, not 
a Mars mission. 
</p>
<p>
There's an intriguing story in Robert Pirsig's
<i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> about the
owner of a brand new bike who found that the handlebars were loose in 
the yokes. This made the machine difficult to ride and, presumably,
less enjoyable.  The author's proposed solution
was to cut a beer can into strips, and bolt the
strips under the handlebar mounts. This, it seems, was something
that the frustrated biker was not prepared to do with 
his shiny new motorcycle. Instead,
he purchased a set of branded handlebar shims from a specialist supplier at,
we presume, considerable expense. In the end, the branded shims 
were made of exactly the same material as the beer cans, and both 
would have been invisible when installed. 
</p>
<p>
I don't know if this story is true, but it certainly sounds plausible.
We develop attachments to our possessions, and the pleasure we take
in them is only loosely related to the function they fulfil. I own
many things which have no discernible function at all -- probably we
all do. Part of the pleasure of owning a top-shelf hi-fi system is
the knowledge that everything about it is as perfect as it can 
possibly be. We can't easily change the distance of our houses 
from the power station, but we can do what little we can by fitting
a better mains cable.
</p>
<p>
More cynically, I suspect that if you spend a lot of money on
a premium mains cable you <i>have</i> to hear a difference
in the sound. If you don't, 
it's hard to avoid having to conclude that you're a fool.
