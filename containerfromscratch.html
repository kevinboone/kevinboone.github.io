<h1>Container from scratch: building a Linux container from the ground up</h1>

<p>

It's all about containers these days. Containers are a fundamental part of
the microservices model of development, providing isolated runtimes
for application components. Containers can 
run one operating system version inside another, maintain
self-contained applications that would otherwise conflict with their
hosts, and allow multiple versions of the same application to be 
tested on the same machine. 
</p>
<p>
In the Linux world, there are many technologies for building and
running containers: LXC, Docker, buildah, podman, and others. 
If containers are useful, then assemblies of containers are even
more useful. There are a number of frameworks for orchestrating
large numbers of containers -- Kubernetes is probably the best-known.
</p>
<p>
Container managers like podman seem hugely sophisticated and, indeed,
they are. However, the core features that all these tools rely on
are, in fact, built into the Linux kernel already. What the tools
really do is to provide convenient, friendly interfaces to kernel
services like namespaces, virtual networks, and control groups. 
</p>
<p>
This series of articles sets out to demonstrate how a Linux container
infrastructure works, using only command-line tools. We won't be
able to build general-purpose, production-quality container
tooling this way, but we <i>will</i> be able to understand exactly
how the mainstream tools do what they do.
<p>
</p>
If you want to run 
the demonstrations in these articles you'll need the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>a relatively modern Linux system with cgroups and namespaces 
enabled in the kernel. In most modern distributions this support is enabled by default, but in some cases (Raspberry Pi in particular) you will need additional set-up. I've tested the demonstrations on Fedora 30 and Devuan 'Beowulf'.
I suspect any relatively mainstream Linux from the last five years or
so will be fine. You'll need the command-line utilities 
<code>unshare</code> and <code>ip</code> for some of the demonstrations;</p></li>
<li><p>a way to run commands in separate sessions -- two terminal sessions on a Linux desktop will be sufficient;</p></li>
<li><p>you'll need <code>root</code> access on the Linux system;</p></li>
<li><p>if you want to prove that memory control works by running the sample
C code I provide later, you'll need a C compiler, such as <code>gcc</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
These articles assume a fairly high level of Linux knowledge. I
assume that the reader is comfortable working at the command line, and
doing configuration by editing text files. I've really written these
articles for developers and administrators who already use 
tools like podman, and want to know more about how they work. 
If you've never used containers before, this probably isn't the place
to start -- I'd suggest getting familiar with podman as a first step.
