<h1>Solving a quadratic equation in a prime (finite) field</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/antenna.png" 
  alt="antenna icon"/>
A finite field is a bounded set of mathematical entities -- often numbers,
but not exclusively 
 -- that obey fundamental rules of arithmetic.
Of course, ordinary real numbers obey the everyday rules of arithmetic,
and so constitute a field. However, it's easy to do arithmetic on real
numbers because there's such a lot of them. 
The defining feature of a finite field is
that its arithmetic yields results that lie entirely within the limited
set of objects that comprise the field. 
A cornerstone of the manipulation of finite fields
 is the use of modular arithmetic. 
</p>
<p>
Finite fields, sometimes referred to as <i>Galois fields</i>,
are a key feature of coding theory, communications 
theory, and cryptography. 
</p>
<p>
If you've never seen finite fields before, then I have 
<a href="finite_fields.html">an overview article</a>. This present article
only concerns numeric fields, which must by their very nature have
a prime number of elements starting at zero. Such fields are often 
called <i>prime fields</i>, and denoted "GF(n)" where <i>n</i> is the 
number of members of the field.
All arithmetic in GF(5), for example, is 
carried out modulo 5, so the entire set of field members is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.
</p>

<p>
In principle, arithmetic on finite fields is simple -- at least with
small fields -- but there are a number of things
to watch out for.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Although addition and multiplication can be defined in terms
of simple modular arithmetic, division is more complicated. We can't do 
division by applying a regular integer division and then taking the remainder -- we must find a multiplicative inverse (more on this below).</p></li>
<li><p>There are no negative numbers in a prime field -- subtracting a
larger number from a smaller one must yield a positive number.</p></li>
<li><p>Square (and higher) roots don't behave the same as they 
do in regular arithmetic --
for example, a number can have two positive square roots.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
In this article I use as an example solving the solution of a simple 
quadratic equation in
GF(5). Not only does this demonstrate the relevant arithmetic, but
such solutions are frequently necessary in applications of finite fields.
For example, correcting errors in data encoded using a
Reed-Solomon code amounts, in effect, to finding solutions to a polynomial 
equation that indicates the location of the errors in the data block. 
</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>
Suppose we want to solve the following quadratic equation for
<i>r</i>:
</p>

<p align="center"><i>
2 r<sup>2</sup> + r + 4 = 0
</i></p>

<p>
For real numbers, <i>and</i> in a finite field, we can use the traditional
'quadratic formula', that everybody learns by heart in high school:
</p>

<p align="center"><i>
r = [ -b &plusmn; &radic; (b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac) ] / 2a, 
</i></p>

where <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> are the coefficients of the
three terms in the quadratic expression. In my example

<p align="center"><i>
a=2,<br/> 
b=1,<br/>
c=4.
</i></p>

<p>
To use this formula with a finite field, all arithmetic
must be carried out using the rules of that field. 
In GF(5), fundamentally
this means doing all arithmetic modulo 5, and using particular procedures
for division and the taking of square roots.
</p>

<h2>Understanding the arithmetic of GF(5)</h2>

<p>
Let's start by constructing the multiplication table for GF(5). This is
just ordinary integer multiplication, with the result reduced modulo 5.
It helps to write out the whole table (which is, of course, only 
practicable in a small field like GF(5)), because we will use the
table to pick out the inverses and square roots later. Here's the table:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
x | 0 1 2 3 4
---------------
0 | 0 0 0 0 0
1 | 0 1 2 3 4
2 | 0 2 4 1 3
3 | 0 3 1 4 2
4 | 0 4 3 2 1 
</pre>

<p>
To be able to divide, we need the multiplicative inverse of each number
in the field, that is, the number by which can it can  be multiplied to give 1.
We can just pick the row and column corresponding to each 1 in the 
body of the multiplication table. I will use the notation <i>inv(a)</i> to
indicate the multiplicative inverse for <i>a</i>. Here are the relevant
values for GF(5), taken from the multiplication table.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
a | inv(a) 
---------------
0 | - 
1 | 1
2 | 3
3 | 2
4 | 4
</pre>

<p>
Notice that, while 1 is its own inverse in any field, in GF(5) 4 is also
self-inverse.
</p>
<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>For larger fields, there is an algorithmic method for finding inverse called the <i>extended Euclidean method</i>.</blockquote>

<p>
Now let's work out which numbers in GF(5) have square roots -- not all
of them do. Start by constructing a table of squares. These are just
the values on the diagonal of the multiplication table.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
a | sqr(a) 
---------------
0 | 0 
1 | 1
2 | 4
3 | 4
4 | 1
</pre>

<p>
From this squares table, we can see that only 1 and 4 
have non-zero square roots,
and that 4 has two square roots: 2 and 3. So here is the square root
table:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
a | sqrt(a) 
---------------
0 | 0 
1 | 1
4 | 2,3 
</pre>

<p>
There's nothing particularly striking about a number having two square
roots -- after all, real numbers have two square roots. The square
roots of 4 (in real numbers) are &plusmn;2. In GF(5) it's easy to see
that 2<sup>2</sup>=4, but 3<sup>2</sup> is also 4, because
(3 x 3) mod 5 = 4. Note that in modulo-5 arithmetic, 
3 is congruent to -2, which is
another way of understanding why the square of 3 is 4.
Nevertheless, a number's having two positive square roots can seem
a little disconcerting.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, there's nothing striking about a number having <i>no</i> square
root in GF(5). -2, for example, is a member of the real number field,
but has no real-number square root. The operation of square root does not
have to apply to every number in the field in order to be valid. This
does mean that not every conceivable quadration equation in GF(5) has
solutions in GF(5) -- just as <i>X<sup>2</sup> = -1</i> has no solutions
in the real numbers.
</p>


<p>
So now we have all the arithmetic we need, to evaluate the
quadratic formula in GF(5).
</p>

<h2>Evaluating the quadratic formula in GF(5)</h2>

<p>
The denominator of the quadratic formula is <i>2a</i>, which
is 2 x 2 = 4. No adjustment has to be made for GF(5) here.
However, in order to divide by 4 we must multiply by the inverse
of 4. From the table of inverses above we see that the inverse of
4 is 4, so to divide by 4 in GF(5) we must <i>multiply</i> by 4.
</p>
<p>
The quadratic formula also has a <i>-b</i> term, but there are no
negative numbers in GF(5). In this example <i>-b</i> is -1, which
is congruent to 4 in modulo-5 arithmetic (becuse 5 - 1 = 4).
</p>
<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>Some calculators, and some programming languages, treat the modular reduction of a negative number as giving a negative result. While a case can be made for this interpretation, it's unhelpful with finite fields, and a negative result must be shifted to lie in the range of the field.</blockquote>
<p>
So we can re-write the quadratic formula like this:
</p>

<p align="center"><i>
r = [ 4 &plusmn; &radic; (4<sup>2</sup> - 4 x 2 x 4) ] * 4, 
</i></p>

Using the tables above, or just modular arithmetic, we can evalute the
argument of the square root to be

<p align="center"><i>
(4<sup>2</sup> - 4 x 2 x 4) mod 5 = 4.
</i></p>

<p>
4 has a square root in GF(5) -- in fact it has two: 2 and 3. These
different square roots won't give different solutions to the 
quadratic equation. 
Why? 
<i>a + 2</i> is essentially
the same as <i>a - 3</i>, and <i>a + 3</i> the same as <i>a - 2</i> 
(in GF(5)). We don't get additional
solutions here, any more than we get additional solutions in real numbers
from the quadratic formula, by taking the negative square root as well 
as the positive.
</p>
<p>
So we have
</p>

<p align="center"><i>
r = [ 4 &plusmn; 2 ] * 4, 
</i></p>

<p>
Doing this arithmetic modulo 5 we arrive at the two solutions,
<i>r = 3</i> and <i>r = 4</i>.
</p>

<p>
We can check that these two values do, in fact, satisfy the original
quadratic equation, by substituting them into the left-hand side of the 
equation and checking that it evaluates to zero. Of course,
the substituted formula has to be evaluated using GF(5) arithmetic throughout.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
The application of the quadratic formula demonstrates how mathematical
operations originally defined on real numbers can equally be applied
to finite fields. However, when doing the arithmetic manually, care has
to be taken to apply the arithmetic rules of the field rigorously.
