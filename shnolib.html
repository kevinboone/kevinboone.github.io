<h1>C development for Linux without a standard library</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/gears.png"

<h2>Why???</h2>
<p>
This article discusses some of the challenges involved in creating
C applications without the use of a standard C library or, indeed,
any dependencies at all except a Linux kernel.
It's certainly reasonable to ask why you'd want to do such a thing, 
given that there are many substantial and well-maintained
standard C libraries around. I can think of a number of possibilities.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You're working on some highly-optimized embedded platform that
does not, in fact, have a C library available.</p></li>
<li><p>You have some other reason to need to create a program that 
has a tiny memory footprint and sub-millisecond start-up time.</p></li>
<li><p>You want to write a utility that can be distributed in executable
format to any Linux machine of the same architecture. That is, the
executable has no dependencies at all.</p></li>
<li><p>You want to understand how things really work.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
I will illustrate the various roles played by a C standard library
by implementing a <i>very</i> simple Linux shell called <code>shnolib</code>.
There's nothing particularly remarkable, or even interesting about
the program, except that it forces us to think what the standard
library does, and how we can compensate for its absence.  
</p>
<p>
<code>shnolib</code> is not an impressive shell -- it just prompts the
user to enter a line of text, parses it, searches the <code>$PATH</code>
for a matching program, and executes it. It can also execute a file
of commands, line by line, to demonstrate the principles of buffered
input (of which, more below).
</p>
<p>
There is one slightly interesting feature of <code>shnolib</code>, which
can be see by running <code>top -p</code> on it:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
  PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND
 3083 kevin     20   0     184      8      0 S   0.0  0.0   0:00.00 shnolib
</pre>

In case it's not clear, that's 8 <i>kilobytes</i> of mapped physical
memory, in a total address space of 184 kB.   
In this article I'll be making many references to the implementation
of <code>shnolib</code>; 
the source code is available 
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/shnolib">on github</a>.

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>This article primarily describes the AMD64 architecture, although only about 30 lines of assembler code are actually architecture-specific. AMD64 is probably the platform that <i>least</i> needs the techniques described in this article; but it's ubiquitous, making experimentation easy. The source code also includes an assembler module for ARMv7, e.g., Raspberry Pi</blockquote>


<h2>What a standard C library actually does</h2>

<p>
Most C developers don't think much about the standard library; many 
have only a vague notion what it does. It's really only when working
in embedded systems, or non-standard Linux variants like Android, 
that we really have to think about the standard library.
</p>
<p>
If you work with GCC, then there's a 99.9% probability that you're
using the GNU standard library, <code>glibc</code>. This is such a
fundamental part of Linux that it's almost considered part of the
kernel. It's rare to find a desktop or server Linux that does not
have <code>glibc</code> installed, and used by just about every other
piece of software.
</p>
<p>
But <code>glibc</code> isn't the only standard library, even for Linux.
Android doesn't use it by default -- it has its own standard C library
called Bionic. Bionic implements a subset of the functionality of
<code>glibc</code>, but in a way that is appropriate for the
Android platform. A number of embedded Linux system use <a href="https://uclibc-ng.org/" target="_blank">ucLibC</a>, 
which attempts to be much smaller than <code>glibc</code>,
while offering most of the same fundamental features.
</p>
<p>
But what does the standard C library actually do?  
Some or all of the following things, and perhaps others:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>it acts as an entry point for the kernel to start the program, 
setting up a memory
environment suitable for a C program, and providing 
the command-line arguments;</p></li>
<li><p>it provides functions to simplify integration with kernel
system calls (syscalls);</p></li>
<li><p>it allocates and manages memory;</p></li>
<li><p>it provides buffers for I/O to reduce the number of (slow)
kernels calls the application makes;</p></li>
<li><p>it supports a number of programming constructs, like
variable-length argument lists;</p></li>
<li><p>it provides a library of useful functions, for things like
string manipulation, data formatting, error reporting...</p></li>
<li><p>it implements fundamental arithemetic operations that are not
supported by the CPU.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
These are all features that most C programmers -- in fact, most
programmers in any language -- take completely for granted. You 
probably don't realize how much the standard library is doing, until
its gone.
</p>
<p>
The "useful functions" that <code>shnolib</code> requires mostly
centre on manipulating text strings. The program needs a way to
parse a command line, tokenize the <code>$PATH</code>, and construct 
filenames. It needs a way to generate text from
system call error codes. It doesn't really <i>need</i> buffered
input and output, but implementing it is a useful exercise.
</p>
<p>
In the sections that follow, I will demonstrate each of the
standard library functions described above, with reference 
to the <code>shnolib</code>
example. However, before getting into the details,
we need a brief digression about C-language calling conventions.
</p>

<div class="boxedtext">
<h2>A note about calling conventions</h2>

<p>
A 'calling convention' is a specification for passing arguments 
to functions,
and returning values from functions. The developer rarely needs
to worry about this -- the compiler generates the necessary
code. It's really only something we have to face when writing
code that calls C from assembler, or <i>vice versa</i>.
</p>
<p>
There are two main ways in which arguments are passed in C code.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The arguments are pushed onto the stack by the calling function,
usually in reverse order so the first argument is at the top
of the stack. The called function reads them from the stack.</p></li>
<li><p>The arguments are passed from the calling function to the
called function in CPU registers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
These methods are often used in combination. 
Passing arguments in registers is much quicker
than using the stack, but CPUs have a limited set of registers. 
The calling convention needs to define what types of registers
are used for what type of data.
</p>
<p>
For the record, on AMD64 GCC uses the following registers for integer and
pointer data, in this order: RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, and R9. If
the application requires more than six arguments, the remaining arguments
are pushed on the stack. Different registers are used for floating-point
numbers, but that need not concern us here.
</p>
<p>
The return value from a function, if it is an integer or pointer, is
passed in RAX register.
</p>
<p>
Now, here's the complication: the calling convention on AMD64 for
Linux kernel syscalls is <i>almost</i> the same as the GCC calling
convention. But not exactly the same. Specifically, syscalls use
R10 rather than RCX for the fourth argument. In addition, the
kernel requires the specific syscall to be identified by a number
in the EAX register.
We'll see why this is important when we discuss calling kernel
syscalls from C later.
</p>
</div>

<div class="boxedtext">
<h2>A note about assembly language</h2>

<p>
There are a few places in the implementation of the <code>shnolib</code> 
program where
we need assembler code. However, I've
tried to minimize the use of assembly language, to those small parts of the 
example that really need it -- where there's no alternative. Although
it's possible to embed assembly code in C, I prefer to keep these
things separate, so it's clearer what needs to be changed to suit
a different architecture.
</p>
<p>
The assembly language snippets in this article, and in the 
<code>shnolib</code> sample, are in GNU syntax, intended to be
processed with the GNU <code>as</code> assembler.
</p>
</div> 


<h2>Providing an entry point and environment</h2>

<p>
One of the main functions of a standard C library is to start
the main program with a suitable environment.
When building a executable file, which will be in ELF format on Linux,
 we specify the starting address in 
memory for program execution. The GNU linker <code>ld</code> will
set the starting address to a function called <code>_start</code>, which
has to exist. In principle, we could provide the <code>_start</code>
function in C, but it needs to do various things that C can't 
easily do. Most obviously, the library needs to pass the command-line
arguments and environment (<code>$PATH</code>, etc) to the C
program. 
</p>
<p>
In all architectures, the kernel passes the command-line and 
environment on the stack. In compiler set-ups which 
use the stack exclusively for argument passing, we could just call
<code>main()</code> directly from <code>_start</code>. However,
this use of the stack for calling isn't guaranteed in C and, 
in fact, code generated by GCC for
AMD64 uses CPU registers for at least some arguments. So we
need to extract the relevant data from the stack, and put it into
registers before calling <code>main()</code>.
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned before, a C function needs its first argument passed
in the RDI register, and the second in RSI. The function 
<code>main</code> is conventionally defined like this:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#009900">int</font> <b><font color="#000000">main</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#009900">int</font> argc<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#009900">char</font> <font color="#990000">**</font>argv<font color="#990000">)</font>
</pre>

So we need to pass <code>argc</code> in RDI and <code>argv</code>
in RSI. This is easily done using the following snippet of 
assembler:

<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#000080">.global</font></b> _start

_start<font color="#990000">:</font>
    <b><font color="#0000FF">mov</font></b> <font color="#993399">0x0</font><font color="#990000">(%</font>rsp<font color="#990000">),%</font>rdi
    <b><font color="#0000FF">lea</font></b> <font color="#993399">0x8</font><font color="#990000">(%</font>rsp<font color="#990000">),%</font>rsi
    <b><font color="#0000FF">call</font></b> __main
    <font color="#990000">...</font>
</pre>

<p>
What we're doing here is moving the number at the top of the stack
into RDI, and the <code>address</code> of the top of the stack
into RSI. We need the address because the kernel doesn't push
a <code>char**</code> onto the stack -- it pushes the individual
<code>char*</code> values for the command-line arguments.
</p>

<p>
By way of comparison, here is the same code for ARM. If you compare
the two implementations you'll see that, although the registers
are different (ARM uses r0 and r1 for the first two arguments,
and these are 32-bit registers),
and the operand syntax is a little different, the AMD64 and
ARM implementations do exactly the same thing. This is only to be
expected, since the kernel passes the command line and environment
the same way, regardless of architecture.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#000080">.global</font></b> _start

_start<font color="#990000">:</font>
   ldr    <font color="#990000">%</font>r<font color="#993399">0</font><font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#990000">[</font><font color="#009900">sp</font><font color="#990000">]</font>
   <b><font color="#0000FF">add</font></b>    r<font color="#993399">1</font><font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#009900">sp</font><font color="#990000">,</font> #<font color="#993399">4</font>
   <font color="#009900">bl</font>      __main
</pre>

<p>
We could call <code>main()</code> directly from <code>_start</code>
but, in fact, I call a C function called <code>__main()</code>, which
eventually calls <code>main()</code>. <code>__main()</code> carries out
various initialization steps, including initializing the environment.
</p>
<p>
But where is the environment? Well, the kernel just pushes the
environment strings, in the form <code>FOO=bar</code> onto the stack,
directly under the command-line arguments. The <code>__main()</code>
function can find the
location of the environment in memory simply by reading 'off the 
end' of the <code>argv</code> passed by the assembler code. 
We don't need the environment at start-up time, but we'll need it
whenever the program needs an environment variable. 
The <code>shnolib</code> program uses the environment variables
<code>HOME</code> and <code>PATH</code>.
</p>
<p>
My <code>__main()</code> method also sets up buffers for buffered
I/O. This would be a good place to initialize the memory management
system, if it were complicated enough to need initialization
-- mine isn't.
</p>

<h2>Handing syscalls</h2>

<p>
Let's first consider the kinds of things that a C program will 
need to ask the kernel to do.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>File and device I/O</p></li>
<li><p>Getting file information (size, access modes).</p></li>
<li><p>Allocating memory</p></li>
<li><p>Process control
(<code>fork</code>/<code>exec</code>/<code>wait</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Changing the program environment -- permissions, working
directory, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Networking.</p></li>
<li><p>Getting information and user identity.</p></li>
<li><p>Signal handling.</p></li>
<li><p>Sharing memory and other forms of IPC.</p></li>
<li><p>Yielding the CPU and scheduling work.</p></li>
<li><p>...and many others.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These functions are all provided by <i>syscalls</i> -- numbered
entry points to the kernel</p>
<p>
We'll see that some syscalls are very rudimentary, compared
to the sophistication that a C programmer would expect from a 
standard library. There's no <code>malloc()</code>
in the kernel, for example -- programs are expected to manage their own address
space. 
</p>
<p>
A C function like <code>write()</code>, however, is actually a fairly thin
wrapper around a kernel call, <code>sys_write</code>. 
In C, <code>write()</code> is usually 
defined like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#009900">int</font> <b><font color="#000000">write</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#009900">int</font> fd<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#009900">void</font> <font color="#990000">*</font>buffer<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#008080">size_t</font> size<font color="#990000">);</font> 
</pre>

<p>
This is, it takes two integer and one pointer argument. These arguments
will all need to be passed to the kernel in registers, as described
above. 
</p>
<p>
The Linux kernel is so closely bound to the C programming language
that you'll find that the kernel parameters are a more-or-less exact
match for the corresponding C functions in the standard library, for most of 
the syscalls that have C wrappers.
That is, the kernel takes its arguments in the same order as 
the corresponding C function in the standard library.
This means that we can implement a general <code>syscall()</code> method
that calls an abitrary syscall. However, syscalls usually return
an error code in the EAX register, while C functions usuall set
<code>errno</code>, to indicate success or failure. So there needs to
be a little low-level data manipulation.
</p>
<p>
Let's assume for now that we had a C function that could call an arbitrary
syscall. If we had that, we could write the <code>write()</code>
function like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#009900">int</font> <b><font color="#000000">write</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#009900">int</font> fd<font color="#990000">,</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">const</font></b> <font color="#009900">void</font> <font color="#990000">*</font>buff<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#009900">int</font> l<font color="#990000">)</font>
  <font color="#FF0000">{</font>
  <font color="#009900">int</font> r <font color="#990000">=</font> <b><font color="#000000">syscall</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>SYS_WRITE<font color="#990000">,</font> fd<font color="#990000">,</font> buff<font color="#990000">,</font> l<font color="#990000">);</font>
  <b><font color="#0000FF">if</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>r <font color="#990000">&lt;</font> <font color="#993399">0</font><font color="#990000">)</font>
    <font color="#FF0000">{</font>
    errno <font color="#990000">=</font> <font color="#990000">-</font>r<font color="#990000">;</font>
    <b><font color="#0000FF">return</font></b> <font color="#990000">-</font><font color="#993399">1</font><font color="#990000">;</font>
    <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
  <b><font color="#0000FF">else</font></b>
    <font color="#FF0000">{</font>
    errno <font color="#990000">=</font> <font color="#993399">0</font><font color="#990000">;</font>
    <b><font color="#0000FF">return</font></b> r<font color="#990000">;</font>
    <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
  <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
</pre>

<p>
<code>SYS_WRITE</code> is the numeric code for the syscall. This number
will not necessarily be the same for different Linux architectures --
in fact, it's not even the same for x86 and AMD64 systems. The syscalls
are documented in various places, most obviously in the kernel source.
For the record, on AMD64, <code>SYS_WRITE</code> is syscall "1". 
</p>

<p>
This is all very well, but we don't have a <code>syscall()</code>
function. This is something that really needs to be implemented
in assembly, because its entire purpose is to juggle register
values around. Here is the implementation from <code>shnolib</code>. 
There's nothing
clever about it: it just aligns the kernel register order with the
C register order. On some architectures, or with compilers which use
the stack more for argument passing, this code would need to manipulate
the stack rather than registers.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#000080">.global</font></b> _syscall

<b><font color="#000080">syscall:</font></b>
    <b><font color="#0000FF">mov</font></b> <font color="#990000">%</font>rdi<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#990000">%</font>rax

    syscall
    <b><font color="#0000FF">ret</font></b>
</pre>

<p>
Of the 200-or-so syscalls that are currently defined for the Linux 
kernel, my simple shell needs ten of them.
</p>
<p>
It's worth bearing mind that syscalls are inherently slow to execute,
compared to application code. It's always worth thinking about whether
multiple operations can be aggregated into a single syscall.
</p>

<div class="boxedtext">
<h2>To follow C standard library conventions, or not?</h2>

<p>
Suppose your program needs a way to copy a null-terminated
character string from one place in memory to another. 
Standard libraries provide a function <code>strcpy</code>
for this. If you're implementing this function yourself, without
a library, then you can use any function name you like, taking
whatever arguments you like. You could even choose to implement
text strings as something other than null-terminated character
arrays. A good case can be made, for example, for implementing
strings so that the first few bytes of the string encode 
the string's length. A lot of nasty buffer-overrun attacks could have
been prevented if the C language designers had worked this way
from the start. 
</p>
<p>
You could even choose to implement strings using multi-byte characters
from the very start, as the designers of Java did.
</p>
<p>
My preference, though, is to follow the names and function prototypes of
C standard libraries, when I'm writing code to provide comparable
functionality. Not only does this make the code easier for other people
to follow, but it makes the code more portable -- in both directions.
To an experienced C developer, it's fairly obvious what a function
called <code>atoi</code> (for example) does, and it would be 
confusing if a function with that name did something unexpected.
</p>
<p>
There's a particular wrinkle with strings in particular -- however you
choose to represent text strings in your program, the Linux kernel
expects null-terminated byte arrays for filenames.
</p>

</div>

<h2>Memory management</h2>

<p>
C developers rarely think about how complex the task of memory management
is, and how little help the kernel provides. It's not obvious, but
a C library call like <code>malloc()</code> is not provided by the
kernel -- not in an efficient way. It's possible to use the kernel's
<code>sys_mmap</code> function to map pages of memory to the application's
address space, but this is hopelessly inefficient for small, frequently memory
allocations.
</p>
<p>
The basic facility provided by the kernel for managing memory
is the <code>sys_brk</code> syscall, which gets or sets the end of the 
program's data segment. 
Increasing the size of the data segment effectively allocates memory
to the program; reducing the size frees memory. 
</p>
<p>
The argument to <code>sys_brk</code> is
an address in virtual memory, <i>not</i> a size. If the argument is
zero, the existing address of the end of the data segment is returned,
otherwise the address is set. Conventionally the C standard library wraps
the syscall in a function called <code>brk()</code>, and I have
followed that convention in my sample program.
</p>
<p>
It's important to understand that the kernel cannot be forced to
set the end of the data segment to a specific address, even
if the memory is available -- the kernel
will typically allocate memory in pages of a fixed size. Provided that
enough memory is available, the <code>sys_brk</code> syscall will
set the data segment to <i>at least</i> the requested address, but it
might be higher. The return value from <code>sys_brk</code> is the
address actually allocated.
</p>
<p>
In order to allocate memory using 
the <code>sys_brk</code> syscall,
we need to know where the <i>start</i> of the data segment is,
so we can determine where the end should be (at least approximately,
as discussed above).
Conventionally the data segment starts after the storage allocated
to static variables and constants. 
For example, if
we define <code>static int x;</code>, the compiler can reserve
space for <code>x</code> even though its value is not known at
compile time (it will be initialized to a default value, however).
The C compiler defines a static variable called <code>end</code>
whose location is just past the end of the allocated data 
area. So, peculiar as it may sound, the address <code>&amp;end</code>
is the <i>start</i> of the data segment. If we know the start of the
data segment, we can always calculate the required end by adding
the amount of memory required to the start address.
</p>
<p>
However, in most cases we don't actually care where the specific
end of the data segment is -- we just want to move it up or down
by particular amounts, according to the programs's memory demands.
The C standard library has a function called <code>sbrk</code> that
expands the data segment by a specified number of bytes. In practice,
C developers don't use <code>brk</code> or <code>sys_brk</code> but,
of the two, <code>sbrk</code> is more useful. If we have a function
<code>brk()</code> then we can implement <code>sbrk</code> like this:
</p>

  <i><font color="#9A1900">//...</font></i>
  <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
</pre>

<p>
The ugly casts are necessary because the kernel does not distinguish
between an integer value and a pointer, but the C compiler does. 
I should point out that types like <code>inptr_t</code> are defined
in the header files of the standard library, and will depend on the
architecture's pointer size. Without a standard library we have to
make those definitions ourselves, but using the conventional type
names allows us to keep track of what changes need to be made to
suit different architectures. GCC provides a pre-defined
macro <code>__WORDSIZE</code> to help with this. 
</p>
<p>
So, in summary, we can use the <code>sys_brk</code> syscall to
expand, and perhaps contract, the amount of memory allocated to
the program.
</p>
<p>
This is all very well if the program just manipulates one huge block
of memory, that all functions share. In practice, this isn't very 
convenient -- we need functions equivalent to <code>malloc()</code>
and <code>free()</code> for doing fine-grained memory management.
</p>
<p>
<code>shnolib</code> uses a very crude memory allocation strategy,
which I wouldn't recommend for any serious application -- but it does work.
This is how <code>malloc()</code> and <code>free()</code> work.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The program maintains a linked list of memory blocks. Each
block starts with a size and pointer to the next block, if there
is one.</p></li>
<li><p>When the program calls <code>malloc()</code>, the
function searches the linked list for a free block of at least the
requested size. If there is one, then the address of the block is
returned, and the block is marked as in use.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is no free block, the program calls its implementation
of <code>sbrk()</code> to expand the data segment. The expansion must
be large enough to include the block header, as well as the data
itself.</p></li>
<li><p>When the program calls <code>free()</code>, the memory block
is marked as free, and can be used again later.</p></li>
<li><p>The data segment never gets any smaller.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
The implementation is inefficient for a whole host of reasons. Most
obviously, it makes no attempt to match the sizes of memory requests
to the sizes of available blocks -- memory can easily become fragmented.
Still, it does work well enough to demonstrate the principle. 
</p>
<p>
A number of highly efficient memory allocators have been developed over
the years, some in C and some in assembler. The only possible defence
for my crude implementation is that it requires only about 400 bytes
of code.
</p>

<h2>Buffered I/O</h2>
<p>
The C standard library uses buffered I/O to implement functions like
<code>fprintf()</code> and <code>fgets()</code>. These functions all take
a <code>FILE *</code> as an argument; the <code>FILE</code> structure
maintains memory and indexes for buffering data.
</p>
<p>
But why do we need this additional complexity? The reason, which I've
already alluded to, is that there are significant overheads involved
in making kernel calls. If you need to read or write a large file, it's
hugely more efficient to do it in large blocks, than in many small
I/O operations. 
</p>
<p>
If we do buffer I/O, then we need a mechanism to flush the buffers 
at specific points, and when the file or stream is closed. This flushing
can be done automatically (when and end-of-line is read, for example), or
we can provide specific functions for it. The functions of the C standard
library provide both methods.
</p>
<p>
There's nothing particularly interesting about implementing buffered I/O
-- it's just a case of hacking code to manipulate the buffers. There are
some subtleties involved in making a really optimal implementation, as
there always are. <code>shnolib</code> uses its own implementation of
<code>fputs()</code> and <code>fgets()</code> for writing and reading
the console. This isn't really necessary, since a shell -- even a 
crude one -- really only works at the user's speed. However, it's an
interesting exercise to implement these functions.
</p>


<h2>Variable-length argument lists</h2>

<p>
It's idiomatic in C programming to define functions that take a
variable number of arguments. Everybody is familiar with
<code>printf()</code>, for example. Usually the called function determines
how many arguments were passed in one of two ways. It might use the 
first argument to determine what the others are (as <code>printf</code> 
does) or it might use some special value, usually <code>NULL</code>,
as an indication where the arguments stop. This is what
<code>execl</code> does. These techniques are necessary
because C calling conventions do not stipulate that the caller
must indicate explicitly how many arguments have been passed -- the called
function has to work it out from the context.
</p>
<p>
Developers do not usually have to worry about the mechanics of handling
variable-length argument lists -- the standard library provides
macros that do all the work. It's easy, therefore, to forget how
difficult the process actually is. In the old days, when argument
passing was invariably by the stack, it was relatively straightforward
-- if the called function wanted to read the n'th argument, it would
look n places down the stack. We knew where the top of the stack
was, because the first argument passed to the function -- which is
always named explicitly -- is on the top of the stack. So if
we read 'off the end' of the first argument, we get the other arguments.
This was straightforward whether it was done by the C developer,
as it was back in the day, or by features in the standard library.
</p>
<p>
These days we don't normally use the stack for passing arguments,
not alone, at least. Modern compilers typically use some mixture
of stack-based and register-based argument passing. It's no longer
possible to find the arguments just by reading off the end of the
first argument. In AMD64 the first argument is not even in 
memory -- it's in the RDI register.
</p>
<p>
When we use macros like <code>va_start</code> to read variable-length
argument lists, the implementation is provided by the standard C
library. The implementation is complicated, architecture-specific,
and at least partly in assembly language. So there needs to be a
different implementation for each architecture.
In fact, I can't think of any way of handling variable-length arguments,
however ugly, that isn't architecture-specific. 
</p>
<p>
It's undeniably useful to implement functions
that provide functionality like 
<code>printf</code> and <code>fprintf</code>. However, adding the 
code needed to support this kind of operation would have doubled
the size of the <code>shnolib</code> program, and made it even
less portable that it already is. When working without a standard
library, I've learned to work around the lack of variable-length
argument support, rather than implementing it myself.
</p>

<h2>Arithmetic</h2>
<p>
CPUs differ in their built-in support for arithemetic. Most 
CPUs have limited support for floating-point math, but even
integer arithemetic is not guaranteed to be supported. 64-bit x86
CPUs have a full set of integer math (add, subtract, multiply, divide,
modulus) for variable sizes up to 64 bits. Since <code>gcc</code>
generally takes a <code>long</code> to be 64 bits, on any architecture,
that means that the compiler will generate instructions that work
on <code>int</code> and <code>long</code> variables.
</p>
<p>
The 32-bit ARMv7, in contrast, has 64-bit addition, subtraction,
and multiplication
support, but no such support for division or modulus. So, while
the compiler will take care of some arithmetic operations, for 
others it will output a function call. Thus, for example, 
some forms of division result in the generation of a call to
<code>__aeabi_idiv</code>.
</p>
<p>
If you're working without a standard library, you'll need to provide
implementations of these functions, or reorganize your code
so they aren't necessary. It's not difficult, in principle,
to implement division and modulus using subtraction, but it's
difficult to do well. <code>shnolib</code> only uses these 
operations for converting error codes to ASCII, and my implementations
do not bear close scrutiny.
</p>


<h2>Compilation issues</h2>
<p>
Back in the day, C compilers were completely independent of the 
standard C library. That clean separate between what the compiler does,
and what the standard library does, is an enduring benefit for those
of us who have to work without libraries and dependencies.
</p>
<p>
More recently, the line between compiler and library has become eroded
in the GCC compiler. For example, if you use a function like 
<code>open()</code>, the compiler will warn you to <code>#include</code>
the relevant header if you forget. It will also warn you if you aren't
using the arguments to <code>printf</code> correctly.
</p>
<p>
While useful for routine programming, all this sophistication just gets
in the way when working on embedded systems. You can disable a lot
of it using the <code>-fno-builtin</code> switch to <code>gcc</code>.
</p>
<p>
If you looked at the source for <code>shnolib</code> you'll see that
I created a single source file and a single header file for all 
my general-purpose functions. You could, in principle, use the same
source and header for multiple projects that required the same 
functionality. However, in applications like this storage is likely to
be critical, and we wouldn't want to include function definitions that
aren't actually used. 
</p>
<p>
The solution here is to compile the code using 
the <code>-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections</code> switches. This
forces <code>gcc</code> to output a separate section in the object file
for each definition. While this is slightly wasteful by itself, you
can then specify <code>--gc-sections</code> to the linker. The linker
will remove entire sections that have no references to them.
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
There are very few reasons these days, other than when working on embedded
systems, to write C code without using a standard library. Libraries
like <code>glibc</code> are well-maintained, efficient, and relatively
compact for the amount of functionality they provide. However, learning
how to work without a standard library provides useful insights into 
the operation of the platform, and is worth attempting, even if only
for educational purposes.
