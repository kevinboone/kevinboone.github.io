Like many aspects of English, capitalization has few rules that are set in stone; but there are some conventions that serious writers ought to keep in mind.</p><p style="font-size: smaller">Categories: <a href="education-groupindex.html">education</a></p>

However, it's sometimes difficult, or unhelpful, to draw diagrams to scale. This article tries to explain the difference between benign and pernicious distortions of scale. I'm picking on the flat-earthers for the purposes of illustration, but the presentational devices they use are common in business and politics as well.</p><p style="font-size: smaller">Categories: <a href="science_and_technology-groupindex.html">science and technology</a>, <a href="education-groupindex.html">education</a>, <a href="snake_oil-groupindex.html">snake oil</a></p>

I've updated this article slightly since I wrote it thirty years ago, to deal with the rise in web-based publication.
