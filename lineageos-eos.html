<h1 id="lineage-os-vs-eos-in-2025">Lineage OS vs /e/OS in 2025</h1>
<p><img src="img/lineage_logo.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>I’m pleased to say that I’ve been living Google-free for two years
now, for reasons I explained in <a href="degoogle.html">an earlier
article</a>. Part of the de-Googling process has been to install
alternative operating systems on my cellphones and tablets, of which I
have far too many. At the time I filed for divorce from Google, I found
the most popular of these alternatives (probably) to be Lineage OS.
Lineage is still going strong, albeit quietly: Lineage 23, based on
Android 16, was released a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>I’ve had a slight niggle of concern, over the last couple of years,
that Lineage <a href="lineageos-degoogled.html">might not be as
thoroughly degoogled as we might hope</a>. There are known problems with
the ‘captive portal’ test, the use of Google’s DNS servers as a
fallback, seeding GPS with Google-derived positioning data, and the
‘WebView’ implementation. WebView is a component that provides a minimal
web browser for applications and services that need one, distinct from
any full browser you might have installed. Lineage OS uses Chromium for
its WebView support, which might still have some Google connections.</p>
<p>/e/OS is a derivative of Lineage which, I’m pleased to say, addresses
all these concerns. So I thought it would be interesting to try /e/OS on
a couple of my devices, and report on the similarities and differences
between it, and regular Lineage OS.</p>
<h2 id="why-eos-is-better-than-lineage">Why /e/OS is better than
Lineage</h2>
<p>For privacy advocates it is, of course, significant that /e/OS
addresses known privacy limitations in Lineage. For example, it’s
WebView implementation is based on a fork of Chromium that has all the
Google connections scrubbed. As I said in my earlier article, however,
the privacy problems with Lineage are not huge, compared to those that
plague a regular Android full of vendor bloat and Google spyware. These
issues should be taken seriously, but they’re probably not a reason for
panic unless your privacy requirements are painfully stringent.</p>
<p>For privacy enthusiasts who <em>aren’t</em> technology Geeks, a huge
advantage of /e/OS is that it’s relatively straightforward to buy a
smartphone which has it pre-installed. Such devices are available from
Murena, a small company which I’ll have more to say about later. Murena
sells both new and reconditioned /e/OS phones and, although they aren’t
the latest models, they’re good enough for most purposes. Prices start
about about £300.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s possible to buy handsets with GrapheneOS, Lineage
<em>et al.</em>, from private sellers on auction sites and the like. The
problem with buying this way, of course, is the total absence of any
kind of after-sales support.</p>
<p>Buying an /e/OS phone from Murena is much more expensive that buying
the same model from, say, BackMarket and installing the software
yourself. For example, Murena sells a refurbished Pixel 8 for £516.
Right now, I can buy the same handset model from BackMarket for £268.
That’s not a criticism: Murena is providing a service, and is entitled
to charge for it. Still, if you <em>can</em> do the installation
yourself, it’s clearly a cost-saver, regardless which platform you’re
installing.</p>
<p>If you’re willing to do the installation yourself, you’ll find that
installing /e/OS is very similar to installing Lineage: horrible. That’s
not the fault of either platform; installing any custom firmware is a
ghastly process. The written instructions are similar in both cases,
too, and both are confusing in similar areas. If you’re familiar with
installing one of these platforms, you won’t be surprised by the other.
In fact, the Lineage custom recovery software will install /e/OS, even a
version that is significantly more up-to-date (I checked, but only on
one handset).</p>
<p>Because /e/OS lags Lineage a little, /e/OS still provides binaries
for handsets that Lineage no longer supports. I tried to get a Lineage
installer for my Samsung Note 9, and was annoyed to find it had
disappeared from the Lineage download site. There’s still an installer
for /e/OS, though.</p>
<p>Unlike Lineage, /e/OS offers a complete infrastructure, with support
for e-mail, calendars, shared file storage, and all the usual stuff that
Google offers. This is probably the most important difference between
the platforms. /e/OS includes apps compatible with this infrastructure,
and I can see how this might be an advantage – perhaps a decisive one –
for the non-Geeks, just as Google’s infrastructure is. Unlike Google,
however, the provider of the infrastructure – essentially Murena again –
is making firm privacy commitments, which have been subjected to some
measure of external audit.</p>
<p>/e/OS includes a bunch of integrated privacy tools, with a
nice-looking dashboard that reports how many threats you have
(apparently) been protected from. How all this works is not
well-documented. Rather oddly, in my view, /e/OS has built-in support
for Tor network operations. The use of Tor hides the handset’s network
identify as a VPN does, but in a decentralized way. At present, however,
I’m not sure that Tor is well-provisioned enough for routine use, and
the /e/OS maintainers are quite open about how enabling it will probably
degrade Internet throughput.</p>
<p>Another interesting inclusion is a parental control system, providing
regulation over which apps can be used at which times, for how long.
This feature can be retro-fitted to other Android installations, but I
can see how having it available from the start will suit many handset
purchasers.</p>
<p>/e/OS includes MicroG by default. That’s going to be convenient for
many users, but creates its own concerns: more on this later.</p>
<h2 id="why-lineage-is-better-than-eos">Why Lineage is better than
/e/OS</h2>
<p>Most obviously, Lineage is a little more up-to-date than /e/OS, and
this likely means better availability of security patches. Because /e/OS
is derived from Lineage, it’s always going to lag a little. At present,
/e/OS supports Android 15 on some devices, while Lineage provides
Android 16.</p>
<p>Lineage is <em>just</em> an operating system: it doesn’t provide
anything but the bare minimum of apps. As a Lineage user, you probably
have your own favourites, anyway. I was disagreeably surprised to find
that the /e/OS built-in e-mail client didn’t auto-detect the settings of
my mail provider (FastMail). It worked fine when I entered the settings
manually, but I didn’t have to do that with, for example, K-9. More
annoyingly, the built-in apps in /e/OS are hard to remove if you’d
prefer to use something else. Even after rooting the handset, in fact,
they were hard to remove.</p>
<p>And some of the /e/OS built-in app choices are, frankly,
questionable. There’s the Magic Earth navigation app, for example. I
image that the /e/OS folks feel they have to provide a mapping services,
since Google does, and there aren’t many viable alternatives. Magic
Earth is a perfectly serviceable app, with perfectly serviceable mapping
behind it. But it’s a subscription service and, worse, one that the user
can only pay for using Google or Apple infrastructure. This makes its
claim of being privacy-centred pretty hard to uphold, in my view. To be
fair, the Magic Earth maintainers are well aware of this problem, and
say they’re investigating alternative payment mechanisms for de-Googled
handsets. When, or whether, this will happen is unclear at present.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the difficulty of removing the built-in apps, Android
being what it is, it’s easy enough to install the apps you like, on both
platforms.</p>
<p>Lineage doesn’t include MicroG, although you can install it manually,
following a well-documented process. I prefer to have a minimal
installation that I can add to, rather than have the platform provider
make decisions for me; but, again, I’m aware that /e/OS is focusing on a
more mainstream user base.</p>
<h2 id="murena">Murena</h2>
<p>/e/OS is managed by something called the “e.foundation”, a non-profit
organization which has close ties to the commercial Murena, a small
company headquartered in Paris. At the time of writing it had about 40
employees, and seven major investors. Some of these investors appear to
be state-controlled – I’ll leave you to make your own minds up about
whether that’s a good thing or not.</p>
<p>Murena provides the infrastructure for /e/OS services like Calendar
and e-mail, through its <em>Murena Workspace</em> service. After
installation, you’re invited to register for a free Murena account. The
free account is subject to stringent limitations, which are not
well-documented. For example, free accounts are limited to sending about
2 e-mails per hour. This means that it’s impractical to send e-mails to
multiple recipients, something that has been the subject of heated
exchanges on the /e/ forum. There’s also a total storage limit of
1Gb.</p>
<p>To be fair, a <em>paid</em> subscription for Murena Workspace isn’t
expensive, starting at about £2 per month. This compares favourably with
what I pay for FastMail’s service, but FastMail has some features that I
think are worth paying extra for. YMMV, of course.</p>
<p>To its credit, the /e/OS maintainers aren’t making a secret of their
association with Murena. On the /e/OS FAQ page it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do I need a Murena account with this phone?</p>
<p>It is optional, although we do highly recommend it. You can sign up
for your free Murena account here. A Murena account is an extension of
/e/OS…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I prefer to choose supporting services myself, but the huge uptake of
Google’s services does highlight how much cellphone users value
convenience over privacy. Frankly, I have no way of judging accurately
Murena’s commitment to privacy compared to Google’s, but Murena does at
least <em>have</em> one. Google is perfectly open about how it will
monetize your personal data. On balance, therefore, I find Murena’s
approach a more palatable one.</p>
<p>I’m not sure that Murena has the resources, right now, to support
widespread adoption of its services. But we all have to start
somewhere.</p>
<h2 id="microg">MicroG</h2>
<p>MicroG is an open-source, privacy-sparing implementation of part of
the ‘Google Play Services’ infrastructure that bedevils Android. It’s no
secret that Google Play Services is a data siphon, but many apps won’t
work without it. Including MicroG in e/OS/ certainly improves
compatibility with mainstream Android apps, and /e/OS includes its own
interface to Google’s app store.</p>
<p>Unless you add MicroG to Lineage OS, you’re more-or-less limited to
running apps that are available from alternative sources like F-Droid.
Or, of course, getting hold of <code>.apk</code> files from whichever
sources you’re willing to trust. Not everybody regards this as a bad
thing.</p>
<p>MicroG is divisive in the de-Googling community. There’s no question
that it makes a de-Googled smartphone easier to use, but it has its own
privacy concerns. Moreover, many people – including me – feel we should
be developing alternatives to Google, not spoofing it.</p>
<h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h2>
<p>/e/OS tidies up some relatively minor privacy holes in Lineage OS,
and this is to be welcomed. In all other respects, /e/OS wins over
Lineage to exactly the extent that you want a fully-integrated
smartphone ecosystem that isn’t Google or Apple. Ideally, we should
<em>all</em> want that but, right now, I have to question whether Murena
Workspace is the best way to get it.</p>
<p>A number of other businesses now provide these services: FastMail,
Proton, tuta, Posteo… All have different features, security policies,
and pricing models. I see nothing wrong – and a lot to be welcomed – in
Murena’s offering, and I’m sure it will suit some people. My slight
concern is the rather cosy relationship between /e/OS and Murena, and
the lack of personal choice it could promote.</p>
<p>I have to admit that, if I were embarking on my de-Googling journey
today, /e/OS with Murena Workspace would be an appealing prospect. If I
had adopted this approach, I’m not sure I would have investigated any
alternatives, some of which might have turned out to suit me better.</p>
<p>At the same time, I can’t deny I’m a nerd, and most other people are
not. Anybody who’s trying to provide a Google-free, privacy-sparing
smartphone ecosystem for those other people deserves our respect.</p>
