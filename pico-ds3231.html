<h1>Using the Maxim DS3231 I2C real-time clock in C on the Raspberry Pi Pico</h1>

<p>

</p>
<p>
The Maxim DS3231 I2C real-time clock is a reasonably accurate, inexpensive
device, that is easy to interface to the Raspberry Pi Pico. In fact, because
its I2C protocol is so straightforward, it can almost be used as an object
lesson in I2C programming on the Pico. This article is about programming
the device in C; Python support is available elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
I'm only giving snippets of C source code in this article; full source code
is in
<a target="_blank" 
  href="https://github.com/kevinboone/pico-ds3213">my GitHub repository</a>.
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>In order to reduce complexity, this article only deals with the basic date, time, and temperature features of the DS3231. The device also supports alarms, and has sophisticated calibration procedures which I only touch on.</blockquote>

<h2>About the DS3231</h2>
<p>
The DS3231 is a battery-backed real-time clock with an I2C interface. 
Typically the battery is a 3V CR2032 cell, but the device has a power
supply range of 2.3 to 5.5 volts. Power will be taken from whichever
supply -- the battery or external power -- has the
higher voltage. So if the IC is powered from the Pico's 3.3V output, the
battery voltage must be lower than that. 
</p>
<p>
The IC itself is only available in surface-mount format,
but modules with ordinary solder pins are available from on-line sellers
for a few pounds. Some modules include a battery holder for a specific
type of cell. Some also include a low-capacity flash memory device; if
provided, this will probably use a different I2C interface to that
of the clock.
</p>
<p>
The I2C address of the DS3231 is 0x68, and this cannot be changed.
</p>
The DS3231 has nineteen registers -- seven for the time and date,
nine for setting alarms, two for temperature, and one control
register. Although it can be configured to operate in different modes,
the default operation will generally be fine when connected to a 
microcontroller.  
</p>
<p>
As well as date and time, the DS3231 exposes a temperature measurement.
It measures the temperature for calibrating its internal oscillator, 
rather for general applications, and the temperature of the IC is
likely to be at least a little higher than ambient.
</p>

<h2>Setting up the I2C</h2>
<p>
As with any I2C device, we need to set up the relevant GPIO pins. 
There are only two -- data (SDA) and clock (SCL).

</pre>

<p>
The baud rate of 100000 is a safe value to use, but the device may run
faster with tidy wiring and a stable power supply.
Note that I2C is an open-collector system, that is, signalling is performed
by connecting the data and clock lines to ground, rather than applying
actual voltages. This means that the data and clock pins need to be
"pulled up" somewhere with a resistor. The I2C device does not have
pull-up resistors of its own, but pull-ups can be applied in the Pico.
</p>

<h2>The DS3231 registers</h2>
<p>
Using the DS3231 amounts to reading and writing its registers. For basic
date and time operation we only need the first seven, R0-R6. To
read the temperature we need registers R17 and R18. 
</p>
Registers can be read and written individually or in bulk. In general,
data is read or written until the controller sends an I2C stop.
</p>
<p>
To read a single register, we write the address without a stop, and then
read the value, with a stop. So the code looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#008080">uint8_t</font> reg<font color="#990000">=&lt;</font>reg_num<font color="#990000">&gt;;</font>
<font color="#008080">uint8_t</font> result<font color="#990000">;</font>
<b><font color="#000000">i2c_write_blocking</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>I2C_PORT<font color="#990000">,</font> DS3231_ADDRESS<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#990000">&amp;</font>reg<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#993399">1</font><font color="#990000">,</font>  true<font color="#990000">);</font>
<b><font color="#000000">i2c_read_blocking</font></b>  <font color="#990000">(</font>I2C_PORT<font color="#990000">,</font> DS3231_ADDRESS<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#990000">&amp;</font>result<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#993399">1</font><font color="#990000">,</font> false<font color="#990000">);</font>
</pre>

<p>
To write a single register, we send the register number and the byte
of data, with a stop at the end:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#008080">uint8_t</font> b<font color="#990000">[</font><font color="#993399">2</font><font color="#990000">]</font> <font color="#990000">=</font> <font color="#FF0000">{</font><font color="#990000">&lt;</font>reg_num<font color="#990000">&gt;,</font> <font color="#990000">&lt;</font>value<font color="#990000">&gt;</font><font color="#FF0000">}</font><font color="#990000">;</font>
<b><font color="#000000">i2c_write_blocking</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>I2C_PORT<font color="#990000">,</font> DS3231_ADDRESS<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#990000">&amp;</font>b<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#993399">2</font><font color="#990000">,</font>  false<font color="#990000">);</font>
</pre>

<p>
To read a group of registers, we send the register number without a stop,
and then read as many bytes as required. To read all the time and
date registers (R0 to R6), however, there's no need even to 
send an address, because 0 is assumed:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#008080">uint8_t</font> values<font color="#990000">[</font><font color="#993399">7</font><font color="#990000">];</font>
<b><font color="#000000">i2c_read_blocking</font></b>  <font color="#990000">(</font>I2C_PORT<font color="#990000">,</font> DS3231_ADDRESS<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#990000">&amp;</font>values<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#993399">7</font><font color="#990000">,</font> false<font color="#990000">);</font>
</pre>

<p>
Some of the date-time registers contain additional data, which the
controller needs to deal with. For example, bit 6 of register 2, which
contains the "hour" value, indicates whether the clock is in 24-hour or
12-hour timing mode. This bit needs to be filtered out of the hours value.
</p>

<h2>Register data format</h2>
<p>
All the date/time register values are in binary-coded decimal. That is, each
byte is treated as two four-bit groups, each containing a decimal
number. This is inefficient -- The FAT32 filesystem, for example,
squeezes an entire date/time into four bytes, while the 
DS3231 requires seven bytes with its BCD format. The use of BCD makes
decoding for display purposes very easy, but it's not a natural format
for computation. Happily, conversion from ordinary binary to BCD is
simple and fast, even on a microcontroller. 
</p>

<p>
The format of the temperature register is a little different. R17
stores the integer part of the temperature in Celsius, whilst
the top two bits of R18 store a number between 0 and 3. This number
represents a number of quarter-degree steps. So the overall temperature
is given by
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
 R18 + R19 * 0.25
</pre>

<h2>Date/time register values</h2>
<p>
The first seven registers, R0-R6, hold the year, month, day,
day-of-week, hour, minute, and second values. Note that the 
year is a two-digit BCD number, so we have to make an assumption about
the century. This is not problematic at present, and won't be until
2099. This makes interpretation of the registers easy -- for the year
2022 we just store "22". 
</p>
<p>
It's a bit of an oddity that the DS3231 has separate 'day' (of month)
and day-of-week registers. However, because the year is only a two-digit
value, in principle the same day-of-month can be associated with different
days-of-week (in different centuries). In addition, when the IC is used
in simple clock designs, it makes design a lot easier if the IC can supply
a day-of-week value without calculation.
</p>
<p>
In a microcontroller application, it does no harm if the day-of-week
register is ignored completely, and neither read nor written.
</p>

<h2>Calibration and crystal ageing</h2>
<p>
I won't dwell on these points in this introductory article, but designers
should be aware that the DS3231 can be calibrated. This is done by
switching different capacitors in parallel with the crystal. It's expected
that, as the crystal ages, its oscillation frequency will drift a little.
If the application is required to keep to-the-second precision over 
months, it will need to be calibrated by adjusting the oscillator
frequency. 
</p>

<h2>Sample source code</h2>
<p>
So that's it -- DS3231 interfacing is pretty straightforward. However,
it's somewhat difficult to explain in the absract. A complete application
example is available in
<a target="_blank" 
  href="https://github.com/kevinboone/pico-ds3213">my GitHub repository</a>.
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
Reading the date/time repeatedly from the I2C clock IC is inefficient, both
in I2C bandwidth and CPU usage. If the date/time is only read once every
few seconds, that's probably not a problem. However, if it's done
hundreds of times a second, that's a different matter. Each read will
take a few milliseconds.
</p>
<p>
A better approach, perhaps, is to synchronize the I2C real-time clock
to some internal, system clock when the Pico starts up. Thereafter,
the application might resynchronize at intervals of, say, an hour.
The Pico has a built in clock whose data format is oddly similar
to that of the DS3231.
