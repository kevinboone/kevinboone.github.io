<h1>Switching a couple of amps with a Raspberry Pi and a relay</h1>

<p>
<img src="img/chip.png" alt="Chip symbol" class="article-top-image"/>
In my article on
<a href="mosfet.html">switching loads with a logic-level MOSFET</a>
I explained why using a single MOSFET, even one advertised as
"logic level", to switch currents of a few amps 
was more problematic than many experimenters think. The
problem, fundamentally, is that the ~3V available on the GPIO pins of
the Pi and similar devices is on the borderline of "logic level". 
"Logic", in cases like this, typically means the 5V logic of traditional
TTL components. Even the best-suited MOSFETs, used alone, turned out
not to be ideal.
</p>
<p>
Switching high-current loads is, of course, commonplace in microcontroller
applications. In this article I'll go into a bit of detail about using
a traditional approach -- a relay. We'll see that even the most sensitive
electromechanical relay won't work unaided with the Pi's GPIO, so we'll
need at least one transistor to help it out. Still, the transistor 
I selected only costs fourpence. I mean, literally 4p. So it's not a
major cost factor.
</p>
<p>
There's nothing new in this article, pragmatically speaking. However,
I will be going into slightly more technical depth than most
 introductions.
</p>

<h2>About relays</h2>
<p>
An electromechanical relay is one of the oldest and best-established 
switching technologies in the electronics industry, having been
invented at about the time our ancestors came down from the trees.
A direct current flowing in a coil causes two metal contacts
to become magnetically attracted, closing a circuit. 
</p>
<p>
What makes a relay useful is that the moving contacts can invariably
carry a current many times greater than that which energises the
coil. There isn't complete independence between these currents, however
-- in order to carry a large current, the switching contacts have
to be heavy, so they need a greater magnetic field to move them.
This greater field needs a greater coil current, or a greater number
of wiring turns, which in turn requires a greater coil
<i>voltage</i>. It's possible to get relays with low coil
voltages that can switch high currents, but the coil current 
will be proportionately higher.  
</p>
<p>
Another advantage of the relay over any semiconductor switching device
is the complete isolation it offers between the switching and
switched circuit. This factor is often important in applications
where electrical safety is a crucial factor. It's not impossible to
get the same level of electrical isolation as a relay using a
semiconductor design, but there will be a higher level of complexity.
</p>
<p>
The obvious disadvantages of relays are their size, weight, and noise.
In some applications the relatively slow switching speed can also
be a factor. A relay that can switch a few amps isn't hugely
larger than a comparable MOSFET, but it <i>is</i> larger. 
Another factor that you need to bear in mind is the difference between
AC and DC performance of the relay switch contacts -- but more on that
later.
</p>

<h2>Choosing a relay</h2>
<p>
The application I have in mind requires switching about 2A at about
12V DC. There are many relays on the market that can do this.
For embedded applications, particularly battery-powered ones, we 
need a relay whose coil has a low operating current at whatever
voltage is available. It's not hard to get relays that will switch
a few amps with an operating current of 40mA at 5V. It's even 
possible to get relays that will work at 3.3V, with an operating
current of maybe 60mA, but these don't seem to be easily obtainable.
I'm assuming in this article that we'll use a relay with a 5V
coil, since the Raspberry Pi runs on 5V. 
</p>
<p>
The part I'm using for this article is the HK4100F, made in China
by Hue Ke. The same (or essentially the same) part is available
rebranded by better-known suppliers, but the HK part can be had
for as little as &pound;1 in the UK, in small quantities,
if you shop around. The
wholesale price for these parts is about 20p. 
I've noticed that many suitable-looking relays are
sold by general-purpose retailers like Amazon and eBay. These parts 
may be fine, but unless the vendor provides a full technical data sheet,
it's hard to be sure.
</p>
<p>
The HK relay I'm using has a nominal coil resistance of 120 ohms, so that's 
a current of about 40 mA at 5V. Its contacts are rated for a maximum 3A at
30V DC, or 250 AC. Why the difference between AC and DC? 
</p>
<p>
The reason is that the major source of relay contact destruction is
arcing. When the contacts open, for a short time they will be
close enough together for an arc to strike between them. The 
destructiveness of the arc depends on the current being carried
when the contacts open. With an AC supply, the arc will not usually
last longer than the time it takes for the AC current to reverse --
as the current changes direction, it momentarily falls to zero, and
the arc fails. With a DC voltage, though, there's nothing to 
extinguish the arc except the motion of the contacts, so it will
burn for longer.  
</p>
<p>
Of course, the arcing I'm talking about here is a microscopic
process -- it's not the same scale of arc used for welding. Still,
the arcing will eventually wear away the contacts until they 
either become unreliable, or fuse together. So when the 
manufacturer gives different rating for AC and DC <i>the difference
is important.</i>.
</p>

<h2>Driving a relay with a transistor</h2>
<p>
So far as I know, there is no electromechanical relay that can be
driven directly from a Pi's GPIO pins. Even a relay with a 3V
coil will draw too much current. You really don't want to draw
more than a few mA from each pin. 
</p>
<p>
So we need a transistor to buffer the current, but it need not
be anything special. A traditional bipolar transistor will be
fine for this application, and cheaper than a FET. For no better
reason, really, than that I had pile of them in my parts bin,
I'm using the Fairchild SS5080(D) NPN transistor 
(<a href="https://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/SS8050-D.pdf" target="_blank">datasheet here</a>). Folks my age are probably more familiar with
the old stalwart BC108, which will also work just fine. But the 
BC108 is a metal-cased device, and costs maybe Â£1 each for small
quantity. The SS5080 costs only about 4p -- in fact, you probably
can't buy it in quantities less than 30. In addition, the SS5080
is designed for switching, such that it has a very low collector-emitter
voltage (V<sub>CE</sub>) when saturated.
</p>
<p>
Why does that matter?  These cheap, plastic parts won't dissipate a
lot of heat without damage. The heat dissipation at DC will be  
 V<sub>CE</sub> x I<sub>CE</sub>, so we want the former to be
as low as possible. We can't do anything about I<sub>CE</sub>
in this application -- it's the relay coil current.
</p>

<h2>The circuit</h2>
<p>
Here is the simple circuit.
</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="img/pi_relay.png"/>
</p>

<p>
The diode across the relay coil is the traditional "freewheel" diode.
The voltage generated across a coil by a changing current is proportional to 
the rate of change of current. In a switching application, the rate of 
change of current
can be very large -- perhaps from fully on to fully off in a microsecond.
Switching <i>on</i> the current isn't a problem, because the generated
current has a path to flow in the circuit. It's switching off the
current that's the problem. In principle, the voltage generated 
across the coil when the current switches off can be thousands
of volts. In practice, parasitic capacitances and other factors
prevent such a large voltage build-up, but it's still large
enough to cause damage. The direction of current flow in these
circumstances is in the same direction as the original DC current,
so this surplus current can flow in circuit that includes the coil
and the diode, and this current will quickly dissipate the stored 
energy. The diode
doesn't need to be particularly robust for this application --
the amount of energy that has to be dissipated is actually tiny.
the IN4001 is the conventional choice for most low-voltage
applications. 
</p>

<p>
There's really only one component choice to make in this circuit,
and that's the value of the resistor between the GPIO pin and the base of the
transistor. In practice, a large range of values will work fine, but
we still have to work out what that range is. This requires a consideration
of the properties of bipolar transistors.
</p>
<p>
In a switching circuit, we want the transistor operating in the
<i>saturation region</i> whenever it is passing any current at all. 
In the <i>linear region</i>, the current
flowing in the collector is essentially proportional to the  
current flowing in the base. The constant
of proportionality is called the <i>forward current gain</i>, and
denoted by the symbol H<sub>FE</sub>. 
</p>
<p>
Like many bipolar transistors, the SS5080 is available is 
different gain classes. Class "D" has the highest gain, which the
datasheet says will be in the range 160-300. That's a large range,
which we will have to accommodate in the design.   
</p>
<p>
The transistor is said to be <i>saturated</i> at the point when
increasing the base current causes no further increase in the
collector current. At this point, the collector-emitter
voltage V<sub>CE</sub> reaches its lowest value, for that specific
collector current. For high collector currents -- hundreds of mA --
this voltage could be a significant fraction of a volt. However,
the collector current in our circuit won't exceed about 40mA, and
we can safely assume that V<sub>CE</sub> will be zero.  
</p>
<p>
If V<sub>CE</sub> is zero, then the collector current I<sub>C</sub>
will just be the relay coil current, 40mA. It can't get any 
larger than this, because the coil resistance limits the current.
If we assume the minimum value
of  H<sub>FE</sub> -- 160 -- then the base current that will be
needed to cause saturation will be 40mA/160, or 250uA. 
</p>
<p>
What value of base resistance will allow for a base current of
at least  250uA? The voltage across the base resistor will be
determined by GPIO voltage and the transistor's base voltage.
The GPIO voltage will be about 3.2V -- near the supply voltage
of the Pi's GPIO system. For the base voltage, it's conventional
to take a voltage of 0.6V for all small transistors (in practice,
the value I measured was about 0.8V). 
</p>
<p>
So the voltage across the base resistor is 3.2 - 0.6 = 2.6V, so the
base resistance is 2.6V / 250uA = 10 kilohms. 
</p>
<p>
Note that this is a <i>maximum</i> value -- using a larger value reduces
base current in such a way that the 
transistor will be working in the linear region. We don't want this, because
the transistor will dissipate heat. But there's little harm in
using a <i>smaller</i> resistor. Making the resistor smaller
will help to cope with uncertainties
in the component parameters, and ensure that the transistor remains
saturated even if these parameters are unfavourable.
 We can't make the resistance too small, though -- we 
need to limit the current drawn from the Pi's GPIO. Making the
value 1k means that the GPIO current will be about 3mA, which is
well within the Pi's ratings. Using the highest safe base current 
is often a good idea in high-speed applications, because the higher
current will charge the (very small) base capacitance more quickly.
In this application, however, any base resistance between about 1k
and 5.6k will work with no noticeable difference. 
</p>
<p>
When I built and tested the circuit, I found that V<sub>CE</sub>
was  mere 30mV when the relay was energized, making the power
dissipation in the transistor about 1 milliwatt. 
</p>

<h2>Can we use a larger relay?</h2>
<p>
Suppose we wanted to switch 10A, rather than 2A. What would we
have to change? Well, obviously we'd need a higher-rated
relay. A 5V-coil relay that will switch 10A will typically
have a coil resistance of 70-100 ohms, so we should assume a 
coil current of 70mA. Looking at the datasheet for the transistor,
we see that this current is well within the specified range, and
the minimum V<sub>CE</sub> will be about 0.2V (not zero).
This doesn't change any of the design calculations, but it does
mean that the power dissipation will be a little higher --
0.2 * 0.04 = 8mW. Since the thermal resistance of the case is,
again according to the datasheet, 125 Celsius per watt, the
total temperature increase will be 0.008 * 125 = 1 Celsius.
This will scarcely be noticeable. So we <i>can</i> use a 
largely relay in the same circuit without making any changes. 
</p>
<p>
In fact, we could fit a substantially larger relay, but 
we'd have to be careful to check that that power dissipation
won't overheat the transistor.
</p>

<h2>What kinds of load can be switched?</h2>
<p>
The simple answer is -- whatever is compatible with the ratings
of the relay's switch contacts. Of course, while the relay might
be rated for 3 amps, that doesn't mean that it will switch 
3 amps repeatedly, forever. The relationship between lifetime and
load current is called the <i>endurance curve</i>. For the HK4100F,
the manufacturer's published endurance curve shows a lifetime
of a million actuations with a load current of 1A, but "only"
100,000 with 2A. No figures are presented for 3A so, 
although the published rated current is 3A, the lifetime is
<i>completely unknown</i> at that current. Even at 2.5A, the
lifetime is likely to be less than 1,000 operations. 
</p>
<p>
In short, you need to be very careful about relying on a manufacturer's
headline figures, and inspect the full data quite carefully.
</p>
<p>
One final pragmatic point: the HK4100F has a contact voltage rating
of 250V AC and, in principle, is suitable for switching AC mains
loads. Is that good idea? 
</p>
<p>
The problem lies in the layout of the contacts. The coil contacts are
only 2.5mm from the switch contacts. When soldered on a PCB, the clearance
between mains conductors and low-voltage conductors could be less than
1mm. That isn't close enough to cause electrical breakdown of the
insulating material or the air -- at least when it's dry. Still --
I'd want to think very hard about whether such a layout could 
provide adequate electrical safety. Relays are available with 
much greater separation between the coil and switch contacts, and
these might be safer.
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
Switching currents of a couple of amps using a microcontroller or
computer requires only simple and inexpensive components. However,
there are some subtleties in the design of such circuits that 
are often overlooked.
