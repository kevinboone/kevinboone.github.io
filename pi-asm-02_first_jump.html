<h1>ARM assembly-language programming for the Raspberry Pi</h1>
<h2>3. Using branch instructions</h2>

<p>
This example builds on the previous one by illustrating a simple
branch ("goto", "jump") instruction. It doesn't do anything more useful
-- it just does it in a slightly different way. The ARM instruction
set has many different branch instructions and, unlike in most
CPUs, we have to use branches to implement function calls as well as
jumps.
</p>

<h3>The example</h3>

<p>
Here is the example. You can build and execute it exactly the same
as the previous example (<code>as</code> followed by <code>ld</code>).
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#990000">//</font> Set exit value to a literal number<font color="#990000">,</font> by jumping to code that
<font color="#990000">//</font>  invokes sys_exit
<b><font color="#000080">.text</font></b>

<b><font color="#000080">.global</font></b> _start

<font color="#990000">//</font> Exit the program<font color="#990000">.</font>
<font color="#990000">//</font>   The exit code is always <font color="#993399">42</font>
<b><font color="#000080">exit:</font></b>
    <b><font color="#0000FF">mov</font></b>    <font color="#990000">%</font>r<font color="#993399">0</font><font color="#990000">,</font> $<font color="#993399">42</font>    
    <b><font color="#0000FF">mov</font></b>    <font color="#990000">%</font>r<font color="#993399">7</font><font color="#990000">,</font> $<font color="#993399">1</font>     <font color="#990000">//</font> sys_exit is syscall #<font color="#993399">1</font>
    swi    $<font color="#993399">0</font>          <font color="#990000">//</font> invoke syscall 

_start<font color="#990000">:</font>
    b      exit
</pre>

<h3>New ideas in this example</h3>

<p>
Notice first of all that the program does not start execution with the
first instruction in the source, as the previous one did. Execution
starts at the address labeled <code>_start</code>. At this address
there is only one instruction:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">    b      exit
</pre>

<p>
<code>b</code> is the assembly code for <b>b</b>ranch -- the most
basic way to move program execution from one address to another.
<code>exit</code> is a label -- it was defined earlier in the
code.
</p>

<h3>Branching as a means to control program flow</h3>
<p>
If we label a piece of self-contained code, then we can jump to it
from anywhere. In this example, the code that exits the program is
labeled <code>exit</code>, and it's certainly plausible that we might
need to exit the program from a number of different places. Grouping
instructions that form a self-contained unit of functionality is
one of the most basic of all programming techniques, regardless of
the language. 
</p>
<p>
In this example, the block of code that exits the program never
completes -- execution stops at the syscall. So the question what
to do afterwards never arises. Being able to execute a self-contained
piece of code, and then continue with a previous sequence of operations,
allows us to implement function calls (or subroutines, or procedures --
these terms are essentially synonymous in assembly programming). I'll
have a lot more to say about functions later.
</p>
<h3>Conditional branches -- a preview</h3>
<p>
The <code>b</code> branch is unconditional -- the program execution 
moves to the specified location, and that's that. The real power
of branching comes from <i>conditional branches</i>. These are
branches that may, or may not, be executed, depending on certain
conditions. Conditional branches are usually preceded by some
kind of test on a register -- is it greater than some number, or
less; is it zero or not. Conditional branches will become increasingly
important in later, more complex examples.
</p>

<h3>A digression -- ARM machine code</h3>
<p>
There are a number of different 32-bit ARM cores on the market, and
64-bit cores are now available, too. There are subtle variations even 
between the different 32-bit devices. In these articles I will be
focusing on the 'traditional' ARMv7 cores, which are found in most
mobile devices and many desktop ones. The instruction set is usually
just known as "ARM", although some writers use the term "AArch32"  
to distinguish it from other instructions sets that are available.
All instructions in the AArch32 set are exactly 32 bits (four
bytes) in length; this is understandable, but not a necessity,
for a CPU with a 32-bit register size.
</p>
<p>
Many ARM devices support an alternative instruction set called
"Thumb" and a few, mostly for the microcontroller market, support
Thumb exclusively. The Thumb instruction set uses predominantly
16-bit instructions. Originally, Thumb was devised as more 
space-efficient subset of AArch32, but Thumb has expanded so that it
offers overlapping functionality with AArch32. For reasons of space,
and to avoid unnecessary duplication, I won't be dealing with
Thumb at all in these articles.  
</p>
<p>
If you don't like looking at hexadecimal code, or have no interest
in the low-level design of the ARM instruction set, you won't lose
much by skipping the rest of this section.
</p>
<p>
It can be illustrative to look at the executable machine code
using a <code>disassembler</code> like <code>objdump</code>.
This will show the source code alongside the machine code
generated by the assembler.
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
<b>$ objdump -d 02_first_jump.o</b> 
00000000 <exit>:
   0:	e3a0002a 	mov	r0, #42	; 0x2a
   4:	e3a07001 	mov	r7, #1
   8:	ef000000 	svc	0x00000000

0000000c <_start>:
   c:	eafffffb 	b	0 <exit>
</pre>
<p>
It should be clear that each instruction is exactly 32 bits (eight hex
digits) long. The first digit is the <i>condition code</i>, which 
determines whether or not the instruction will actually be executed.
The value 0xE means that the instruction should be executed unconditionally.
Nearly every instruction in every example in this series will be
unconditional, except for conditional branches.
</p>
<p>
The actual instruction code is split between the second and third hex
digits, which makes it hard to pick out. The instruction code is
only four bits long, so the ARM instruction set has only sixteen basic
operations. Each of these is modified in various ways by the condition
code and immediate flag -- this is why there are (many) more 
than sixteen assembly language instructions.
</p>
<p>
The lower 5 digits encode the registers that the operation should
apply to, and/or an immediate number. The immediate number is only
11 bits long, which partly -- but not completely -- explains why 
the range of immediate values is limited in the way it is. You
should be able to pick out the immediate values 42 (0x2A) and
1 in the hex dump.
