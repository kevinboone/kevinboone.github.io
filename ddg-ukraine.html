<h1>Why I won't be dumping DuckDuckGo over Ukraine</h1>

<p>

</p>

<p>
The CEO of web search engine <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> 
made headlines this week, by suggesting that the site would start
down-ranking sites that actively spread "disinformation" about the
situation in Ukraine. The announcement was met with outrage, much of
which was said to come from "far right" sources.
</p>
<p>
I don't think you need to subscribe to a right-wing ideology to find the
idea of a web search service indulging in censorship a little discomforting.
I'm far from being an anti-establishment thinker myself, and a person of
middle-of-the-road political views. Still, I find the DuckDuckGo
decision a little worrisome.
</p>

<h2>DDG and right-wing conspiracists</h2>

<p>
It isn't entirely clear to me why DDG ever became the favoured search 
engine for right-wing conspiracists. Partly, I suppose, it's because
the more mainstream search services (Google, Bing) are thought to be
subtly promoting an establishment, pro-globalization message. More
pragmatically, though, conspiracists tend to think that their habits are
being tracked by agents of the state, for nefarious purposes. There's
no doubt that users' habits <i>are</i> being tracked by Google, et al.:
the companies are perfectly open about this. Whether users are tracked
by "big government", however, is far more speculative. 
</p>
<p>
Whatever the reasons, DDG does have a reputation for being favoured by
right-wing conspiracists, and it does seem to be the more conspiracy-minded
individuals who have been most outspoken in criticism of the recent
announcement.
</p>

<h2>Search engines as censors</h2>

<p>
DDG claims that it is not "censoring"
content -- if you search long enough, they say, even low-ranked pages will turn
up. However, sites that are ranked so low as to require extended
searching are <i>effectively</i> censored, even if this is unintentional.
</p>
<p>
It's a mistake, though, to think that any mainstream 
search engine is non-ranking. 
Such a search would be unusable, because there are so
many useless websites around. By "useless" I mean that they contain
little that is of interest to most people, or that useful content is
hugely outweighed by advertising or click-bait. There are probably millions of
websites in the world whose text contains the words "Ukraine" and
"conflict" (including this one now). 
If a user enters a search for these terms, the search
results <i>could</i> simply be returned in random order; but would
that be helpful to the user? Probably not -- we use a search engine
because we <i>don't</i> want to look through millions of hits. We
generally need the search engine to order them in some way. 
</p>
<p>
DuckDuckGo has always down-rated what it thinks of as non-useful web
sites. There are various ways to measure usefulness, of course. 
Google's "page rank" algorithm uses factors like the number of links to
a page, to determine its usefulness in a somewhat neutral way. 
Such an algorithm
stands or falls, of course, on whether "number of links" really
<i>is</i> a measure of usefulness. The Google algorithm tends to favour
large, corporate sites, simply because they are widely linked. This results
in anomalies where sites that receive many visitors can be ranked lower
than sites that receive few, simply on the basis of corporate linking
policies. Google's "censor" is, therefore, pro-corporation rather
than pro-individual. 
</p>
<p>
Some of Google's other ranking criteria are equally questionable. 
For example, Google openly down-ranks sites that do not offer 
HTTPS (encrypted) communication. This is so even for sites that do
not receive, or handle, any private data. Again, this favours business 
sites -- which usually have a need for privacy 
-- over academic and informational ones.  
</p>
<p>
It is not clear to me what specific processes DDG uses, to decide which 
sites are of higher quality. Strangely, DDG seems to be even less
transparent about this than Google is. 
</p>

<h2>Is misinformation a measure of "search quality"?</h2>

<p>
We've established, I think, that all web search engines apply some
ranking criteria, which will favour some sites over others, and that
we need them to do so.
DDG says that down-ranking sites that contain "misinformation" is
simply a way to provide better-quality 
search results. It's no different, they say, than down-ranking sites that
contain nothing but click-bait. 
</p>

<p>
This is a disingenuous argument. While factors like the number of links and
number of page visits can be assessed objectively, "disinformation"
can not. Nor, really, can factual accuracy -- there are just too many
epistemological subtleties. Rene Descartes claimed centuries ago 
that the only fact 
of which any of us can be absolutely certain is that we are conscious.  
Every other sense impression could be introduced into our minds by 
an "evil demon". This remains true today: we receive a constant stream
of information, and much of it is untrustworthy.  The so-called 
"Mandela effect" demonstrates how large
numbers of people can believe something that they could easily 
find to be false, if they took the trouble to check. 
If we humans cannot
determine objectively what is "true", what chance does a search
engine have?
</p>

<h2>But putting epistemology aside...</h2>

<p>
We would be paralysed as a species if there was truly no such thing as 
an "objective reality" that most of us could agree on, most of the time.
Despite the problems of defining what true knowledge really amounts to,
we do somehow manage to stumble through, sometimes achieving admirable
things. While it may indeed by true that we cannot know anything for
certain beyond Descartes' <i>cogito, ergo sum</i>, many things are sufficiently
close to certain that, for all practical intents and purposes, they
can be treated as such. I can't prove that the moon isn't made of
green cheese, but it isn't something I worry about. I can't prove
that the situation in Ukraine was caused by the unprovoked aggression
of a Russian egomaniac, but I'm as certain as I need to be, and so
is almost everybody else that isn't subject to a constant stream of
propaganda. 
<p>

<p>
So, while DDG may be acting beyond it's remit by choosing to favour
a particular position on Ukraine, I really can't bring myself to 
condemn them for that. That, however, is not the reason I won't be
dumping DDG.
</p>

<h2>DDG's value proposition is personal privacy, not accuracy</h2>

<p>
I've been using DDG for as long as it has existed. I have encouraged 
other people to do the same. The search results I get from Google
are, to me, nearly always more immediately useful than those I get
from DDG, but I still use DDG. 
</p>

<p>
I use it because DDG emphasises personal privacy. The service does
not record user interactions, or store them. It has nothing to sell
to advertisers that is specific to me. If I search DDG for
"latex" (the typesetting program), I don't see advertisements for 
condoms for the next three weeks. I have no real secrets -- I don't 
need them -- but it seems very important to me that people who really
<i>do</i> need privacy (journalists, victims of abuse...) can 
get it. 
</p>

<p>
Most mainstream search engines are destroyers of privacy, and are 
part of a wider privacy-destroying business culture. I don't use DDG
because its search results are less "biased" or more accurate than
anybody else's, because I've <i>never had any reason to think they
were</i>. I use it because the notion of personal privacy is, I think,
one that society ought to respect.
</p>

<p>
So, by all means, complain about DDG's stance on Ukraine. If, that is,
your conscience will allow you to do so. But don't stop supporting the
only reliable search engine in the world that is run by people 
who respect personal privacy.
