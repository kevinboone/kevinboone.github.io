<h1>Are Flatpak, et al., saving or drowning the Linux desktop?</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/container-logo.png" 
  alt="Tux logo"/>
In general, I'm 
<a href="containerfromscratch.html">enthusiastic about container technology</a>. It certainly has its place in the computing industry,
and technologies like Kubernetes make good use of it, for 
orchestrating large, diverse workloads. On the server side, 
the high levels of sandboxing that containers can provide
is an important security feature.
</p>
<p>
In the last few years, however, major Linux vendors have 
pushed the use of container technology for desktop Linux
applications, for reasons that may not stand up to
close scrutiny. I'm focusing here mostly on Flatpak, because
that's the technology I know most about; but Snap, and
Valve's proprietary gaming technology, are conceptually similar.
I'll briefly describe the problem that these technologies are
intended to solve and, in outline, how Flatpak works. I'll then explain why
these technologies might ultimately create more problems than they
solve.
</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>
Almost all general-purpose small computers run Windows or, at least, some
other operating system that is tightly controlled by a single vendor.
Desktop Linux, on the other hand, is driven by a number of competing
commercial interests, and a whole bunch of enthusiasts. Most Linux
advocates see this diversity and decentralization as a good thing.
Nevertheless, the result is that no
two Linux distributions are particularly binary-compatible. An application
built for Unbuntu might run on Fedora, but it just as likely won't. 
There isn't even good inter-version compatibility on the same distribution:
an application built for Fedora 36 might run on Fedora 35 but, well, just
as likely it won't.
</p>
<p>
For the popular applications, on mainstream Linux distributions, this
problem is relieved, for the end user, by the provision of repositories.
Each platform release has a repository that contains, in binary format,
a set of applications and libraries that are compatible with the 
platform and (we hope) with one another. 
</p>
<p>
Maintaining a general-purpose repository is a colossal undertaking. The
Fedora repository contains hundreds of applications, for dozens of
Fedora releases, each on a number of different hardware platforms. All
this stuff has to be built, packaged, and tested. Ideally, application
software providers would implement their own repositories, for each
Linux distribution and release they're prepared to support. This does,
indeed, happen for some software packages. Mostly, though, distributions
are maintained by people who are closely associated with a specific
distribution, not with a software vendor. I know from personal experience
that this kind of maintenance can be an arduous, largely thankless task. 
</p>
<p>
The existence of repositories is of no help for applications that are
too niche to be of interest to the major repositories. Some of the Linux
software
I maintain is in repositories, but most is not. I'm not going to try
to maintain my own repositories any more, because the effort far
exceeds the rewards. 
</p>
<p>
Sadly, the problem isn't just binary compatibility. If APIs are not
stable, then it might not be possible even to build an application from 
source, for a different platform release. Consequently, it's not that
unusual to see a software package drop out of a repository entirely --
perhaps for a short time, but sometimes for ever. For some time I was
unable to run the Puddletag audio tag editor on Fedora, because it 
required Python 2, and Fedora had only limited support for Python 2.
Happily, Puddletag was made available in both Snap and Flatpak formats
-- even building from source could not make it compatible otherwise. 
With desktop Linux, it's a fact of life that software packages come
and go from repositories.
</p>
<p>
Contrast this with the situation for Windows. I've written software for
Windows 95 that still works -- in binary format -- on Windows 10.
There are no repositories for Windows -- unless you count the
"Microsoft Store" -- because they were never really needed. Software
vendors could distribute binaries that would work across a whole range
of Windows versions. These days, vendors may need to adapt to the fact that
Windows runs on hardware other than x86 but, in reality, many
do not try -- 64-bit x86
still accounts for the overwhelming majority of Windows installations.
</p>
<p>
It's highly unlikely that Linux will ever be in this position. It might 
happen if a single vendor -- or very co-operative group of
vendors -- manages to achieve a complete stranglehold on the Linux
platform. I don't think it's in anybody's interests for this to
happen, although things are moving in that direction already. 
</p>

<h2>Flatpak: how it works</h2>
<p>
Flatpak is a very clever technology. It provides a way for a
developer to package an application so that it runs, not against
the platform's native system libraries, but against a curated
set of libraries provided by Flatpak <i>runtimes</i>. 
Each runtime is accompanied by an <i>SDK</i>, that provides the
basic development tools (compilers, source management 
utilities) that work for a specific runtime.
</p>
<p>
The system works by encapsulating the application along with its runtime in
an individual container. Each application sees a filesystem that is a 
composite of the container's filesystem and (almost always) some part
of the host filesystem. After all, most applications need to read and
write files. The use of containers here provides -- in principle --
an additional level of security, since containers can have processes
and resources that are separated from one another.
</p>
<p>
Each Linux distributor provides Flatpak runtimes that match its 
own platform. So, in principle, applications can be unaware of
the host's Linux platform completely -- they target the Flatpak runtime.
Because the Flatpak runtimes look exactly like Linux distributions
in their own right -- which they are -- applications generally
do not need to be changed much to target Flatpak.
</p>
<p>
In fact, if your application is built using one of the popular
build tools (<code>make</code>, CMake, meson...), and has its
source in a popular repository (<code>GitHub</code>, perhaps)
it's almost indecently easy to build a Flatpak version of
it. The Flatpak build tools really are that good. 
</p>
<p>
If your application uses less common programming languages, or has
unusual dependencies, that's not necessarily a problem -- Flatpak
has built-in dependency-management features that help out here.
At a pinch, you can build your Flatpak application completely
using command-line tools and scripts -- painful, perhaps, but
the end user isn't going to care.
</p>
<p>
Like native applications, Flatpak and Snap applications can be 
hosted in repositories. This is a much more tractable task than
hosting native applications though because, in principle, 
Flatpak and Snap applications are platform- and version- agnostic.
If the user installs a Flatpak applications that requires a different
runtime from those installed on the host, the Flatpak installer will
attempt to download the runtime as well. For the end user, it's a
very slick experience. 
</p>

<h2>What's not to like?</h2>
<p>
If this all seems a little too good to be true, well, perhaps it is.
The most obvious problem is the lack of parsimony -- these container
solutions are hugely more resource-intensive than native applications.
Storage needs, in particular, can be massively increased. 
So far as I know, the smallest Flatpak runtime is about 500Mb in size.
Whether this is a problem or not really depends on how many different
runtimes the user actually needs. If you have a bunch of small applications
that each needs a different 500Mb runtime, that's going to be very 
wasteful. 
</p>
<p>
In reality, though, the situation is far worse than this. The runtime
only provides the most basic set of libraries and utilities. In practice,
applications will bundle their own versions of libraries that are not
in the standard runtime. 
</p>
<p>
This creates the possibility -- perhaps the probability -- that the same
software components will be found, with the same versions, bundled into
many different applications. 
</p>
<p>
Storage is cheap these days, but not as cheap as it once was. 
The size of modern applications has forced us to use higher-performing,
more expensive technologies like NVMe, just to give acceptable
start-up times. As a result, off-the-shelf
computers often now ship with <i>less</i> storage than they did
five years ago. 
</p>
<p>
So Flatpak, et al., require more storage -- perhaps much more -- 
in an environment when storage
is becoming more expensive. 
</p>
<p>
There's also an increased CPU usage, because of the pseudo-virtualisation
that containers require -- but this is not usually bothersome in 
practice.
</p>
<p>
Then there's the sandbox itself. A Flatpak application is required to 
declare the host resources to which it needs access, so users are aware of
potential security implications. However, the controls are coarse-grained:
there is no notion of application-specific storage as there is, for
example, in Android. If an application requests, and is granted, access
to the user's home directory, it can access <i>any</i> part of the home
directory. Any application can modify the configuration of other 
applications, if it is stored in the home directory.
</p>
<p>
This, of course, is the same for native applications; but native
applications don't even claim to be sandboxed. Where security is 
concerned, Flatpak and the like perhaps promise more than they deliver. 
</p>
<p>
These potential problems -- resources, security -- are easy to appreciate, 
but there
are other issues that are more subtle, and arise from the measures that
have to be taken to integrate the container sandbox with the host.
</p>
<p>
Consider an simple application operation like opening a document in a
web browser. The browser isn't going to be part of the Flatpak
runtime -- the application will have to open the browser on the 
host. But the sandbox is specifically designed to prevent Flatpak
applications from spawning new processes outside the sandbox, or
even seeing that part of the host filesystem where the binaries
are installed.  
</p>
<p>
To get around this problem -- and many similar ones -- Flatpak provides
APIs that an application can use to invoke host services, like printing,
sending email, and showing notifications.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the existence of the APIs is not, in itself, a solution.
This is because most graphical desktop applications make use of
common frameworks like GTK or Qt. If a GTK-based application wants to
show a document in a web browser, it will probably call
<code>gtk_show_uri_on_window</code>. To print, it will probably use
the <code>gtk_print_operation_XXX</code> functions. 
</p>
<p>
In order for Flatkpak to work with these frameworks, <i>all
frameworks must be Flatpak-enabled</i>.  
</p>
<p>
Now, it might not be obvious why that is such a problem. And it isn't --
for the end user. It's a problem for software maintenance, though, because
GUI frameworks have become hopelessly entangled with Flatpak and other
container tools. It's difficult to maintain one without the other.
</p>
<p>
This is the same problem I wrote about in 
<a href="morelikewindows.html">more like Windows every day</a>. Unix-like
systems have the power and versatility that they do, because they are
based on a simple philosophy: each component does exactly one thing well.
What Flatpak, etc., give us is a system where all the components
depend on one another, and have overlapping functionality. In something
like Linux, where there is no overall governance, this could be
catastrophic in the long run. 
</p>

<h2>Is there a better way?</h2>
<p>
The alternative to technologies like Flatpak is rigidly to tie down
all the common platform libraries -- or, at least, their 
APIs. This is essentially what Microsoft has done with
Windows -- the core libraries have been extended over the years, but most
of the functionality that existed in 1990 is still present today.  
</p>
<p>
With a few (albeit important) exceptions, this is already happening
in Linux.
Many core Linux libraries, like GNU <code>libc</code>, OpenSSL and 
<code>libpcre</code> have not changed their APIs for years, perhaps
decades. Of course, the internal implementations have changed, but
that should not affect applications. Many libraries now have good
backward compatibility and cross-distribution compatibility.
</p>
<p>
The exceptions are the heavy-hitting desktop frameworks, like GTK. 
These seem to have breaking API changes in every release. It's
highly unlikely that a GTK 4 application built for one Linux distribution
will work on another; it might not even build from souce. 
</p>
<p>
These problems are not technical -- they relate to software governance.
They can be solved, if enough people have the will. Ironically, the
existence of Flatpak, et al., removes the incentive to solve these
human problems, as
they can be worked around. 
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Technologies like Flatpak make it relatively easy for developers of
desktop applications to
target multiple Linux distributions and versions with the
same code. That's particularly true for applications that use
commonplace build strategies. On the face of it, this is clearly
a good thing. And the technology really works -- I've used it myself,
and been surprised at how easy it is to learn and use. For Linux to
be useful as a desktop operating system, software vendors have to
support it. The easier it is to do that, the more likely vendors will
support Linux.
</p>
<p>
Whether it really is a good thing, though, depends on the side-effects.
Flatpak, et al., have the potential to increase massively the amount
of storage required on desktop and laptop computers, at a time
when storage is becoming -- in practice -- more expensive. 
To be fair, many native Linux applications have bundled 
all their dependencies,
to make it easier to support multiple distributions. This practice is
even more wasteful of storage than that adopted by Flatpak, because
Flatpak's runtimes do at least allow some components to be shared.
It's certainly possible, in principle, to make applications more
compact without relying on Flatpak, but in practice things aren't
so clear-cut.
</p>
<p>
It's difficult to sandbox end-user, GUI applications in a way that 
provides good security without compromising convenience -- anybody
who has developed for Android will surely have seen this. It's not
at all clear to me that the sandboxing provided by Flatpak is really
effective in isolating applications from one another.
</p>
<p>
Coupling containerized applications to a graphical desktop system is
inherently difficult. Flatpak's approach goes against the "do one thing
well" philosophy of Unix by introducing complicated tight coupling between
components. The long-term effects of this strategy are hard to assess.
</p>
<p>
In the end, though, Flatpak and similar technologies are solving
a problem that really ought never to have existed at all -- they are
technological solutions to what are fundamentally administrative problems.
