<h1>Adventures with Artix</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/tux.png"/>
I was rummaging through my collection of old computer stuff lately, and I came across
a really splended Toshiba laptop that I bought, I think, in 2008. That makes it
about fourteen years old. It was supplied with Microsoft Windows Vista -- a
candidate for the worst microcomputer operating system ever released -- but you 
could install Windows XP on it, which I did.
</p>
<p>
At the time, this was a highly-specified machine. It had a 1.4GHz, dual-core
CPU, and 3Gb RAM. A big selling feature was dual USB 2 ports. Best of all,
the case was made of some kind of exotic metal (magnesium?) so it weighed
under 1kg. For comparison, that makes it lighter than the latest Microsoft Surface Go,
for the same size screen.
It was, and remains, the lightest laptop computer I've ever owned. Despite its size
and weight, it includes a DVD drive, and a bunch of other features that are rarely
seen on a modern laptop, like a hardware volume control.
</p>
<p>
I'd been thinking for some time about getting a new, lightweight laptop for 
travel. It was opportune, therefore, that this one should show up when it did.
Still, since I'm not going to go back to Windows XP at my time of life, finding
the machine raises the question whether an old laptop like this 
can run a modern version of Linux.
By that I mean a modern graphical desktop, not just a console, 
even though <a href="console.html">the Linux console is awesome</a>.
</p>
<p>
My first thought -- which might have been naive -- was to install a regular, mainstream
Linux. I normally use Fedora on my laptops, but this is a heavyweight, tightly-integrated
desktop platform, 
<a href="morelikewindows.html">almost like Windows</a>. Somewhat surprisingly, Fedora 
did install, and it kind-of worked. It worked to the extent that, if this was
the only laptop computer on Earth, I could probably use it. But it took about
five minutes to boot to the graphical desktop and, once running, was constantly
swapping memory to disk. It turns out that the basic Fedora installation, with
Gnome 3 desktop, actually uses about 10Gb RAM -- even when doing nothing much.
I was able to cut this down a bit by careful removal of components but --
and this is my gripe about modern desktop Linux -- everything depends on everything
else. There comes a point where you can't remove anything, even if it appears
not to be necessary, without breaking some other part of the system.
</p>
<p>
So with some reluctance, I gave up, and looked around for an alternative.
</p>

<h2>The state of lightweight, desktop Linux in 2021</h2>

<p>
Although I have no particular objection to systemd, you can bet that any kind
of Linux that uses systemd is going to be too heavy for old, low-powered hardware.
There are (a few) Linux distributions that don't use systemd, but often this is for
ideological reasons, not to make the installation more resource-efficient. A
good non-systemd Linux is <a href="https://www.devuan.org/">Devuan</a>. 
Devuan benefits from a reduction in complexity by omitting systemd, but it's not a
"lightweight" Linux -- it still uses Pulse Audio by default, for example. I'm
really looking for something that is pared down to the essentials, but is
still capable of running a graphical desktop.
</p>

<p>
Is there such a thing? Um... Well, that's the problem. It's possible to boot a Linux
kernel on pretty much anything that has a CPU, but fully-supported distributions
that focus on low-resource hardware are thin on the ground. Of course, you can build
a Linux installation from the ground up, which is what I do for 
<a href="pi_minimal.html">embedded applications</a>. But I don't want to do
this for a desktop computer.
</p>

<p>
There are other candidates, but this time I decided to try 
<a href="https://artixlinux.org/" target="_blank">Artix</a>. 
Artix is a variant of the popular
Arch Linux, without systemd. Again, I have no principled objection to systemd --
I just don't want to run it on a system with 3Gb of RAM.
</p>

<h2>Introducing Artix</h2>
<p>
Artix is a highly-configurable, desktop-capable Linux that is capable of being
installed in a very minimal configuration. It doesn't use systemd, but offers
a range of lightweight alternatives. 
There is even a "low memory" version of Artix, that is said to boot 
with as little as 300Mb RAM. I think it's probably fair to say that Artix is
designed primarily for knowledgeable Linux users, and makes few concessions to
newcomers.
</p>
<p>
Artix uses packages from the Arch repositories, but with overrides for those
components that need to be implemented differently without systemd.
It uses the same <code>pacman</code> package manager as Arch, but configured to
retrieve files preferentially from the Artix repository, regardless of which
package requires them. In addition, there are additional packages to match
the non-systemd boot process. For example, most laptops will need to have installed
the DHCP network configurer <code>dhcpcd</code> (or something similar). 
The package for this is still called <code>dhcpcd</code>, as it is in Arch,
but there's an additional <code>dhcpcd-openrc</code> that provides the plumbing
for using it with the OpenRC boot manager, rather than systemd. To be fair,
this package management strategy does not seem to be documented at a high level,
and it took me a while to work out how to use it. I suspect it probably seems
blindingly obvious to the folks who maintain Artix, but it wasn't obvious to
me.
</p>
<p>
There were a few other non-obvious things that tripped me up, but I'll get
to those later.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<h2>Installing Artix</h2>

<p>
So far as I can tell, all installations of Artix start with booting to 
a shell from an
installation image (CD or USB). Once booted, you can proceed with the
installation, either manually, or using an automated graphical installer.
</p>
<p>
It is here that I made my first mistake. I wanted to start with a really
minimal system, and install absolutely nothing except what I needed. I didn't want
to use the graphical installer, so I downloaded the minimal installation image,
with a view to installing everything using command-line tools.
</p>
<p>
But this install image did not include any tools that would have made configuring a 
wifi network connection an agreeable experience. Had I been able to install 
a graphical desktop using this image, or even an X server, I would have had
a better selection of tools to choose from. As it is, I had to hack on 
<code>wpa_supplicant</code> 
configuration and start a stack of networking daemons manually, just to get
to be able to install the rest of the system from remote repositories. 
The base installation gets you to
a console shell, but that's all.
</p>
<p>
It turns out that a fully-configurable, command-line installation can be carried
out using any of the installer images -- including the graphical installer.
This fact is, in fact, fully documented -- but who reads documentation? Not
me, it turns out, in this case.
</p>
<p>
Having cursed myself roundly for this oversight, I cursed myself even harder
when I realized that my old laptop actually had a wired Ethernet connection
(they all did, in those days). So I need not have bothered with the wifi
configuration at all.
</p>
<p>
In short, doing a minimal installation using only command-line tools
<a href="https://wiki.artixlinux.org/Main/Installation" target="_blank">is
well documented</a>. Had this documentation page actually started with
"do yourself a favour and download the graphical installer even if you're going
to install this way" then even an idiot like me would have found it
straightforward. Of course, idiot or not, you need to be perfectly happy with
command-line operation if you want to do a fully-custom install.
</p>
<p>
If you do a really minimal install, then you'll end up with something that
boots to a console, and all the rest of the installation still to do.
If you want eventually to run a graphical desktop, you'll need to install
everything manually, choosing exactly which components you need.
In my case, I installed the XFCE4 desktop (which, surprisingly, does not have
X as a dependency -- you'll need to install that separately). I didn't have
to use anything other than <code>pacman</code> to get everything installed,
but I did have to edit the <code>pacman</code> configuration to add all
the Arch repositories as well as the Artix ones. For example, there's no
Firefox in the Artix repository, nor (so far as I can tell) no media
players. Again, the need to do this is well documented, if you have the
good sense to read the documentation.
</p>

<h2>The result</h2>

<p>
Having installed everything I needed, including the graphical desktop, I was
quite surprised at how well everything worked. I was expecting to have problems
with the old hardware, but even fussy things like suspend-to-RAM and backlight
brightness control just worked. 
</p>
<p>
Booting to a console takes about fifteen seconds, and to an X desktop session
a further ten seconds or thereabouts. Not blazingly fast, but tolerable -- and much
quicker than I was able to achieve with a regular desktop Linux. And this is
without any tweaking beyond being very carefully what I installed.
</p>
<p>
With the graphical desktop running, <code>free</code> reports that 
2.8 GiB RAM is installed, of which 2.4 GiB is available. That's only 
400Mb for the desktop and kernel -- that's a lot, compared with what we
could do with 16kB in 1982, but it's still impressive by modern standards.
There are no processes running whose function I can't identify.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this is an old machine. Whatever you can do to optimize the 
operating system
platform itself, modern software is often still too much for it. Web browsing using
Firefox is plausible, but it struggles with many modern, media-bloated sites. That's not
the fault of Firefox -- website managers (or their advertisers)
feel compelled
to use every fancy feature available. Interestingly, the Midori browser, despite
using about a quarter of the memory of Firefox for doing the same jobs, was
no faster. 
</p>
<p>
It was possible to play full-HD video files using <code>mplayer</code>, full-screen and windowed. Audio plays direct to ALSA, as it always did before Pulse Audio came along, and
this works just fine. I did not have to do anything clever to configure the
audio or video hardware, despite its age.
</p>
<p>
There's no doubt that a machine of this age behaves better when using command-line
and console tools than modern graphical ones. That suits me, for the most part,
because almost everything I do with a computer, I do in a terminal. The things
I really can't do in a terminal -- like editing photos or music notation, I tend not
to do on Linux at all. 
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, graphical applications do work, provided you're patient, and they
don't challenge the 3Gb or so of available RAM.
</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>
If you're careful, and know what you're doing, it remains possible to install
Linux on an old(-ish) and underpowered (by modern standards) computer, and use it
to do useful work. The same cannot be said for Microsoft Windows but, to be fair,
it cannot be said of mainstream Linux distributions, either. For better or worse,
mainstream Linux is designed for modern, high-powered hardware. The inefficiencies 
involved in running 168 processes just to maintain a graphical desktop -- as my
Fedora installations do -- are hardly even noticed on a 16-core CPU with 32Gb
RAM on call. As a result, there's little encouragement for developers to support
old hardware.
</p>
<p>
Systems like Artix exist, I guess, because of the hard work of enthusiasts.  
It relies on donations just to cover the cost of its infrastructure; I doubt
anybody is making any money from it. Although Linux is entirely capable of 
bringing life to old computers, none of the commercial Linux vendors have much
interest in supporting this. That's not a criticism -- after all, I work for a commercial
Linux vendor. The nature of being in commerce is to make money. 
</p>
<p>
My real worry, though,
is that this march of technology cannot continue uninterrupted. We don't have 
unlimited energy resources, or a place to dispose of the millions of tons of
CO<sub>2</sub> that are generated by running over-powered computers and
infrastructure. We should be getting a grip on this now, by embracing an 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/intermediate-technology">"intermediate technology"</a> approach to information technology whilst we still
can. The key concept in "intermediate technology" is that tools should be
appropriate to the task, and no more complex than required to complete that task.
There's no place in the modern world, with all its environmental 
problems, for a computer
user interface that shows 3D-rendered animations that serve no useful
purpose. Nor is there any need for a computer that is powerful enough to host
such a desktop, when it is only going to be used to look at websites.
</p>
<p>
Those of us who understand such problems should be supporting a simpler,
less resource-intensive approach to computing. One way in which we can do this
is to reuse old computer hardware, and encourage the continued development of
software that can run on it. Personally, I would not rule out a return to the
simplicity of the 8-bit microcomputer, but that might be a step too far at first.
a simpler Linux is, at least, a step in the right direction.
