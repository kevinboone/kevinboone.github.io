<h1 id="a-usb-power-supply-with-a-real-on-off-switch">A USB power supply
with a real on-off switch</h1>
<p><img src="img/battery.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>In an <a href="switchoff.html">earlier article</a> I wrote of my
concerns about electrical appliances that cannot be switched completely
off. Often these appliances use external power supplies (typically of
the ‘wall-wart’ variety) that make it hard to provide a real mains
switch. Partly I’m worried about the energy these devices waste, but I’m
also concerned about electrical safety. I just don’t like electrical
devices being connected to the mains supply for years on end, and I’ve
seen such devices fail catastrophically.</p>
<p>In my home, the devices that waste the most energy when they’re
apparently switched off are often the same ones that use the most energy
when they’re running – my desktop PC, XBox console, A-V amplifier, etc.
But, while I only have a few devices like this, I have <em>dozens</em>
of USB-powered devices. These invariably have a wall-wart supply that
can’t be switched off without pulling the plug from the socket and,
while they don’t waste much energy individually, I do have an awful lot
of them.</p>
<p>A particular case in point is my Astell &amp; Kern media player,
which I mostly use connected to my hi-fi system. It’s USB-powered, and
the electrical outlet I plug the wall-wart into is behind a stack of
hi-fi equipment. I can power down the player itself, but I can’t easily
disconnect the wall-wart from the electrical mains.</p>
<p>How much energy do I waste in the long term, leaving the media player
permanently connected to its USB charger? I don’t know. What are the
electrical safety implications? I don’t know that, either. Similarly, I
don’t fully understand the electrical safety implications of leaving a
wireless charging pad powered all the time. There have been reports of
these devices overheating and starting fires, when metallic objects have
fallen onto the pad. I believe that modern wireless charging pads are
resistant to this kind of accident, but do you want to take the chance?
Again, my wireless charging pad is powered by a USB wall-wart behind a
stack of equipment, and isn’t easy to disconnect when I’m not using
it.</p>
<p>I can’t believe I’m the only person on Earth who worries about being
unable to switch off USB chargers. But I’ve sought in vain a USB charger
from a reputable manufacturer that has a real mains on-off switch. It
can’t be that difficult, or expensive, to make one. Can it?</p>
<p>To find out, I decided to make one of my own, and try it out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note</em><br />
This article is about designing and constructing a mains-powered
electrical appliance. This isn’t something you should attempt unless you
have the skills or training for this kind of work. While I’m satisfied
that my design and construction is safe for its intended use, I don’t
know whether it conforms to regulatory standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>There’s nothing remotely complicated about the design of my switched
USB charger. It’s just a box containing a proprietary mains-powered USB
charger module, a switch, and a connector from the mains supply.</p>
<p>The USB charger module is of the type that is designed to be fitted
in a wall-mounting box, as part of a permanent electrical installation.
These devices typically connect to a conventional mains wiring ring,
along with socket outlets. They’re easy to use for my application as
well, as they require nothing more than live and neutral supply
connections. I’ve seen them for sale for as little as UK£2, but I
preferred to use one from a supplier I recognise. In the end I settled
on <a
href="https://www.mlaccessories.co.uk/product/3684776/dual-usb-ac-charger-module-5v-dc31a-max-155w-25x50mm-black">this
Knightsbridge part</a>.</p>
<p><img src="img/usb_psu_0.png" /></p>
<p>It’s not clear from the photo, but the USB charger module has two
shrouded screw terminals on the back, for connecting the live and
neutral of the mains supply. It can deliver 15.5W, shared between its
USB A and USB C ports. That’s not a huge amount by modern standards; but
bear in mind that these devices are designed to be used in an
installation with no ventilation. It has to run cool, even at maximum
power.</p>
<p>I used a conventional IEC ‘kettle’ connection for the mains supply
for my unit, but I would use a less heavy-duty connector if I were
building more than one of them. The supply current will never be more
than a fraction of an amp, after all. I used the IEC connector because I
already have a box-full of compatible cables.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note</em><br />
In the UK, you can’t rely on a kettle connector having anything other
than a 13-amp fuse fitted. The internal wiring of the charger has to
accommodate this. While you can – in principle – fit a smaller plug
fuse, you can’t easily prevent somebody swapping the cable for one from
an actual kettle, which probably has a 13A fuse. More on this point
later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, of course, there’s the all-important on-off switch. For
convenience, I used this <a
href="%5Bhttps://www.microminiatures.co.uk/product/illuminated-blue-rocker-switch-12v/">rocker
with built-in neon indicator</a>, which costs less than a quid. Of
course, there are many similar switches available from electronics
suppliers. The presence of the neon indicator means that the switch has
a neutral terminal, as well as the two terminals for the switch
contacts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note</em> It’s important to use a switch that is rated for mains
voltages. The <em>current</em> capacity is unimportant in this
application, but switches designed for automotive and low-voltage
applications can arc when switching higher voltages, reducing the
service life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I were to be making many of these devices, I’d get a custom
enclosure made, probably by laser cutting. Unfortunately, the cost of
single-unit laser cutting is prohibitive, so I used a cheap, generic ABS
plastic box for this prototype. It’s only cheaper to use a ready-made
box if you don’t cost your own time, of course, because manually cutting
the rectangular openings for the components is a pain in the backside.
The hole for the USB charger module, in particular, needs to be cut very
accurately, because it doesn’t have a bezel that will hide wonky
cutting.</p>
<p>Here is the bill-of-materials, excluding sundries like solder, spade
connectors, shrink-wrap sleeving, and other things that I Have in
abundance.</p>

<h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>
<p>The IEC mains socket and the rocker switch all have 6mm spade
terminals although, of course, you could solder to the terminals
directly, rather than use spade connectors. Because I consider this
device a prototype, I connected everything using s spade connectors so
that I can dismantle it and reuse the components. Spade connectors are
usually designed to be crimped to their electrical conductors, but I
soldered them as well, just to be sure. I also used extra shrink-wrap
sleeving around all the terminals, to reduce the risk of electrocution
if I should be foolish enough to run the unit with the lid removed.
Which, of course, I don’t advise.</p>
<p>If and when I make more of these chargers, I will have enclosures
laser-cut to the exact size I need.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the unit assembled and being tested on the
bench; you’ll see that there’s mostly empty space in the enclosure.</p>

<h2 id="electrical-safety-issues">Electrical safety issues</h2>
<p>The Knightsbridge USB module is designed for direct connection to a
mains supply, and does not need a protective Fuse. However, because
kettle-style mains cables usually have a 13A plug fuse, it’s important
to ensure that the internal wiring has a higher current rating than
this. Otherwise, if there were an internal short circuit in the charger,
the wiring could burn out before blowing the plug fuse. So I’ve used
internal cabling rated at 20A. It’s also important to avoid weak points
in the solder or crimp joints, that might not be able to carry the full
fault current.</p>
<p>I used an ABS case which is, of course, an electrical insulator. If I
made more of these units, I would still use some insulating, plastic
material. Doing this has the advantage that nothing needs to be earthed
and, in fact, the earth terminal of the IEC socket is not connected to
anything. If, for some reason, I wanted to use a metal case, I’d have to
pay careful attention to earthing.</p>
<p>I remain conflicted about the need for ventilation. For its regular
application, the Knightsbridge USB module is designed to run in an
unventilated enclosure; but there will be <em>some</em> dissipation of
heat through the faceplate and along the mains cabling. The
manufacturer’s documentation provides no guidance at all about heat
management.</p>
<p>So, for now, I’ve provided the prototype with a mesh of small
ventilation holes. These holes have to be small enough that there’s no
easy way to poke a metal item into them and get a shock. I still have
some load tests to do, to see whether the unit really benefits from
ventilation. I would guess that the thicker the material of the case,
the more benefit there is to additional ventilation. But, without
further testing, I really can’t be sure.</p>
<h2 id="so-how-does-it-perform">So how does it perform?</h2>
<p>For the most part, I can use my USB charger in any place I can use a
wall-wart charger. It runs cool, even when charging my laptop through
its USB-C port, and it’s easy to switch on and off. Even this hacked-up
version doesn’t look bad on my office shelf, but it’s a bit larger than
it needs to be. The size and appearance could certainly be improved.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>Since building this switchable USB charger, I’ve become aware that
some USB-powered devices don’t work with it. My Samsung DEx dock, for
example, has a USB-C power connection, but will only work with the
wall-wart power supply Samsung supplies. It isn’t just that it won’t
work with my home-made USB charger; it won’t work with <em>any</em> USB
charger but its own. I suspect I’ll discover more devices like this in
due course. So, in the unlikely event that you want to join me in my
campaign to switch things off properly, and make your own switchable USB
chargers, you should probably first ensure that your devices will
actually work with a generic charger, rather than a proprietary one.</p>
<h2 id="further-work">Further work</h2>
<p>By fiddling around with FreeCAD I’ve found that I can fit all the
parts neatly into an enclosure of size 100x80x50mm. If I were willing to
have the USB socket(s) on the front, next to the on/off switch, it could
be even smaller.</p>
<p>What might be even better, in an office environment, is to have
multiple USB sockets, each with their own on/off switch, all in a single
case. But that’s a job for another day.</p>
<p>The most expensive part of my charger is the Knightsbridge USB
module. It’s perhaps worth looking for a cheaper alternative, although
I’m concerned that really cheap devices might not meet UK standards for
electrical isolation. That could be a significant safety hazard in some
applications.</p>
<h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h2>
<p>The best way to eliminate wall-warts and other external power
supplies is to avoid buying equipment that uses them. But that’s
difficult, and even equipment with a proper mains connection (like my
Leak amplifier) might not have a real on/off switch. It blows my mind,
frankly, how little we care about this.</p>
