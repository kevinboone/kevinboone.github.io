<h1>How Unicode reading direction characters defeat source code inspection, and what it means for the open-source movement</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/unicode_logo.png" 
  alt="Unicode logo"/>
This article is about how Unicode reading direction characters 
(also known as bidirectional or "bidi" overrides) can
be used to disguise a security weakness deliberately placed into
computer source code. There are a number of reasons why such a 
weakness might be introduced -- the obvious one is to provide the
developer with an unauthorised "back door" into sensitive or 
restricted operations of
the software. This issue has been widely reported recently; some
authors are even claiming that it marks the end of the road for the
open-source software movement. I will try to explain, with an
actual program sample, how the weakness can be exploited, and then
discuss what the real-world implications are.
</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>
Consider this piece of C++ program code, displayed in a graphical
code editor. 
<p/>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/bidi-1.png" alt="sample 1">
</p>

<p>
On the face of it, it appears to be testing whether the user is
called "admin", and preventing access to some function if that 
is not the case. There's little here, I think, to raise a red
flag for anybody looking at the code.
<p/>

<p>
Here is the same piece of code, seen in the Firefox web browser
(Google Chrome displays it the same way).
<p/>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/bidi-2.png" alt="sample 2">
</p>

<p>
This is how you might see this snippet of code, if you're inspecting it using
some online source management system. Again, there's little here
to raise a concern.
<p/>

<p>
And here's how it looks in <code>vim</code>, where the
deception is clearly revealed.
<p/>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/bidi-3.png" alt="sample 3">
</p>


<p>
What originally looked like a perfectly reasonable test to restrict
access to a specific user, is revealed to allow access to almost anybody
at all. This is a classic "back door". 
<p/>

<p>
The way this subterfuge works (with most modern editors) is to
include Unicode reading direction characters in the text.
Unicode code point 0x202E is an indication that the following
characters are to be displayed right-to-left. The following
0x202D reverts back to left-to-right display. Of course, these
code points have to be encoded properly as multi-byte characters 
in the text, but that isn't
particularly difficult -- most modern editors can handle multiple
encoding formats, and will allow arbitrary Unicode code points
to be inserted. 
</p>
<p>
The text of the comment "//Only admin is allowed" is actually
embedded (backwards) in the string that is being tested for equality with 
<code>admin</code>. It is the reading direction characters that
make this substring appear to be a comment, which it isn't -- it's
part of the program logic.
</p>
<p>
There are many
perfectly legitimate reasons to switch reading direction in text --
I might, for example, want to include a sample of Hebrew or
Arabic text in my English. In this case, however, the willingness
of the code editor (or web browser) to respect reading direction
characters allows the true operation of the program to be
concealed.
<p/>

<p>
To make things worse, modern editors will allow blocks of text 
containing reading direction characters to be cut-and-pasted from
one document to another, or from a web browser to an editor. So
harmless-looking, dangerous code snippets can be propagated
from one project to another, with the programmer being
completely unaware.
<p/>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>
This isn't the first time I've written about how the flexibility and
complexity of Unicode can cause problems for programmers. I've 
remarked on
<a href="overlong.html">overlong characters</a> and <a href="combining_unicode.html">combining characters</a>, for example, both of which create the
potential for code to behave in ways that are not obvious on inspection.
The use of reading direction characters, however, provides for
greater scope of abuse. 
<p/>

<p>
These characters don't give programmers complete freedom to make a
program look, and behave, in different ways. The text still has
to be valid program code, that will actually compile and run. At the
same time, the malicious code has to be adequately concealed, in a way
that will defeat most common code editors and viewers.
Most programming languages allow any Unicode character to be
used in text strings and comments. Some allow them in identifiers
as well. Probably, the more willing the programming language is
to accept non-printing Unicode characters, the more readily it may 
be exploited. I chose an example in C++, but the same technique
would have worked in C and Java. I'm told that it works in Rust,
although I haven't tried it myself.
<p/>

<p>
The example I used to demonstrate the problem is not a particularly
imaginative one. I suspect that more creative developers could find
alarming ways to conceal back doors in their code using
techniques like this. 
<p/>

<h2>Implications</h2>

<p>
What I'm describing here is not a "crack" or an "exploit". There is no
way the technique could be used to create or exploit 
a security vulnerability in any running program. Rather, it's a way
for malicious code to be deliberately inserted by a programmer, in
a way that is hard for others to spot.
<p/>

<p>
The implications for the open-source movement are particular striking.
While I doubt that this is "the end of the road", I can see why there
is a measure of unease. Most open-source programs and libraries are
developed collaboratively, with contributions from many different 
individuals and businesses. A complex piece of software might have
hundreds of contributors, none of whom are really accountable to
one another. There might, perhaps, be somebody who is notionally
"in charge", but that person might not have detailed oversight
of every contribution. There is undoubtedly the potential for an
errant developer to sneak something nasty into the codebase; 
that this nastiness can be disguised using Unicode trickery
just makes it easier to do so.
<p/>

<p>
But here's the reason why this isn't the end of the road:
<b>open-source software is already subject to significant
problems of governance.</b> There's nothing new here -- really
there isn't. The open-source movement has created a revolution
in the software industry, but nobody who works in that industry
truly believes that open-source software is a benefit without a
cost. The fact that contributions can be made by many different
people, not all of whom are completely trustworthy, has <i>always</i> been 
an elephant in the sitting room. 
<p/>

<p>
In my professional life I work almost entirely on open-source software.
I frequently find myself looking for bugs in code that I did not
write. Sometimes I can't even identify the author. Much of this
code is exceptionally complex, and it's usually undocumented. 
Judging the quality and security of code from an unknown source is already
extremely difficult; the fact that bad code can be deliberately
concealed only contributes incrementally, not substantially, to that problem.
In my experience, security vulnerabilities in open-source code
are overwhelmingly more likely to be caused by carelessness -- including
my own -- than by malice. It takes significant effort to conceal a
defect by fiddling with Unicode characters; it's unlikely to happen
because of simple incompetence.
<p/>

<p>
Whenever you use software you did not write entirely yourself from scratch,
in assembly language, you're exposing yourself to the risk of malicious
code. Supporting your development work with open-source code has the
disadvantage that the good intentions of the contributing authors cannot
be assumed. The notional advantage is that you, and anybody else,
can inspect the code for deliberate nasties. The techniques described
in this article reduce this advantage but, frankly, it never was
much of an advantage to begin with.
<p/>

<h2>Mitigation</h2>

<p>
There's a simple solution to this problem, and to others related
to Unicode: <b>inspect code using a console</b> rather than a smart
editor. Or, if you use IDE tools, configure them to show non-printing
Unicode characters explicitly (as <code>vim</code> does). Never
trust code that you've only inspected in a Web browser, since you
can't control how it handles Unicode. Don't look at code using
Windows Notepad, or Microsoft Word, both of which can be fooled
in the same way that my Linux editor was (I checked). 
</p>
<p>
In particular,
<i>never cut and paste code from a browser into an editor</i>. 
</p>
<p>
These simple measures will not solve any of the existing problems related
to open-source governance, but they will largely prevent Unicode 
trickery being used to introduce new ones.
