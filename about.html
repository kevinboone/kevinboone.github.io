<h1>About...</h1>

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
I'm an old warhorse of the computing industry, recently retired after forty
years between the keyboard and the screen. I started my working life in medical
computing, and subsequently meandered aimlessly through medical research,
teaching, law, and back to computing. I never really had a clear idea what I
wanted to do for a living; I'm repeatedly taken by surprise when I realize
that I've reached the end of my working life without ever finding out.  Happily,
though, I guess it no longer matters. I've learned a good deal along the way,
and I like to share what I know.
</p>

<p>
Much of the content on this site is about my former professional interests:
mostly programming, math, and electronics. Since retirement, however, I've
started to write more about matters that concern me personally, particularly
Internet privacy, retro technology, and de-Googling. 
</p>

<p>
If anybody's interested, <a href="cv.html">here's my CV</a>.
</p>


<h2>About this site</h2>

<p>
I maintain this site at my own expense in the hope that, just maybe, a few
people will find my musings useful or, at least, mildly diverting.  
</p>

<p>
I don't use any AI tools: every word on the site, for better or worse, is the
product of my own limited intellect, except where I state otherwise.  I don't even
use writing aids more sophisticated than a spelling checker. I try to write a
couple of new articles every month but, given how long they take to research
and author, I don't always succeed. I don't provide a way to comment on my
posts, but I do sometimes append feedback I get by e-mail to my posts. If I do
this, it will always be added verbatim, and I'll identify the author (if I can, and
I'm permitted to). 
</p>

<p>
I do respond to constructive criticism, so feel free to contact me if you spot
a mistake or omission, and I'll try to fix it. I also respond to suggestions
for new articles, if they're on topics I'm interested in, and I have time to
research them.  However, even in retirement, I don't have unlimited time. 
</p>

<p>
Since I no longer have to care what people think of my professionalism,
I've noticed that in my recent postings I've become more sarcastic, and use more
rude words than I used to. That is, the site is becoming more <i>personal</i>.
However, I intend it to remain family-friendly
and safe for work. 
</p>

<p>
In case anybody's interested in the technical aspects: I write these articles 
using plain HTML or Markdown, and then run a bunch of Perl scripts I wrote myself
to turn them into a full website. If I were starting from scratch, I'd probably
use a static site utility like Jekyll, but you know how it is with new tricks
and old dogs.  
</p>

<p>I don't advertise or deal with commercial affiliates; I don't endorse
anything I didn't buy with my own money; I don't ask for, or accept, payment in
any form, for any reason. This site is a labour of... well, not love exactly.
It's my burden, and I carry it like Frodo Baggins carrying the One Ring to
Mordor. I sometimes wish I could throw it, like the Ring, into the fires of
Mount Doom and be rid of it, once and for all. But I've been writing it for such a
long time -- since 1994 -- that I don't feel I can stop.  </p>

<p>
My point is only this: I don't do it for money, but because I want to. If you
find anything helpful, feel free to tell me, and I'll perhaps do more of it.
If you don't, feel free to go elsewhere.
</p>


<h2 id="smallweb">About the "small web"</h2>

<p>
This website follows "small web" principles, and I'm pleased to be associated
with the
<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.kagi.com/small-web">Kagi search engine's small web initiative</a>.
</p>

<p>
Broadly, the small web is that section of the world-wide web populated by hand-written,
personal sites, free from advertising and commercial affiliation, using minimalist
design principles to present real content.
</p>

<p>
This site doesn't rely on modern browser technologies, and I try to make it
comprehensible using a text-only browser like <code>links</code>.  Not that I'm
suggesting that anybody should use a text-only browser as their primary way of
looking at the web; but it's a good way to identify cleanly-designed sites.
</p>

<p>
This site has images, but no embedded videos or anything that pops up, makes
a noise, or moves
around. I do use a bit of JavaScript, mostly on those pages that display
math. Unfortunately, plain HTML doesn't really have a way to write
mathematical equations -- not one that works across a range of browsers, anyway.
If there were one, I'd use it.
</p>

<p>
Following these principles means that loading and displaying pages from this
site should be fast, compared to the usual bloated, ad-infested, commercial
behemoths. 
</p>

<p>
There was a time when all websites were small web sites. Sadly, commercial
exploitation has turned the web into a dehumanizing, soul-sucking hellscape.
This site is my small contribution to trying to make it more fit for human
habitation again.
