<h1>Using an Oracle database as storage for the Apache Artemis message broker -- part 2</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/activemq-logo.png" 
  alt="ActiveMQ logo"/>
In the <a href="artemis_jdbc.html">first article in this series</a>, 
I explained how to set up the Artemis
message broker to use an Oracle database as its message data store.
In this article, I will explain in more detail how database
storage works.
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>This article follows directly from the previous one, and assumes the same database set-up. If you haven't read the previous article, this one won't make any sense.</blockquote>

<h2>Basic structure</h2>
<p>
If you've used Artemis with a file-based store, you'll have noticed that
the store consists of four directories, whose names are conventionally
<code>bindings</code>, <code>journal</code>, <code>large-messages</code>,
and <code>paging</code>. The database store follows the same structure
-- the schema defines four sets of tables, whose names we set up in
<code>broker.xml</code>. I used short names for these, because
Oracle limits the lenths of identifiers: in the previous articles I set my
bindings, journal, paging, and large-messages tables to be named
-- or prefixed with --
<code>B</code>, <code>M</code>, <code>MP</code>, and <code>LM</code>
respectively.
</p>
<p>
Some tables in the database schema have a broadly a 'journalling' structure, 
as
do the files in the file-based store. By that I mean that data is 
typically added to the journal, whether the operation adds or removes
data or configuration. A separate process removes database
entries (or files) that are no longer relevant.
</p>
<p>
It would be nice -- for comprehension, at least -- if the rows of the
database tables corresponded to files in the file-based store. That's
only partly true.
</p>

<h2>The bindings table</h2>
<p>
The bindings table primarily stores information about the messaging
addresses that exist, and their properties. It is a journalling table, and
the data in it is unlikely to be meaningful except to the
broker. It is, by default, indexed
on its <code>id</code> column but, in practice, this table experiences
relatively little load in most installations, and extra indexing is 
unlikely to be rewarding.
</p>

<h2>The messages/journal table</h2>
<p>
This is the analog of the <code>journal</code> directory of 
the file-based store,
and works in the same way: for every messaging operation carried out
by a client, 
the broker adds a row to the table. A 'messaging operation'
may be production or consumption of a message, but it may also be an
acknowledgement, a transaction boundary, a move between queues, or
one of many other operations. This table has a 
column <code>userrecordtype</code>
whose value indicates the operation, and which may 
sometimes be useful in troubleshooting. The values of this
column are only defined -- so far as I know -- in the class
<a href="https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis/blob/main/artemis-server/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/artemis/core/persistence/impl/journal/JournalRecordIds.java" target="_blank"/>JournalRecordIds.java</a> in the
source code.
</p>

<p>
So, for example, producing a message to the broker typically results
in the creation of two rows: a type 45 'add message' and a 
type 32 'add reference'. If the message is scheduled for later delivery,
there will additionally be a type 36 'set scheduled delivery time'. This
latter is, interestingly, also created when a message delivery fails,
and the broker must reschedule it for a later time.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of the messages/journal table is to allow the broker to 
reconstruct its internal state when it starts up. We should not assume
that the number of rows in the table accurately reflects the number
of messages in play, and there's no easy way to work out a message's
contents from the table, or what queues messages are stored on. 
</p>
<p>
Consumption of messages from the broker usually results in an 
immediate deletion from the messages/journal table, but not <i>all</i> rows
associated with the messages are deleted immediately. A background
process tidies up the journal at intervals, as is the case for the
file-based store. Certain sequences of operations might
create rows in the database table more rapidly than they can
be deleted, and this needs to be taken into account when planning
database capacity.
</p>
<p>
The paging table is indexed on its <code>id</code> column, but the 
broker often does a SELECT on it ordered by the sequence number
(<code>seq</code>) column. There might, therefore, be some benefit in
creating an additional index on the <code>seq</code> column.
</p>

<h2>The large messages table</h2>
<p>
It's not obvious why there is a 'large messages' table, when there is
also a 'messages' table. The same applies, though, to the file-based
store: this has a separate <code>large-messages/</code> directory.
</p>
<p>
In Artemis terms, a "large" message is, by definition, one that is large
enough to need to be stored on its own, rather than as part of
a journal. When we store a large message, the journal (messages table)
is <i>also</i> updated, but not with the actual data. The data goes into
the large messages table, strictly one row per message. 
</p>
<p>
So, for example, if I send to the broker a 1-million-byte binary message,
followed by a 2-million-byte binary message, then the large messages table
contains the following data: 
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
SQL&gt; select length(data) from lm;

LENGTH(DATA)
------------
     1000183
     2000183
</pre>

<p>
What is stored in the table is not an exact copy of the data I sent -- if
it were, the sizes would be 1,000,000 and 2,000,000; but clearly the data
is there, and each message has one row.  
</p>
<p>
So far as I know, the broker only SELECTs from the large-messages table
one row at a time, based on the <code>id</code> column. So I wouldn't
expect additional indexing to be beneficial.
</p>

<h2>The paging table</h2>
<p>
The paging table serves the same purpose as the <code>paging/</code> 
directory in a file-based store: it contains images of sections of
the broker's memory.
</p>
<p>
There is not only one paging directory: for each new address, the broker
creates a new table with the same schema. Broadly speaking, each row of
each table matches the paging file that would be created with a 
file-based store.
</p>
<p>
Paging often causes the most
confusion of any aspect of Artemis operation. Broadly, Artemis tries to
keep a complete copy of all messages in memory. Unlike 'classic'
ActiveMQ, which used a 'cursor' system to track messages, Artemis treats
messages in memory, and messages in storage, essentially the same --
because, conceptually, they are. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, many applications will store more message data than a 
typical JVM heap can contain, so the broker uses a system of paging to 
accommodate this situation. When the heap usage is reaching its limit,
the broker writes whole chunks of its memory-based message store to
storage. 
Configuration parameters like
<code>global-max-size</code> control when paging comes into effect, both
with database and file-based persistence. You'll typically see a
warning message in the broker's log when paging is necessary.
</p>
<p>
Paging is an inherently slow operation and, it seems to me, it's going
to be even slower when the page store is in a database. Perhaps,
if paging is likely to be necessary, it's worth experimenting with
letting the operating system do it. That is, you might allocate a large amount
of system-level swap space, and then allocate a JVM heap that is as
large as the largest message volume. The operating system will swap
memory much faster than the message broker will; the down-side of
this approach is that running a huge JVM heap potentially creates a
correspondingly huge load on the garbage collector. There's really no
way to predict whether platform paging or broker paging will work
better -- it's something that needs to be decided by testing.
</p>
<p>
In any event, given the size of the paging data elements, and the
relatively low frequency of searches, you probably won't gain much by
tuning the index.
</p>
<p>
Bear in mind that the paging table is ephemeral -- the broker can always
reconstruct it from the journal. In fact, when the broker starts, that's
exactly what it will do: it will read the journal row-by-row, and 
set up its internal memory representation of the message store. If
there is more message data than can fit into memory, the broker will begin
paging it, just as it would at run-time. This journal reconciliation can
be very time-consuming -- I typically see rates of 1000-2000 journal rows
per second. So, if your messages table has a million rows, you can expect
broker start-up to take many minutes. Often, if the messages table
contains millions of rows but there aren't millions of messages, that's because
the broker was shut down in a disorderly way. In that case, once the broker
has fully started, the database should be cleaned up. If you're using
the 'critical analyser' system to detect over-long broker jobs, it might
be necessary to disable it if you have problems the lead to slow start-up.
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
In this article I explained in outline how the Artemis broker uses 
a relational database schema to store not only message data, but all the
meta-data associated with message management. The system is ingenious, but
does not lend itself to easy management -- with a few exceptions, there's
no clear relationship between the message data and the contents of the
message store. In general, only the messages (journal) table benefits from
much tuning, and it's worth looking for ways to eliminate paging
completely, if practicable.
