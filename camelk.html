<h1>How does Camel-K actually work?</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/openshift_logo.png" 
  alt="OpenShift logo"/>
Camel-K is a relatively new technology, for deploying Apache Camel
routes directly on an OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster. The more traditional
approach to deploying Camel routes is to create an application based
on Camel, perhaps using a framework like Karaf or Spring Boot, build
it into a Docker image, and deploy that image on the cluster. 
Camel-K allows us to go directly from a route specification in some
language (Java, XML, YAML) to a running pod that implements the route.
</p>

<p>
Once set up, Camel-K is very easy to use -- just define the routes
using your language of choice (Java, XML, YAML...), and use the 
command-line tool or an
IDE plug-in to deploy to a container. Of course, a huge amount goes
on behind the scenes and, if something goes wrong, it can be rather awkward
to find out why.
</p>

<p>
In this article I'll describe in outline what actually happens on the
OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster,
when deploying a Camel route using Camel-K. I should point out from the
start that I'm going to over-simplify enormously, because the process
is extremely complex. However, I hope that this article might serve
as a starting point for understanding Camel-K better.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
I'm assuming that you've done the basic installation of the Camel-K operator
in your OpenShift or Kubernetes environment. I'm also assuming that you
have the <code>kamel</code> command-line utility, even if you're using an
IDE to build your integration code. I'll only be using command-line tools
in this article. I'm using OpenShift commands, but substituting 
Kubernetes commands should work fine (e.g., <code>kubectl get pods</code>
rather than <code>oc get pods</code>).
</p>

<p>
I'm assuming that you know about Camel in general, and at least a little
about OpenShift/Kubernetes. If you don't know what a "ConfigMap" is, 
or what a YAML file looks like, you might need to read more around
OpenShift or Kubernetes first.
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>
For the purposes of this article, I'll be using the "Hello, World" boilerplate
example, that just consumes from a timer and writes to the log:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#000080">import</font></b> org<font color="#990000">.</font>apache<font color="#990000">.</font>camel<font color="#990000">.</font>builder<font color="#990000">.</font>RouteBuilder<font color="#990000">;</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">public</font></b> <b><font color="#0000FF">class</font></b> <font color="#008080">Hello</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">extends</font></b> RouteBuilder
  <font color="#FF0000">{</font>
  @Override
  <b><font color="#0000FF">public</font></b> <font color="#009900">void</font> <b><font color="#000000">configure</font></b><font color="#990000">()</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">throws</font></b> Exception
    <font color="#FF0000">{</font>
    <b><font color="#000000">from</font></b><font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#FF0000">"timer:tick"</font><font color="#990000">)</font>
        <font color="#990000">.</font><b><font color="#000000">setBody</font></b><font color="#990000">().</font><b><font color="#000000">constant</font></b><font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#FF0000">"Hello"</font><font color="#990000">)</font>
        <font color="#990000">.</font><b><font color="#000000">to</font></b><font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#FF0000">"log:info"</font><font color="#990000">);</font>
    <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
  <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
</pre>

<p>
Note that this isn't a complete application, or even a complete
Java class. It's just the fragment of code that defines the Camel
route. In more traditional Camel programming, you'd have to build
the rest of the application around this fragment. With Camel-K
there's no need to, because the framework will supply the necessary
infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
To deploy this trivial integration from the command prompt, using 
defaults for all settings, we can just do this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ kamel run Hello.java
</pre>

<p>
But then what happens?
</p>

<h2>The role of the "integration kit"</h2>

<p>
Let's look at the pods that are running in the user's namespace, assuming
that the <code>kamel run</code>  operation succeeded. There might be
other pods present, of course, from other applications -- 
I'm only showing the ones relevant to the
current Camel-K deployment.
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>Depending on how you installed the Camel-K infrastructure, you might have a Camel-K operator pod as well. This plays no part in the present discussion, so I'll ignore it.</blockquote>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ oc get pods
NAME                                       READY     STATUS             
camel-k-kit-c505rq5062cf6c1f47mg-1-build   0/1       Completed
camel-k-kit-c505rq5062cf6c1f47mg-builder   0/1       Completed 
hello-7b7975957b-6bz5n                     1/1       Running    
</pre>

<p>
Because I did not specify a particular name for my integration, Camel-K
has just taken the name of the source file, and used it as the basis
for the pod name. The pod <code>hello-XXX</code> is, of course, the
running Camel application. If we examine its logs, we should see the
output of the Camel route:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ oc logs hello-7b7975957b-6bz5n
2021-09-14 09:58:14,144 INFO  [info] (Camel (camel-1) 
  thread #0 - timer://tick) Exchange[ExchangePattern: InOnly, BodyType: 
  String, Body: Hello]
...
</pre>

<p>
Not very exciting, but we can see that a Camel route is running.
How did we get from a snippet of Java source code, to this running
application? 
</p>

<p>
The first step in the process is for the Camel-K operator to
build an <i>integration kit</i>.
This is, in effect, an OpenShift image that contains an application
apable of constructing
new pods that run Camel routes. In the pod listing above, we have
two pods with "kit" in their name. Note that the names do not contain
"hello". The reason for this is that the same integration kit can build
multiple, different Camel applications. The contents and structure of the
integration kit depend on a number of factors:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The language used to specify the integration (Java, in this case).</p></li>
<li><p>The dependencies specified by the user (if any) when deploying the
integration source.</p></li>
<li><p>The dependencies auto-disovered by inspection of the source.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
It's entirely plausible that a single integration kit will suffice for
an entire installation, even
a large complex one, if the same source language is used.
</p>

<p>
You can see that the integration kit corresponds to an image:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ oc get is 
NAME                               IMAGE REPOSITORY
  TAGS      UPDATED
camel-k-kit-c505rq5062cf6c1f47mg   [...]/test/camel-k-kit-c505rq5062cf6mg   
  33655     About an hour ago
</pre>

<p>
If you look at the three pods (e.g., using <code>oc describe pod</code>)
you'll see that all three are actually derived from the <i>same image</i>.
That is, the integration kit creates an integration pod that is based on
exactly the same code as itself. If you're familiar with the 
OpenShift "Source-to-Image" (S2I) process, you'll have come
across cases where a pod (the "builder") creates a new image that is based
on its own image, with additional data or code. The process used by 
Camel-K looks
superficially like S2I, except that only one image is involved.
What distinguishes the "integration kit" functionality of that image,
from the "run the integration" functionality is simply the environment 
provided to the pod.
</p>

<p>
The integration kit generates a Kubernetes Deployment for the new integration.
We can see the contents of the deployment:

<pre class="codeblock">
$ oc get deployment hello -o yaml
</pre>

<p>
Note that this deployment is specific to the <i>integration</i>
we are deploying,
not to the integration <i>kit</i>, and thus has the name "hello". 
Broadly, each new Camel route deployed will result in a new Deployment
object. The
contents of the Deployment are extensive, but one thing is worthy of
note here.
</p>

<p>
Look at the <code>volumes</code> section of the Deployment:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
 volumes:
   - configMap:
       items:
       - key: content
         path: Hello.java
        name: hello-source-000
      name: i-source-000
    - configMap:
        items:
        - key: application.properties
          path: application.properties
        name: hello-application-properties
      name: application-properties
</pre>

<p>
You'll see that the entire source code of the integration, <code>Hello.java</code> has been inserted into a Kubernetes ConfigMap, as has a configuration
file <code>application.properties</code>. This latter name might put you
in mind of a Spring Boot application and, in fact, Camel-K did at one
time use Spring Boot as its application framework. More recent versions
use Quarkus, but many of the Spring Boot names have been retained for
compatibility.
</p>

<p>
We can see the source code by examining the ConfigMap: 
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ oc get configmap hello-source-000 -o yaml

apiVersion: v1
data:
  content: |+
    import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;
    public class Hello extends RouteBuilder
    ....
</pre>


<p>
The original source <code>Hello.java</code> is embeded in
an entry in the ConfigMap called <code>content</code>, as 
the Deployment stipulates.
It is these ConfigMaps that essentially distinguish one integration from
another, when they are built using the same integration kit, and are
based on exactly the same image.
</p>

<p>
In short, the integration kit has taken the supplied integration source
code, put it in a ConfigMap, and then built a Deployment that will run
a pod with the ConfigMap available. When the pod starts, it will be
responsible for turning the integration source from the ConfigMap
into a running Camel
application.
</p>

<h2>Building the Quarkus application from the source</h2>

<p>
That it is the integration pod, not the integration kit or the <code>kamel</code> utility, that is responsible for building the Camel application can
easily be seen by deploying a Camel route with
a syntax error. Let's create <code>Hello2.java</code> with a deliberate
error (it's not relevant what the error is).
</p>

<p>
Now when I deploy the source using <code>kamel run</code>, it gives
every impression of being successful:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ kamel run Hello2.java 
$ kamel get

NAME	PHASE	KIT
hello	Running	...
hello2	Running	...
</pre>

<p>
Eh? How can a deliberately broken integration be "Running"? It's running
because the integration kit got as far as creating a Deployment: 
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ oc get deployment
NAME      READY     UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
hello     1/1       2            2           68m
hello2    0/1       1            0           54m
</pre>

<p>
It's clear that something is wrong, however -- the deployment
<code>hello2</code> has zero pods running.
However, so far as Camel-K is concerned, once a Deployment is successfully
created, the integration is "running", even if it quite plainly isn't.
This can be a little confusing, if you aren't familiar with the
build process.
</p>

<p>
That the Camel route isn't running is easy enough to see if we 
look at the pods:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ oc get pods

NAME                                       READY     STATUS             
hello2-64bdd49c9d-4r9bq                    0/1       CrashLoopBackOff   
</pre>

<p>
This pod hasn't started, and it isn't ever going to start. To find out
why, we can look at its logs:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
ReflectException: Compilation error: /Hello2.java:10: error: not a statement
    foo
    ^
/Hello2.java:10: error: ';' expected
    foo
</pre>

<p>
There's a trivial syntax error in the Java code, which is pretty clear
in the log, so the pod can't start. OpenShift will try to restart it,
but it isn't going to work any better, however many times it tries.
</p>

<p>
The problem of not
being immediately aware of problems in the Camel source can be
ameliorated by running <code>kamel run</code> with the <code>--logs</code>
switch, which causes the integration pods logs to be printed to 
the console. 
</p>

<p>
So we can see that the integration pod is responsible for taking the
source code provided by the integration kit (via a ConfigMap) and
building it into a Camel route. I'll have more to say about the implications
of this design decision later.
</p>

<p>
If there is any magic in Camel-K, this is where it is. The Camel-K 
runner in the integration pod turns the snippet of code in <code>Hello.java</code> into a full Java application based on the Quarkus framework, and then
runs it. It does this entirely in memory -- no intermediate files are
generated. Rebuilding the application on starting the integration
pod is time-consuming, and will increase the start-up time of the pod. 
However, there
are significant advantages when it comes to redeployment, as I'll
explain later.
</p>

<p>
Let's see what happens when creating an integration using a different
language. Here is the "Hello, World" example expressed in YAML:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#990000">-</font> from<font color="#990000">:</font>
    uri<font color="#990000">:</font> <font color="#FF0000">"timer:yaml"</font>
    parameters<font color="#990000">:</font>
      period<font color="#990000">:</font> <font color="#FF0000">"1000"</font>
    steps<font color="#990000">:</font>
      <font color="#990000">-</font> set<font color="#990000">-</font>body<font color="#990000">:</font>
          constant<font color="#990000">:</font> <font color="#FF0000">"Hello Camel K from yaml"</font>
      <font color="#990000">-</font> to<font color="#990000">:</font> <font color="#FF0000">"log:info"</font>
</pre>

<p>
Deploy this in the usual way:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ kamel run Hello3.yaml
$ kamel get
NAME	PHASE		KIT
hello	Running
hello2	Running
hello3	Building Kit
</pre>

<p>
Notice that Camel-K is building a new integration kit for this integration,
although it would not have done so for another Java route (with the
same dependencies). When this operation is complete, you'll see
(e.g., using <code>oc get is</code>) that a new image has been created
for the integration kit (and for the integrations it deploys, 
as discussed above).
</p>
<p>
If fact, although <code>Hello3.yaml</code> is a route specified in 
YAML, the route is still converted into a Quarkus application, and
executed using a Java JVM. The construction is, in fact, almost
identical between the Java and YAML examples. So it's worth asking
why we need different integration kits at all. The answer seems to lie in
the dependencies: the YAML integration kit installs a large number
of Java software components for processing YAML; these are not needed
in the Java example. In other respects, these integration kits are
almost identical.
</p>
<p>
The potential advantage of maintaining separate integration kits --
despite the complexity it adds to Camel-K -- is that the number of
dependencies needed for a particular integration can be minimized. 
YAML support is not needed for a Camel route that is neither expressed
in YAML, nor processes YAML. Consequently, using a different integration
kit for YAML-based routes allows the necessary dependencies to be
added only to those routes. This distinction is not hugely important when
running Java code using traditional JVMs, but it may become increasingly
relevant when using newer technologies like GraalVM. The underlying
principle -- which is not yet fully realized -- is to match integration
kits as closely as possible to classes of Camel route.
</p>

<h2>Redeployment</h2>

<p>
A significant feature of the Camel-K deployment model is that deploying
new code does not require the creation of any new OpenShift/Kubernetes image 
-- so long as it uses the same integration kit. 
This is a marked difference from most Camel-based development methodologies
for OpenShift/Kubernetes -- in most cases, the way to run changed code
is to build and deploy a new Docker image, which is not exactly speedy.
</p>

<p>
Deploying a modified route to Camel-K amounts to changing 
the contents of the source
in a ConfigMap, and then restarting any pods that are consuming code from
that ConfigMap. The pods still have to build a Quarkus application
from the new code, but that's generally a lot faster than building a new
image.
</p>

<p>
The <code>kamel</code> command-line tool even has a "developer" mode,
activitated by running
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ kamel run [file] --dev 
</pre>

<p>
In this mode, the <code>kamel</code> utility runs in the background,
watching for changes to the source file. When changes are detected,
they are redeployed, and take effect as a new integration pod can be
spun up. In practice, this takes a few seconds for sources of modest
complexity. Developer mode also enables <code>--logs</code>, so
errors are more apparent.
</p>

<p>
It has to be admitted, I think, that this improvement in development
turn-around time comes at the expense of an increase pod start-up time,
because the application to be build from source each time.
In practice, it's only the user's code that has to be built -- plus a little
boilerplate -- since the Quarkus framework is built into the image as
a series of JAR files. So pod start-up time isn't usually more than a second
or so. Still, in a "serverless" environment, where the number of running
pods scales up and down on demand, this additional start-up time could
be significant. 
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>

<p>
I've tried to provide an overview of the way that Camel-K takes snippets
of Camel source code, in a variety of different languages, and generates a
running application on OpenShift or Kubernetes. The infrastructure that
makes this possible is fairly complex, and the design decisions involved
do embody some compromises. Camel-K is a relatively new technology, and
it's implementation has already changed somewhat since its first release.
There's still work to do, and I think we can expect further improvements
in future.
