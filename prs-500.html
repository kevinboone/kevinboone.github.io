don’t make them like that any more: Sony PRS-500 e-reader</h1>
<p><img src="img/book_logo.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>I bought my Sony PRS-500 on the very day it appeared in shops in the
UK. This was September 2006, I recall, at least a year before the first
Amazon Kindle hit the UK’s shelves.</p>
<p>The PRS-500 was a revolutionary product. In a review at that time, I
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s about time somebody produced a gadget which combined the
advantages of computer technology (high storage capacity, rapid
searching) with the advantages of real paper books (easy on the eyes;
straightforward user interface; low power consumption).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leaving aside the rather odd implication that printed books had “low
power consumption”, I think I captured the novelty of e-ink e-readers.
Of course, e-ink displays are two-a-penny these days. You can even get
e-ink badges for conferences. It’s just not an exciting technology in
2024.</p>
<p>But, as a person who read novels on a Palm Pilot, I found the PRS-500
remarkable. It was the first device I owned with a screen that worked
even direct sunlight, so I could read in the back yard, or on the beach.
E-ink screens uses no power to maintain the display, only to change it.
So the PRS had a battery life of about one full novel to a charge. This
was a radical improvement over any backlit LCD display, then or since.
It is mostly these features – daylight-readability and long battery life
– that continue make e-readers attractive nearly twenty years on.</p>
<p>But the PRS-500 had something that modern e-readers lack: real
buttons you could push.</p>
<p>The basic format and capabilities of an e-book reader have scarcely
changed since 2006: even if you weren’t born then, you’ll recognize the
PRS-500 as an e-reader, just from its construction.</p>
<p><img src="img/prs-500.jpg" class="regular-inline-image" /></p>
<p>You’ll see from photo that, unlike a modern Kindle, the PRS has a
heap of physical buttons. Kobo e-readers still have a couple of
page-turn buttons, but the latest Kindles have no buttons at all. It’s
possible to operate the PRS one-handed, and the modern Kobos can at
least turn the page, but I’ve never figured out how to do even this much
with a modern Kindle. I’ve been told that the generally-accepted way to
turn the page on a Kindle, when you’re holding it one-handed, is to tap
the screen against your nose.</p>
<p>Of course, the PRS-500 had to have physical buttons, because
touch-screen e-ink panels did not exist at the time. Nor did
front-lighting, which is commonplace in modern e-readers. If you wanted
to read the PRS in the dark, you had to use a flashlight.</p>
<p>The PRS-500 had an SD card slot, which turned out to be crucial, and
(naturally) a slot for Sony’s proprietary memory cards. It was almost
the same shape, size, and weight as the contemporary Kobo Forma. In
fact, the weight was academic, because we all kept our e-readers in
stout protective cases that weighed more than the devices. Twenty years
ago, we wouldn’t have risked using these expensive devices without a
case.</p>
<p>The PRS-500 wasn’t Sony’s first e-reader, although it was the first
to have any kind of commercial success. Sony so crippled its forerunner,
the <em>Librie</em>, with DRM and copy protection that it was almost
unusable. To be fair, the early Kindles had the same problem; but Amazon
got away with it, while Sony didn’t, because they had such a huge
catalog of books. Kindle owners didn’t have to seek out and install
books from other sources.</p>
<p>While Sony did have an on-line store-front, it offered far fewer
titles than Amazon’s. Restricting the Librie to Sony’s limited catalog
was not a winning strategy.</p>
<p>The PRS-500, however, moderated Sony’s DRM policy; a good thing,
because Sony’s store-front did not even extend beyond the USA for the
first year after it released the PRS-500. Owners could install DRM-free
books in several different formats, including RTF and plain text. This
made the whole of the Gutenberg collection available, as well as content
scraped from websites and converted. It continues to amuse me to see
Kindle owners paying hard coin for public-domain books by Dickens and
Austen, when they could just get them from Gutenberg.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as a Linux user, I found the PRS unsatisfactory in a
number of ways. It used a proprietary USB protocol for installing files
so, although the PRS could handle documents in several formats, you
couldn’t get them onto the device. Linux users could still copy files
onto an SD card, and then install the SD card in the reader; but this
approach came with certain limitations. In particular, we couldn’t
organize files on the SD card into collections. There was also a general
suspicion – one that I was never able to test fully – that using the SD
card for storage reduced battery life.</p>
<p>But the most bizarre problem for a Linux user was that it never
became possible to charge the PRS over USB from a Linux computer – some
secret code was needed to enable the internal battery charger. Only
Sony’s Windows software could provide this code. This wasn’t a
show-stopper because Sony supplied the PRS with a separate battery
charger, but it was a limitation that had no business existing, even in
2006.</p>
<p>The PRS had an internal memory capacity of only about 100Mb, but that
was sufficient for text and RTF novels – a user could fit more books
into memory than the device could manage, given its clunky user
interface.</p>
<p>At the time of launch, the PRS-500 attracted mostly negative reviews.
A year later the first Kindle, despite being a less capable device, with
all the same technical limitations and more, was mostly well received.
Partly, I think, this is because Amazon had the content-purchasing part
of the ownership experience all worked out. Sony’s store was fiddly to
use – even where it was available – and never had even close to the
number of books that Amazon’s had. But I suspect that, by the time
Amazon released the Kindle, consumers had become more receptive to
e-readers in general. Even the latest and greatest e-readers are poor
substitutes for a real, printed book, but we now see the advantages. In
2006, reviewers saw mostly the disadvantages.</p>
<p>Like all early e-readers, the PRS-500 suffered from ‘ghosting’, where
a page turn leaves a faint after-image of the previous page. This
continues to be a potential problem with e-ink technology, and the
Kindles didn’t handle it any better than the PRS.</p>
<p>A bigger problem, perhaps, was that the PRS-500 had a quirky user
interface, and navigating within books was pretty awkward. I suspect
that some of the apparent illogicalities of the user interface resulted
from Sony’s attempts to accommodate the limitations of the e-ink
display. Redrawing the screen took a second or more, which made it
difficult to implement a conventional, menu-based interface. So, even
though the PRS included an audio player (with a headphone jack), I was
deterred from using it by its hostile user interface.</p>
<p>Sony did go on to release new PRS models, with larger,
touch-sensitive screens and back-lighting but, in fact, none of the
models had much commercial success. The PRS-505 fixed the stupid
limitation in USB charging, so it could be charged from any USB port or
charger. This version also made it possible to copy document files
directly to the internal storage, rather than forcing users to grapple
with the proprietary Windows software. The PRS-505 was the first
e-reader that was straightforward to use with Linux.</p>
<p>By the time Sony had released these improved models, they were in
direct competition with Amazon, and before long they also had to compete
with Barnes and Noble and Rakuten Kobo as well. With hindsight, though,
I have to wonder whether Sony really had its heart in e-books? They
certainly didn’t seem to fight very hard to keep that line of business.
Amazon <em>did</em> have its heart in the battle, and pushed its Kindle
products agressively.</p>
<p>The PRS appealed to geeky readers for the same reason that the Kobo
readers do today: you could find and install your own content, without
using the vendor’s store-front. The PRS-505 was compatible with Linux,
even though the PRS-500 had been problematic. But reading is a
relatively mainstream activity, and I doubt that ‘geek appeal’ alone
would have kept a product alive – not in the face of such intense
competition. What was needed, and Sony never had, was an extensive range
of affordable books, and a straightforward way to buy and read them.
Barnes and Noble had that; even Kobo had (and has) it to some
extent.</p>
<p>In the end, Sony pulled out of the e-book market in 2014, after only
eight years. They abandoned a technology that they had made
comparatively mainstream without much fuss or notice.</p>
<p>These days, the original PRS-500 isn’t much use to anybody, but the
PRS-505 remains a useful e-reader, which can be picked up second-hand
for a few pounds. There’s no on-line store-front, but it remains
possible to copy DRM-free books to it in many formats, including EPUB.
But, best of all, the physical buttons are just so much nicer to use
than an e-ink touch-screen.</p>
