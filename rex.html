don’t make them like that any more: the Xircom REX 6000 PDA</h1>
<p><img src="img/rex.jpg" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>I imagine that anybody interested in the history of technology has
heard of the <em>Palm Pilot</em> PDAs, that were wildly popular at the
beginning of the millennium. These iconic devices were the first, truly
successful pocket computers, although they were not the first consumer
PDAs – the Psion <em>Organizer</em> range was already well-established
by that time.</p>
<p>The Palms could manage calendar and contact information, and store
short documents. They had a graphical display, unlike the early Psion
devices, with a handwriting recognition pad. They were a trendy and
productive alternative to a paper pocket diary, which was the only
realistic alternative at the time, if you didn’t want the bulk of a
Psion. The Palm III could synchronize to a PC, using a desktop docking
station and a serial cable – a real, RS232 serial cable in those
days.</p>
<p>The problem with the Palm and Psion devices was their size – or so it
seemed at the time. In a weird reversal, of the kind that often happens
in consumer electronics, many people are now carrying around smartphones
with huge screens, that are bigger and heavier than a Palm III. Still,
we tended to consider the size as a disadvantage twenty-or-so years
ago.</p>
<p>And so the REX. Even if you’re interested in the history of
technology, you may well not have heard of this device. It actually
appeared on the market around 1997, produced by the Franklin company,
which was better-known for its pocket dictionaries and translators. But
it didn’t enjoy its brief flare of popularity until Franklin sold the
rights to REX to Xircom, which was itself purchased by Intel in
2001.</p>
<p>What made the REX 6000 special was its miniscule size. It did the
same kinds of things that the Palm and Psion products did, but it did
them in a package little bigger than a credit card. When I first saw one
– in one of the many electronics shops that used to populate London’s
Tottenham Court Road – my eyes almost popped: I’d never seen anything
like it, and I knew immediately that I had to have one.</p>
<p>Almost the whole surface of the REX device was the LCD screen, as you
can see in the photo:</p>
<p><img src="img/rex.jpg" class="regular-inline-image" /></p>
<p>What’s less clear from the photo is that this device is, in fact, a
PCMCIA card. At the time of the REX, and the Palm III, almost every
laptop computer had a PCMCIA slot. Typically these slots were used for
connecting external disks and network cards. REX’s innovation was that
the entire device was a self-contained PCMCIA card.</p>
<p>So, in principle, keeping your REX synchronized just meant plugging
it from time to time into the PCMCIA slot on your laptop. If you didn’t
have a laptop, there was a PCMCIA-to-serial adapter for a desktop
computer.</p>
<p>Unlike the Palm devices, REX didn’t have handwriting recognition. You
had to enter text using a tiny virtual keyboard and a stylus (which was
included). This was less a problem than it might seem because, in
practice, users did most of the actual data entry on a PC. The REX was
supposed to synchronize to Microsoft Outlook, although it came with its
own, PC-based PDA application as well. There was also an online service,
rex.net, that provided news articles and weather forecasts that you
could transfer to the REX.</p>
<p>The REX was a technological marvel, and ought to have been a success.
With the REX I could keep all my contact details, appointments, and
to-do lists in my wallet, along with a couple of ebooks (I had better
eyesight in those days). It wasn’t all that expensive – about £100 in
2001, which is about £200 in today’s money.</p>
<p>The REX did not fail because it was too expensive, or because some
better product displaced it. It failed because Intel, its new owner, was
not interested in it. Intel most likely did not buy Xircom to get its
hands on the REX: probably Intel was interested in Xircom’s PC network
adapters, which were very popular. The REX would have seemed like an
out-of-place oddity to Intel. So, within weeks of Intel’s taking control
of Xircom, they closed down the rex.net service. The bugs in the REX
Windows software – and there were many – were never fixed. And so users
drifted away, and potential customers continued to use their Palms or
Psions until, presumably, the rise of the smartphone.</p>
<p>During its short life, the REX had an enthusiastic user and developer
community, although probably not as vigorous as the Palm community.
Still, enthusiasts managed to produce a number of useful add-on
applications, despite the total lack of support from Intel. The REX used
a Z80-compatible CPU, so there was no shortage of tools that could
produce code for it. The real problem was the lack of documentation on
the device’s internals. It was also difficult to use it in any
productive way under Linux. To be fair, the Windows software was so
buggy that there wasn’t really a productive way to use it under Windows,
either – REX never really got past the proof-of-concept stage under
Xircom, and Intel’s lack of interest prevented it going further. It was
the lack of Linux support that led to me selling my REX – only a few
months after buying it so rapturously – something I now regret.</p>
<p>No other portable computing device had the form factor of the REX in
2001, and none has now. To be fair, there’s no demand for a
PCMCIA-shaped pocket computing device, because nobody uses PCMCIA any
more. But there’s potentially a demand for a credit-card computer, when
we consider what could be packed into a device this size with modern
technology. But these days we’re so welded to our smartphones that any
REX-like device faces insurmountable competition.</p>
<p>If you want a REX 6000 in your collection, you can still find them on
on-line auction sites. But you’ll have to be patient, and be willing to
pay more than you might expect. You probably won’t able to do anything
useful with it – unless you’re willing to run Windows 98 and put up with
the terrible, buggy software. But the hardware will probably work fine,
because these devices were indestructible. And they used
widely-available, user-replaceable batteries: something that modern
manufacturers would do well to emulate.</p>
