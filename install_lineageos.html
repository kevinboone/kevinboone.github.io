notes on installing Lineage OS on modern-ish Samsung Android
devices</h1>
<p><img src="img/lineage_logo.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>This article provides some supplementary notes about installing<br />
Lineage OS on modern-ish Samsung devices, and rooting them (in that
order). At the time of writing, the most modern device that Lineage
supports is the S20 FE; the oldest is probably the S8. Unofficial
versions exist for some other devices.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to supplant the <a
href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">official Lineage
instructions</a>, which are already quite thorough. All I seek to do is
to add my own experiences, in the hope that I can save somebody some
time and frustration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note</em><br />
I install Lineage OS on my cellphones to de-Google them. It’s certainly
possible to install Google stuff under Lineage OS, and also to install
stubs of Google services to fool applications into thinking that these
services are available. However, I’m specifically trying to avoid Google
services, so I won’t be describing how to do any of that in this article
(because I don’t know).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please be aware that there’s a lot more I don’t know about the
process of installing Lineage OS. I have successfully installed it on
the S10, S10+, S10e, Note 9, and S5e (Wifi). The last of these is a
tablet; the rest are smartphones. The installation process is the same
for all of them once you get the custom recovery software installed (see
below). It’s possible that you can install the custom recovery the same
way on all devices, too – but the Lineage OS instructions are different
in this regard for different devices, and I’ve generally followed
them.</p>
<p>In particular, some devices are documented as using the Odin tool to
install the custom recovery, others use Heimdall. More on this point
later.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure about whether installing Lineage OS is right for
you, please see at least the ‘Things to watch out for’ section at the
end of this article. It might help you make up your mind.</p>
<h2 id="basic-principles">Basic principles</h2>
<p>Assuming that you’re starting from a stock, up-to-date Samsung
device, installation and rooting has four main parts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlock the bootloader. This is essentially irreversible, and will
delete all data. Make a backup first.</li>
<li>Install a custom recovery image. The purpose of the custom recovery
is to write the operating system image (and perhaps other things) to the
device’s flash memory. Over the years there have been many custom
recovery applications; the most common is probably TWRP. Lineage OS has
its own custom recovery, and that’s all I’ve used with Samsung devices.
Samsung devices have a built-in recovery mode, but it will only install
Samsung software. This – installing the custom recovery – is the part of
the process that requires Odin or Heimdall.</li>
<li>Use the custom recovery image to install Lineage OS. This part of
the process uses the <code>adb sideload</code> command.</li>
<li>Install Magisk to provide root access, if required.</li>
</ul>
<p>I should point out that installing Lineage OS does not require a
rooted device, and it will not root the device itself. Lineage OS used
to have its own mechanism for enabling root access, but the maintainers
now recommend Magisk.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>You’ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A computer with the <code>adb</code> utility. This is released by
Google as part of the Android ‘platform tools’ package, and is widely
available for most platforms. This is a command-line utility, and I’m
assuming you know how to run <code>adb</code> at a prompt on your
computer.</li>
<li>Either Odin or Heimdall, depending on the device. It <em>may</em> be
possible to use these interchangeably, but I have not been brave enough
to try. Odin is available as a graphical utility for Windows and Mac,
and a command-line utility for Linux. The Linux version is called
<code>odin4</code> and is available, at the time of writing, from <a
href="https://magiskzip.com/download/download-official-samsung-odin4-tool-for-linux/">here</a>.
However, you might need to do some web searching, as these tools can be
a bit elusive.</li>
<li>A USB C cable, and a working USB port on the device. The USB ports
on Samsung devices are precarious, and data transfer tends to fail after
a while, even if charging still works. I don’t know any way to install
Lineage OS <em>without</em> a working USB port.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would strongly recommend that, before going any further, you learn
and practice the button-press combinations needed to be able to get into
the various “special modes”. You’ll need to be able to do these fluently
and at speed, or you’ll end up repeating various parts of the
installation, perhaps several times.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-into-special-modes">How to get into special
modes</h2>
<p>Installing Lineage OS on a Samsung device requires being able to
start the device in particular special modes: “download” mode, and
“recovery” mode.</p>
<p>For full details you’ll need to check the specific instructions for
your device on the Lineage OS website. However, I’ve found that the
following work for all my Samsung cellphones.</p>
<p>If you’ve already installed Lineage OS – you’re trying to install
Magisk for rooting, for example – the easiest way to get into the
special modes is to do so directly from the Lineage user interface. To
do this, enable the ‘Advanced restart’ feature from the Settings app.
Then the power-off menu will have an additional ‘Restart’ button that
allows direct entry into download mode or recovery mode.</p>
<p>If you don’t have Lineage OS installed yet – and you probably don’t,
if you’re reading this – then you’ll need to learn and practice the
finger-breaking button combinations below.</p>
<h3 id="download-mode">Download mode</h3>
<p>This is the mode you need for installing a custom recovery image
using the Heimdall or Odin utilities. With the device powered off, press
and hold the volume-down and bixby buttons, then plug in the USB cable.
Unless you have three hands, it takes some practice to complete these
steps.</p>
<h3 id="recovery-mode">Recovery mode</h3>
<p>This is the mode you’ll need for installing Lineage OS using the
custom recovery menu. With the device powered off, press and hold
volume-up, bixby, and power, for a long time, until the recovery screen
appears.</p>
<p>If you’re currently running Android or Lineage OS, and your device is
connected to a computer, you might be able to get into recovery mode by
running <code>adb reboot recovery</code>. If this works, it might put
the recovery utility directly into ‘sideload’ mode (see below), which
will save a couple fo button-presses. But I’ve found it doesn’t always
work for me.</p>
<h3 id="hard-power-off">Hard power-off</h3>
<p>To power off when there seems to be no other way to do so, press and
hold the volume-down and power buttons together, and hold them for at
least ten seconds, or until the screen switches off.</p>
<p>This isn’t just for emergencies – there are steps in the official
documentation that require a hard power-off as part of the
installation.</p>
<h3 id="from-download-mode-to-recovery-mode">From download mode to
recovery mode</h3>
<p>This is the most fiddly mode switch of all, and you have to be able
to get it right. If you fail, you’ll probably have to install the custom
recovery from scratch and try again.</p>
<p>With the device in download mode, and having finished downloading the
custom recovery, do a hard power-off followed <em>immediately</em> by
recovery mode. That is, hold volume-down and power until the screen
switches off and then, within half a second or so, press and hold the
volume-up, bixby, and power buttons together.</p>
<p>This process is very fiddly, and I get it wrong as often as right,
even after practice.</p>
<h2 id="bootloader-unlock-issues">Bootloader unlock issues</h2>
<p>The first step in the installation of Lineage OS, or any custom ROM,
is to unlock the bootloader.</p>
<p>The Lineage OS instructions say to enable developer mode on the
device, and then find the ‘Enable OEM Unlocking’ control in the Settings
app. What they don’t say is that you won’t even see this control if
there is no WiFi connection. I have no idea why this is the case, and
I’m not sure whether anybody else does. I’ve been caught out by this
many times, because installing Lineage is usually the very first thing I
do on a cellphone. So I usually rush through all the initial set-up
steps, to get as quickly as possible to the Settings app. But if you
don’t enable WiFi, you won’t be able to enable the bootloader unlock
mode when you get there.</p>
<p>There are many reports of how certain devices don’t even have the
‘Enable OEM Unlocking’ control. These seem to be devices that are locked
to some specific cellular carrier. I don’t think it’s possible to
proceed without completing this step successfully.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note</em><br />
Although it’s stated in the Lineage installation instructions, it bears
repeating: unlocking the bootloader will erase all data on the device
and, even if you proceed no further, certain features of the device will
be lost, particularly those concerned with media DRM. There’s really no
going back, beyond this point.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="installing-the-custom-recovery-software">Installing the custom
recovery software</h2>
<p>Depending on the device, the instructions say to use Odin or
Heimdall. Although these utilities have many functions, only one is
needed to flash the recovery utility. The second-trickiest part of the
process is getting into ‘download’ mode to begin it (see above).
Thereafter it’s just a matter of running the appropriate Odin or
Heimdall commands, which are well-documented.</p>
<p>The trickiest part is getting from download mode to recovery mode
without actually starting Android. The finger-breaker for this is also
described above and, although I know I’m repeating myself, it’s good to
practice it until you can do it without getting your fingers in a
tangle.</p>
<p>The problem is that if you leave download mode <em>without</em>
entering recovery mode, the device will reboot normally, and restart
Samsung’s Android. Doing this will overwrite the custom recovery with
the Samsung stock recovery, which is no use to us. So it’s crucial to go
straight from download mode to recovery mode.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-custom-recovery-to-install-lineage-os">Using the
custom recovery to install Lineage OS</h2>
<p>When you boot into recovery mode, either now or after installing
Lineage, you should see the Lineage OS custom recovery. This recovery
utility has large, white text on a purple background and is
<em>touch-sensitive</em>. If you see lots of tiny text, and the menus
are not touch sensitive, then you’re not running the Lineage recovery,
but the stock Samsung one. This is no use for installing anything except
Samsung software.</p>
<p>So if you’re in this situation, you’ll need to retry the installation
of the custom recovery.</p>
<p>Installing Lineage OS from the custom recovery is easy, and
well-documented. You’ll need to use the recovery menus to perform a
factory data erase, and then ‘Apply update’. You can then use the
<code>adb sideload</code> command to send the appropriate Lineage OS
image to the device. This will take a few minutes, and then you’ll be
back at the recovery menu.</p>
<p>It’s possible to install Google stuff at this point and, according to
the documentation, you need to do so before starting Lineage OS for the
first time. I’ve never done this, so I can’t comment further. I just
reboot here, and start Lineage OS.</p>
<h2 id="rooting-using-magisk">Rooting using Magisk</h2>
<p>This is now the approved way to root Lineage OS. Magisk has two parts
to it – some firmware which is executed at boot time, and a regular
Android app. I believe there are various ways to install these
components; I’m just describing the method that works for me.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Obtain the Magisk installer APK <a
href="https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk">from GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>Enter recovery mode, and install the APK using
<code>adb sideload</code>, as you did to install Lineage OS itself. It’s
normal to get a ‘Signature verification error’ message at this
point.</li>
<li>Reboot into Lineage OS.</li>
<li>You’ll see a new app, entitled ‘Magisk’, with a generic Android
logo. This is just a stub to download the rest of Magisk. Run this
app.</li>
<li>When prompted, tell the downloader stub to download the full
app.</li>
<li>When the full app has installed, run it. You’ll be told that
additional steps are required.</li>
<li>When prompted, choose ‘Direct installation’. This will install some
software and reboot the device.</li>
</ol>
<p>To test that root access is now possible, I usually install a
terminal emulator like Termux. Then I run <code>su</code> in the
terminal. This should cause Magisk to pop up a confirmation box and, if
you grant permission for root access, the prompt in the terminal will
change from <code>$</code> to <code>#</code>. Other software that
requires root access should also work, although you’ll need to approve
their access when Magisk prompts.</p>
<h2 id="things-to-watch-out-for">Things to watch out for</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you get error messages about permissions from <code>adb</code>,
bear in mind that the missing permissions are probably on the host
computer, not the Android device. You might need to run <code>adb</code>
as an administrative user.</li>
<li>If you’re installing Lineage without Google services, you’ll have to
find some way to install apps – if you need any – without using the
Google Play Store. A good starting point is to install the F-Droid app,
which you can get as an APK from <a href="https://f-droid.org/">the
F-Droid website</a> using the built-in web browser. You can get apps
from other places in APK format, but you shouldn’t expect too much –
most proprietary apps assume the availability of Google services.</li>
<li>On some Samsung devices, you can expect to get a warning message
about the risks of using unofficial software every time you reboot. I
don’t know why this applies to some devices and not others.</li>
<li>Lineage OS can be upgraded in place between minor versions, e.g.,
from 20.0 to 20.1. However, there is no simple upgrade between major
versions – you’ll have to start from scratch, and be prepared to
reinstall all your apps and data.</li>
<li>Unlocking the bootloader will trip the ‘Knox fuse’ on the main
board. Even if you can find some way to reinstall the original Samsung
firmware – which is difficult – the Knox fuse is a physical device that
cannot be reset in software. You might struggle to get a cellphone
repaired under Samsung’s warranty terms, if you’ve tripped the Knox
fuse. There really is no going back.</li>
