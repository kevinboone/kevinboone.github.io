<h1>Some thoughts on a DS1302 real-time clock board for RC2014/Z80 and CP/M</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/chip.png" 
  alt="Chip logo"/>
This article in one of my series 
<a href="rc2014.html">Adventures with RC2014, Z80, and CP/M</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's always struck me as odd, and short-sighted, that CP/M did not mandate the
presence of a real-time clock. Not only does this mean that files can't have
timestamps, a whole bunch of useful utilities, that need to know the date,
become irritating because you have to supply the date each time you use them. 
</p>
<p>
So the first thing I constructed for my new Z80 system, which uses the RC2014
bus for connecting components, was a real-time clock. 
</p>

<h2>Choice of design</h2>

<p>
My Z80 system uses Wayne
Warthen's ROMWBW BIOS, so I wanted an RTC design that was supported by the
ROMWBW firmware. Why? I have only modest skill in assembling electronic
devices, and comparably modest skill at assembly-language programming; taken
together, these factors add up to a whole lot of incompetence. While I
do intend to use my own code to interact with the RTC, I wanted a 
way to be sure I had built something that works first. Then at least
I could eliminate my inadequate programming from the troubleshooting
(good thing too, it turned out).
</p>
<p>
Although ROMWBW supports (IIUC) six different RTC designs, the only one
I could find that is well-documented, with readily available parts, is
the one by Ed Brindley.
Full plans for this design are available in 
<a href="https://github.com/electrified/rc2014-ds1302-rtc" target="_blank">a GitHub repository</a>; 
in particular, there is a 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/electrified/rc2014-ds1302-rtc/blob/main/rc2014-ds1302-rtc.pdf">circuit diagram</a>, to which I'll refer
later.
</p>
<p>
Although bare PCBs are sometimes available for this type of equipment, I 
bought a complete kit from
<a href="https://z80kits.com/shop/ds1302-real-time-clock-module/" target="_blank">Z80kits</a>. Although this kit contains all the parts (apart from the
battery), you'll need at least modest soldering skills to put it together.
And decent eyesight, or a desktop magnifier.
</p>

<h2>Construction</h2>
<p>
So far as I know, there are no detailed assembly instructions. I don't know
if I didn't look hard enough, or if the suppliers just thought it would be
obvious. The GitHub repository has close-up photos of the assembled board and,
although assembly was straightforward, a few things stumped me.
</p>
<p>
First, the in-line resistor network (RN1 on the circuit diagram) 
has no obvious 'pin 1' indicator, although 
the location of pin 1 is marked on the PCB. I had to work out which was
pin 1 with a meter. 
</p>
<p>
Second -- and this continues to baffle me -- the PCB has 39 terminals on
its edge, not the 40 of the RC2014 bus. The kit was supplied with a 
40-way header, and I think cutting it down to 39 pins would be a mistake,
as it wouldn't be clear how to plug it in into the backplane. But leaving
the header at its original length means that one of the pins just dangles,
and isn't connected to anything.
</p>
<p>
Making the PCB this way does make it 0.1 inches shorter, and I wonder whether
it was perhaps designed to fit into some sort of enclosure? Anyway, this
was a real head-scratcher.
</p>
<p>
Third, the documentation on the GitHub repository says that the 'preferred'
port address for this unit is 0xC0. However, ROMWBW (at least, the version
I have) assumes 0x0C. These two numbers are similar enough -- at least to
a numpty like me -- for me to set the board up with the wrong port address
at first. This led to about three hours of unnecessary fault-finding.
So it's a good job I wasn't writing the software as well, as I would have
been trying to troubleshoot hardware and software at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Once I had the address set properly, the board just worked. Leaving aside
the confusion caused by the address, it only took an hour to assemble
and test, and I have no great skill at this kind of thing.
</p>

<p>
The photo below shows the completed board, plugged into an SC130 
motherboard for testing.

</p>

<h2>The design</h2>
<p>
The hardware design is simple, leaving the CPU and application software
to do most of the heavy lifting. A conventional 74688 (U1) address decoder
determines when the RTC board is being addressed by its port, and a bunch of
XOR gates combine this port detection with the general read and write
lines from the bus, to distinguish reads and writes on the board's port.
The bus data lines are captured by a 74174 latch, triggered by the
decoded write signal. The captured data lines are used to drive the clock,
chip enable, and I/O pins on the DS1302 clock chip (U4). 
</p>
<p>
The clock chip itself uses a three-wire serial interface, and the 
CPU and application have the job of bit-banging the serial data by
the correct sequence of reads and writes on the bus -- the board itself
does not do any of this work. I guess an alternative approach would be
to use some sort of shift register and clock to do the serial/parallel
conversion on the board. This would make programming easier, at the expense
of doubling the chip count. 
</p>

<h2>Using the RTC board with CP/M and ROMWBW</h2>
<p>
The ROMWBW implementation of CP/M is supplied with a simple utility
<code>RTC.COM</code> that can get and set the time and date. It's a little
fiddly to use, but worked well enough to test the board.
</p>
<p>
The ROMWBW BIOS also has documented function calls that applications can
use to read and write the RTC registers. So a simple way to get the 
date and time in a Z80 assembly-language program could be:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">LD   HL<font color="#990000">,</font> dtbuff
LD   B<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#993399">020h</font> <i><font color="#9A1900">; Function code for get time</font></i>
<b><font color="#0000FF">CALL</font></b> <font color="#993399">0FFF0h</font>  <i><font color="#9A1900">; Call BIOS</font></i>

<b><font color="#000080">dtbuff:</font></b>
    <b><font color="#0000FF">db</font></b> <font color="#993399">0</font><font color="#990000">,</font><font color="#993399">0</font><font color="#990000">,</font><font color="#993399">0</font><font color="#990000">,</font><font color="#993399">0</font><font color="#990000">,</font><font color="#993399">0</font><font color="#990000">,</font><font color="#993399">0</font>
</pre>

<p>
On exit, the six bytes of <code>dtbuff</code> will be populated with
year, month, day, hour, minute, and second values. These will be in
binary-coded decimal -- presumably because that's how the clock chip
supplies the data. Converting to ordinary binary is simple enough.
</p>
<p>
On a CP/M system that <i>doesn't</i> have ROMWBW BIOS, you'll have
to use whatever software is available (if any), or write your own
code to drive the serial interface of the DS3201. 
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
Assembling the RTC board was easy enough -- at least using a 
professionally-made PCB. All the parts are neatly laid out, and there's 
little fiddly soldering. A couple of glitches in documentation made the
process a bit more awkward than it needed to be, although a person who
is more experienced at this kind of construction may have been less
easily misled. 
</p>
<p>
The design and construction are period-authentic; that is, there are no 
secret microcontrollers or surface-mount parts.
