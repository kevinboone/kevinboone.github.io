<h1>Why the fascination with retrocomputing?</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/terminal.png" 
  alt="terminal"/>
It's a grey, drizzly Saturday in September, and I'm wandering around
a large exhibition hall full of men -- and it's <i>all</i> 
men -- in Cambridge, 
looking at odd bits of electronic equipment. There are various display
stands, some with functioning computer-like artefacts, and some
with components and parts. Later, a middle-aged
gentleman is going to get up on the little stage and demonstrate
his lovingly-restored Heathkit H8. There's a mood of anticipation simmering
among the two hundred-or-so visitors.
</p>
<p>
No, really, there is.
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure whether to be surprised or unnerved that I'm
looking at almost exactly the same kind of equipment, displayed
by exactly the same kinds of people, that I saw when I used
to go with my teenaged friends to the Microcomputer Show in 
Kensington Olympia back in the 1970s. Many of the items on display
are in such good condition that they could have been lost in a 
time warp in South London for the last forty years.
</p>
<p>
This, you see, is a retrocomputing fair. People come from all 
over the world to see, buy, and sell computer equipment
from the 1970s and 80s.
</p>
<p>
And to talk about it, of course. There are endless conversations,
carried out in a jargon that few non-specialists would even
understand, about products that most people living today
will never have used. I learn, for example, about the effectiveness of
the Commodore Amiga's user interface's cooperative multithreading
model, and the competing technologies for self-lubricating
dot-matrix printer pins. And so on.
</p>

 to run on</i>

<p>

A fascination with early computing equipment and software is
hardly a new thing, but retrocomputing seems to be
undergoing a real boom right now. There are specialist
publications, auction sites, and retail outlets that 
specialize in supplying the growing market, 
not
to mention the regular exhibitions and festivals.
People are restoring old equipment, repurposing it,
emulating it, and hybridizing it -- you can buy a kit
of parts that will allow a Raspberry Pi to be integrated into 
a Commodore Vic 20, for example. People
are finding new ways to play 1980s video games, and
even all-text games like Infocom's <i>Zork</i>
series. There's even a small but enthusiastic 
user group for obsolete word
processors like <i>Wordstar</i>. 
</p>
<p>
For the most part, retrocompting is a hobby,
but I think that most people involved in the hobby
actually work in the computing industry, or are
training to. I suppose
it isn't unheard of for professionals to take an
interest in the historic aspects of their trades -- in 
some cases this is an integral part of the professional
culture. Still, I don't think that professional drivers
are more likely than anybody else to restore
vintage cars, or nurses to collect Victorian bed-pans.
There's something about old computers and software the
exercises the imagination of contemporary IT professionals. 
</p>
<p>
But why?
</p>
<p>
To some extent, the explanation is probably nothing more than
good old nostalgia.
My Sinclair ZX81 never ran very well, but it dates from
a time when <i>I</i> ran a whole lot better. Many of us
like to be surrounded by the trappings or our youth, however little 
we may have regarded them at the time.
</p>

<figure style="float:right; width: 400px; margin-left: 1em">

 <figcaption>
 <i>
 Not all computers from the 80s are desirable, even when rare. 
 I've owned my Camputers Lynx since 1983, and I'm still waiting
 for it to become a valuable collector's item
 </i>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Still, I don't think that's the only explanation. Many retrocomputing
enthusiasts I know were not even born -- not even close to being
born -- when the Zilog Z80 was king of the 8-bit CPU hill.  
Yet these are people who are writing new operating systems to work with
home-brew computers based on the venerable Z80. Although it had
a remarkable 30-year uninterrupted production run, the original
Z80 is no longer made, and enthusiasts take pleasure in
scavenging them from old game consoles.
</p>
<p>
Old computers are not, for the most part, things of beauty, or even evocative
of a lost culture, like steam locomotives or duelling pistols.
</p>
<p>
Nor can it reasonably claimed that old technology is generally
superior to what we have now. There are some industries
where 'vintage' often does mean 'better' -- I have a wooden tool-chest
in my workshop that was made in 1880, and has already outlived
several cheap plastic ones. 
</p>
<p>
No: it's hard to conceive of many senses in which a BBC Microcomputer
-- amazing as it was for its day -- is functionally superior to
a modern laptop. Even a bottom-of-the-market smartphone has 
a hundred times more 
computing power than a BBC Micro, and costs -- in real terms -- about
a twentieth as much (a Model B cost about &pound;300, at a time when
a pint of beer in a pub cost about 30p).
</p>
<p>

 These classic IBM beige keyboards were made by the tens of thousands,
 and then scrapped by the tens of thousands when cheap, lightweight,
 ruuber dome key switches were developed. Now businesses are making
 replicas of these, for the video gaming market

<p>

</p>

<p>
I think the appeal of vintage computers and software is simply
that they were comprehensible. You could learn most of what 
you needed to program a Sinclair Spectrum in an afternoon;
in a week, you could learn <i>everything</i>. Things weren't
all that much more complicated in the industrial and commercial
worlds than they were for home computers -- perhaps software
was more involved, and programmers had more peripheral devices
to deal with but, in the end, you were working with a fully-documented,
reasonably stable environment. In these pre-Web days, any 
respectable mini-computer came with a shelf-full of printed manuals and,
if the information you needed wasn't in there, you could 
telephone the designers.
</p>
<p>
As far as software was concerned, either you wrote it, or a colleague
did. Even the most complicated program could be printed out in
its entirety on a book-sized stack of fan-fold paper.
</p>
<p>
By comparison, consider what I worked on in my day-job
today: it's a message routing system for a large telecoms 
operator. The part I was working on consists of a number of message
brokers from different vendors, connected by a set of applications.
The applications use Apache Camel (a Java message processing framework
on Spring Boot (an application server and transaction
management framework). The Spring Boot
applications run on Java virtual machines, which run in 
Docker lightweight containers, managed by Kubernetes
(a container management framework) on virtual machines on 
a cloud deployment framework on another set of virtual machines,
on Linux, which runs on hardware from a dozen different vendors.
The applications' logs are collected by FluentD and logstash  (log aggregators)
and visualized using Kibana (a data visualizer) and ElasticSearch
(a search engine). Performance metrics are exposed by Prometheus
(a metrics collector),
where they are analyzed and display by Grafana (a data graphing framework).
Each application has a management agent (Jolokia) which communicates
with a cluster-wide administration framework (custom written).
</p>
<p>
And so on. And on.
</p>
<p>
And that's not including all the other technologies I have to deal 
with indirectly when working on this system: TLS and certificate 
management, relational databases
and SQL queries, highly complex build management pipelines, debugging
tools, network analysis tools, three different programming languages... 
</p>
<p>
Worst of all, not a single one of these technologies even existed
when I started my working life. Half of them did not exist even
five years ago. By the time this system is ready to go into
service, it will be based on software that is already
obsolete, and which nobody will understand five years from now.
</p>
<p>
Then, when I finished work, I went home and wrote a program in C that 
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/fbclock">displays a clock directly
on a Raspberry Pi's display hardware</a>.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
Now, I'm not saying I don't understand the technologies I work with.
On the contrary, after fifteen years I think understand 
Java-based middleware development about as well as anybody in the industry.
But it's still only a fraction of what there is to know. Maybe,
being generous to myself, I might know ten times as much as a raw
computer science graduate; but knowing one millionth part of what
there is to know is only a little better than knowing one ten-millionth.
But in 1985 I knew <i>everything</i> there was to know about programming a
GEC microcontroller in GEM BASIC. I could even make repairs to it
using a soldering iron.
</p>
<p>
In the end, this is why I think IT professionals are drawn to vintage
computing -- we now all spend our working days in near-complete
ignorance. However much we know, it's only a tiny fraction
of what there is to know. Modern computer systems and software
are based on the work of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of different
people, and outside of our own particular specialities, we know
almost nothing. It's fairly common in my line of work for
there to be almost no knowledge overlap between professional
groups -- it's difficult sometimes even to have a productive
conversation about system design, because the various stakeholders
don't speak the same language, even when they speak the same
language, if you see what I mean.
</p>
<p>
I wonder sometimes whether, say, a Samsung Tab S6 will one day be
a collectable piece of vintage equipment (the cynical answer, of course, is
"tomorrow"). I suspect not because, for better or worse, people entering
the IT industry now are used to working in a climate of ignorance. 
People no longer even <i>expect</i> to have a full understanding
of the technology they use, even as technical professionals. Being
bothered by such things seems to be a province of folks like me, who
started their computing careers in the days when your PC came with
a circuit diagram.
</p>
<p>
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to work out how connect a wifi modem
to my RML-380Z.
