<h1>Why switching high currents using a MOSFET and a Raspberry Pi is not as straightforward as it looks</h1>

<p>
<img src="img/mosfet.png" alt="MOSFET symbol" class="article-top-image"/>
It's become popular to think of a MOSFET transistor as a kind of 
'electronic switch' -- apply a voltage greater than some threshold 
to the gate terminal, and the drain-source circuit changes from being
an insulator to a conductor. The gate itself draws no appreciable
current -- not at DC anyway -- so it's possible to connect a 
bunch of these devices to the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi, or 
similar device, and use them to switch high currents, without 
drawing any current from the Pi.
</p>
<p>
However, the situation really isn't as simple as that. Using a single
MOSFET transistor for power switching is simple and low-cost, but
it often doesn't work as well as expected. Either the switched device
doesn't run at full capacity, or the MOSFET gets hot. This article explains 
why.
</p>

<h2>A simple circuit</h2>
<p>
Here's a typical circuit. I want to use a Raspberry Pi, whose
GPIO pins can handle a maximum of a few tens of milliamps, to
switch a bunch of 12V LEDs, drawing a total of 4 amps.
Clearly I can't connect these LEDs directly to the GPIO
pins -- not without needing to replace the board soon after. 
The MOSFET I've chosen -- the Fairchild FQP 30N06L -- is a
common part, which is rated for a drain current greater than 30A and
a drain voltage over 60V. The gate threshold voltage is
stated to be "1.0V-2.5V", which is smaller than the Pi's
GPIO voltage of ~3.5V. This part certainly looks like it will
do the trick. 
</p>
<p>
But does the simple MOSFET circuit actually work?
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/mosfet_circuit.png"/>
</p>

<p>
Well, yes and no. It <i>may</i> work, depending on what you mean by 'work',
and what the application is.
</p>

<h2>Gate threshold voltage explained</h2>

<p>
The two parameters that circuit designer typically look for in the
manufacturer's data sheet -- those who look at all -- are the 
gate threshold voltage (V<sub>GS</sub>) and the 'on' resistance
(R<sub>DS(on)</sub>). The gate threshold is usually taken to be the point
at which the device 'switches on', and the 'on' resistance is the resistance
between drain and source when it does. The data sheet for the 
FQP 30N06L cites two maximum R<sub>DS(on)</sub> values -- 45 milliohms 
with a gate voltage of 5V, and 35 milliohms with a gate voltage of 10V.
The fact that there are two figures, and both the gate voltage 
figures are <i>well</i> above the gate threshold voltage (1-2.5V) should
be a clue that things are not as straightforward as we might like.
</p>
<p>
It's worth bearing in mind that the MOSFET I've selected is
advertised as being a 'logic' part -- it's designed to work with
gate voltages comparable with digital circuits. 
However, 'logic' in this sense is a term that
stems from the days when logic circuits invariably operated at 5V.
The Pi, and most similar systems, have 3V-4V internal voltage rails, 
with GPIO pin
voltages of the order 3.5V. So although 3.5V is somewhat above the
gate threshold voltage, it's not a voltage that the manufacturer
has chosen to provide a specific R<sub>DS(on)</sub> figure for.
There's a reason for that: the gate threshold voltage is the 
point at which the device <i>just starts to switch on</i>. For
reliable switching operation, ideally the gate voltage needs
to be much larger than this figure. A 'logic' MOSFET stands at
least a fighting chance of working with the Raspberry Pi GPIO;
non-logic parts typically have threshold voltages greater
than five volts, and stand essentially no chance.
</p>

<h2>But will it work?</h2>

<p>
Even with a logic-compatible MOSFET like the one I've chosen,
the device isn't "on" in any meaningful sense with a 3.5 V
gate voltage. What does that mean? Most obviously, the manufacturer
does not quote an R<sub>DS(on)</sub> figure, so we can't work out
the power dissipation in the MOSFET by a simple multiplication. Instead,
we need to look at the manufacturer's output characteristic -- 
see the graph below. Note that this graph shows <i>typical</i>
characteristics -- a point which I'll return to later.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/mosfet_output.png"/>
</p>

<p>
The output characteristic shows the relationship between the 
DC drain current and drain-source voltage, for particular gate
voltages. For clarity, I've marked with a red line the current of
interest in this case -- 4 amps. 
</p>

<p>
You'll notice that, as the gate voltage increases, the traces become
increasingly bunched together. There's not a huge difference, at
drain currents below 20A or so, between the traces for gate voltages between
5 and 10 volts. To be sure, there <i>is</i> a difference, and it
might be significant at very high currents; but it's much less marked
than the difference between a gate voltage of 5V, and the 3.5 where
we are working.
</p>
<p>
At 3.5V gate voltage, the drain-source voltage is about 0.2V, as near
as I can read it on the chart. You'll see people referring to the
'on' resistance in cases like this but, to be honest, it's a meaningless
term -- in these conditions, the MOSFET does not really operate like
a simple resistor. Nevertheless, we can multiply the drain voltage and
current to give the power dissipation -- 4A x 0.2V = 0.8W. 
</p>
<p>
The fact that 0.2V is dropped between drain and source is not a 
significant problem -- there's still 11.8 V led to operate the 12V LED 
array, which will be fine. But 
is that power dissipation a problem? 
</p>
<p>
It's certainly well within the limits of the part -- it's rated to
dissipate about 80W. I should point out that the FQP part is a substantial
transistor, with a built-in heatsink. We aren't working anywhere near
its limits. Or are we?
</p>
<p>
Looking at the manufacturer's thermal characteristics we see 
that the thermal resistance
without additional heatsinking is 62.5 Celsius per Watt. That means
that there will be an estimated 62.5 x 0.8 = 50 degree temperature rise.
That's still well within limits but, if you feel that running a transistor
at ~70 Celsius just to switch 4A is a bit, well, sloppy -- you should.
Apart from the fact that it's just not very elegant, I'm not sure it will
do much for the long-term reliability. And if you had to switch 8A
rather than 4A, you could well be into bolt-on heatsink territory.
</p>

<h2>Improving the situation</h2>
<p>
Looking at the output-characteristic graph again, for a gate voltage
of 5V, we see that the drain-source voltage is 0.11V, as near as I 
can read it, which isn't very near.
Since the device is really 'on' in this situation, it's
probably more accurate to work out the voltage drop from the data sheet 
(R<sub>DS(on)</sub>)
which is 'typically' 35 milliohms at a gate voltage
of 5V. This gives a drain-source voltage of 4A x 0.035 ohms = 0.14V.  
The power dissipation is now 4 * 0.14 = 0.56 Watts, and the 
junction temperature without additional heatsink is 35 Celcius above
ambient. So we might expect the device to get warm to the touch,
but not burning hot. 
</p>

<p>
To get a more useful gate voltage, we need something to shift the
GPIO logic level to 5V. It's easy to do that with a single
transistor, if we don't might the logic being inverted (load powered
on when GPIO voltage is low). If we want the logic with the same
polarity, we'll need to use a level-shifting IC or, if there's just
one MOSFET to switch, use a three-transistor design like the
<a href="https://quadmeup.com/raspberry-pi-mosfet-high-power-switch/"
  target="_blank">good example here</a>.
I might somewhat increase the value of the 10k resistor in this example, to
accommodate the few Pi's I've heard about whose GPIO voltage was
at the low end of the 3-4V range. Note that the three-transistor
design has the additional advantage that, if any of the transistors
fails and becomes a short-circuit, there still won't be appreciable
current applied to the GPIO pin by accident. In my original circuit,
I could have put a resistor of, say, 10k between the MOSFET
gate and the GPIO, which would have had the same effect. The gate
resistance is so high that the additional resistance will not
affect the operation. Power-switching transistors are prone to failure
and, when they do fail, they tend to become a short circuit. We wouldn't
want a transistor failure to take out the Pi as well.
</p>

<h2>But what does 'typical' mean?</h2>

<p>
I've repeatedly used the term 'typical' but, unfortunately, semiconductor
devices have a range of characteristics, and it's perhaps inadvisable
to assume that the typical values apply.  The data sheet gives minimum
and maxmimum values for some parameters, and it's probably safe to
rely on those values -- or, at least, to ask for a refund if you 
can't. But the graphs, like output characteristics, are only
'typical' and it's worth asking how much in error they can be.
</p>
<p>
The data sheet for the FQP 30N06L gives 'typical' and
'maximum' values of R<sub>DS(on)</sub> at a gate voltage of 
5V as 35-45 milliohms. <i>That's a 30 percent difference</i>. When
we read values of drain-source voltage for a specific current from
the output characteristic, we are working out something that is
<i>like</i> an 'on' resistance. It's probably safest to assume that 
calculated values are potentially in error by as much as the data
sheet's specific numerical values. 
</p>
<p>
So the 0.8W power consumption we determined above might actually
be as much as 1W, and the temperature rise could be nearer to 
70 than to 50 Celsius. Again, it's probably within limits --
but it's not very reassuring. For a one-off build, or for experimentation,
you'll probably get away with it, but I wouldn't recommend going
into mass-production with a design where components might run this hot.
Apart from anything else, all the device parameters, including
the gate threshold and R<sub>DS(on)</sub>, vary considerably with
temperature. This makes it even harder to rely on the calculated figures. 
</p>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
The only time it's safe to rely on a quoted value of 
 R<sub>DS(on)</sub> is when the transistor is really, truly 'on'; and it
won't be on with the kinds of GPIO voltage that Raspberry Pis and
similar devices provide. In this situation, you'll need to look at
the typical voltage-current graphs, and bear in mind that 
they could be in error by a significant percentage. You'll need to allow
for the effect that the drain-source resistance has on the voltage
supplied to the load, and the amount of heat that will be dissipated
in the transistor.
</p>
<p>
So far as I know, there are no power-switching MOSFETs on the market
that are really suitable for direct connection to a Raspberry Pi
GPIO. You'll get away with using a 'logic' MOSFET for some
undemanding applications, but it's not ideal.
