don’t make ’em like that any more: things you can switch off</h1>
<p><img src="img/battery.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>Back in the day, most electrical or electronic appliances had an
on/off switch. When you switched an appliance off, it was really off; it
consumed no energy.</p>
<p>In 2024, the only electrical appliance in my house that I can
actually switch off when I’m not using it, without disconnecting it from
the electricity supply, is my toaster. Everything else, without
exception, consumes some small amount of energy, even when it appears to
be switched off. In this article I consider how much energy I’m wasting,
and whether it really matters. Of course, <em>any</em> wasted energy is
a bad thing for the natural environment; a more pragmatic question is
how significant is our abandonment of on/off switches, compared to other
ways in which we waste energy every day?</p>
<h2 id="the-hidden-cost-of-not-being-able-to-switch-off">The hidden cost
of not being able to switch off</h2>
<p><a
href="https://www.centrica.com/media-centre/news/2022/vampire-devices-cost-households-147-per-year/">According
to energy company Centrica</a>, in 2022 British households were wasting
an average of £147 per year powering devices that could be switched off,
but weren’t. It’s not a king’s ransom, but it’s not pocket change,
either. It’s not that we don’t switch off, but increasingly that we
<em>can’t</em>.</p>
<p>How did we get here?</p>
<p>It seems to me that our present predicament results from two major
technological developments in the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>First, we learned to appreciate the convenience that comes from
having appliances that don’t really turn off. If they don’t turn fully
off, then we can turn them on with remote controls, or have them
operated by a timer. Appliances that don’t turn fully off are quicker to
come to a functional state when we actually need them. Thankfully, the
worse excesses have been eliminated by regulation. We will, I hope,
never again see horrors like the ’80s televisions that consumed 40W in
standby, just keeping their tubes warm, so we wouldn’t miss the first
thirty seconds of <em>Eastenders</em>. In fact the UK, along with many
other regions, now has quite strict regulatory limits on standby power
for some kinds of appliance.</p>
<p>Second, the use of external power supples (EPSs) became commonplace.
An EPS is more commonly known as a mains adapter, wall adapter, or – my
favourite term – ‘wall wart’. These devices connect to a mains outlet,
and produce a lower-voltage DC supply for the appliance.</p>
<p>Manufacturers like EPSs because they make the appliances themselves
cheaper to construct. Appliances don’t have to be constructed to the
same safety standards as they would if they had dangerous mains voltages
internally. The development of switching-mode power supply technology
allows a relatively small EPS to supply quite a large current; so
there’s no longer a need for large, heavy mains transformers to be built
into an appliance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the use of an EPS means that, even if the appliance
actually <em>has</em> an on/off switch that works as it should, the EPS
will still consume a small amount of energy when the appliance is
switched off.</p>
<p>How much? Unfortunately, it’s impossible to generalize in this area.
Manufacturers claim that modern EPSs use ‘negligible’ energy when not
powering anything. But ‘neglible’ here means ‘much lower than when the
appliance is running’. The EPS for my old Lenovo W520 uses about 1 watt
when completely disconnected. It’s neglibible compared to the 100W+ that
the laptop uses when working hard, but it’s not even close to
irrelevant. However, my Samsung USB cellphone chargers draw less than
0.1W (that’s the limit I can measure) when not charging anything. The
energy wastage of a disconnected EPS depends on the design and the
quality of components, which is why we can’t make general
statements.</p>
<p>Of course, we aren’t really interested in the energy usage of a
<em>disconnected</em> EPS, because it will usually be connected to an
appliance that can’t be switched off. These pointless energy-wasters
have become known as ‘vampire’ appliances – they drain a little energy
in the polite way that a vampire bat drains blood: not so much that the
victim notices, but a significant amount over a long period.</p>
<p>Here are some representative power consumption figures for electrical
devices in my own home.</p>

</table>
<p>You’ll notice, perhaps, that the figure “0.5W” appears frequently:
that’s the UK regulatory limit that applies to many kinds of appliance.
I would guess that, taken all together, these electrical vampires do
total to the 40W or so, that would be needed to cost the £147 that
Centrica claims.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note</em> I should point out that I’m not including in this total
the appliances that I really prefer to leave running all the time. These
include my networked printer (4W), network storage (NAS) (2W), cordless
phones, various clocks and things that contain clocks, like the oven,
and so on. I’m only considering things that really should be switched
off, but have no real on/off switch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What seems unforgivable to me is that many of the electrical
appliances that I can’t switch off <em>do</em> actually have a real
on/off switch. For example, my Leak amplifier and CD player, and my
desktop PC, have real on/off switches <em>on the back</em>. It’s not
that the manufacturer is trying to save a pound or two by not having the
switch – it’s there, but in a place I can’t reach. What’s the point of
that?</p>
<h2 id="electrical-safety-issues">Electrical safety issues</h2>
<p>In my lifetime I’ve seen two dramatic failures of electrical
appliances (other than those due to my own carelessness or poor design).
In both cases, the culprit was an EPS. On one occasion, the wall-wart
powering an external disk drive went bang unexpectedly. All the lights
went out, there was a horrible smell of burning, and a puff of smoke;
the disk was damaged beyond repair.</p>
<p>The other event concerned a simple USB phone charger. For no obvious
reason, a tongue of hot sparks shot out of the side of it, through a
hole that had been blown in the casing. This did no great harm – just
some burn marks on the carpet.</p>
<p>It’s a fact of life that electrical devices sometimes fail, sometimes
dramatically. A devices that is switched off – really off – can’t
present a risk of this kind. On balance, if something is going to
explode in my house, I’d rather it happen when there’s somebody around
to deal with it, than when the house is empty.</p>
<p>Both failures I described were of branded items from well-known
suppliers. I don’t know whether the cheap, unbranded items you can buy
from on-line auctions are more or less likely to fail, than the more
expensive ones.</p>
<p>While we are increasingly aware of the energy wastage of devices we
can’t switch off, we don’t seem to consider the safety implications very
often.</p>
<h2 id="putting-it-in-perspective">Putting it in perspective</h2>
<p>In the UK, a typical household is currently paying about £2000 per
year for energy. The amount wasted by leaving electrical appliances on
standby probably amounts to about 10% of that, give or take. I’m not
entirely comfortable with wasting 10% of the energy I use, when there’s
simply no good reason to.</p>
<p>But we can look at this in a different way. My modest car uses about
50kW at cruising speed on a level, straight road. That’s about 1,250
times as much energy as all my vampire appliances waste put together.
Running all these appliances for a year uses the same amount of energy
as driving for seven hours. Another way to think about this is that I
could save this energy by driving for seven minutes less every week.</p>
<p>Or, in fact, I could save it by running my central heating for three
minutes less per week. Yes, that’s per week, not per day. It’s 25
seconds per day.</p>
<p>The reality is that transport and climate control (heating and
cooling) cost most people astronomically more than vampire appliances.
They cost much more even than appliances that typically run all the
time, like smart speakers and video doorbells. Even leaving your XBox in
it’s 14W ‘standby’ mode – as egregious as I consider this behaviour –
still uses a trivial amount of energy, when compared to transport and
climate control.</p>
<p>If you want to save energy – and we all should – there are far better
ways to do it, than to unplug every electrical device we aren’t using.
Of course, if our appliances could actually be switched off, we wouldn’t
have to unplug them.</p>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-example-are-we-setting">What kind of example are we
setting?</h2>
<p>The real problem, it seems to me, in making appliances that can’t be
switched off, is that this quietly ingrains in our society a tolerance
of waste. These appliances send a message that it’s OK to throw away
energy. Ater all, why should I go to any trouble to save electricity,
when designers and vendors of electrical devices – who really ought to
understand the issues – clearly don’t think it matters?</p>
<p>For sure, we could save more energy by doing other things that
switching off. But if the trivial act of switching off is too much
effort, why should we do any of the more difficult things?</p>
<p>Wanting to be the kind of person who sets a good example, I spent the
weekend reorganizing the wiring in my home office – which has 38
electrical outlets – so that a single on/off switches now controls the
supply to everything that doesn’t need to be powered all the time. It’s
a small thing, I know, but I feel better for it.</p>
<p>Does this mean I will walk to the baker’s shop rather than driving,
even when it’s raining?</p>
<p>Probably not, if I’m being honest.</p>
