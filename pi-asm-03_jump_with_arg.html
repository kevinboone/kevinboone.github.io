<h1>ARM assembly-language programming for the Raspberry Pi</h1>
<h2>4. Passing arguments in registers</h2>

<p>
In the previous example, I raised the subject of function calls. I will
introduce a proper function call example shortly, but first we need to
discuss the subject of passing arguments in more detail. I've already
mentioned argument passing in the context of syscalls but, of course,
you're going to want to pass your own arguments to functions you define.
</p>
<p>
Modern practice nearly always favours argument passing by registers.
The other common technique is to use the <i>stack</i> -- an area of
memory  that expands to accommodate data placed in it. We will encounter
the use of the stack for handling command-line arguments -- this is the
way the Linux kernel passes arguments to user programs. However, for 
now, let's stick with registers. 
</p>
<h3>The example</h3>
<p>
In the previous example, we looked at how to create a label 
<code>exit</code>, such that a branch to that label would exit the
program. It's plausible that we might want to exit the program from
multiple points, and it's also conceivable that we might want to 
provide a different exist status code each time. In the previous
example, the status code was embedded in the 'exit' code, but 
here's a slight modification that makes it more flexible.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#990000">//</font> Set exit value to a specific number<font color="#990000">,</font> by jumping to code that
<font color="#990000">//</font>  invokes sys_exit<font color="#990000">.</font> The exit code is passed <b><font color="#0000FF">in</font></b> the r<font color="#993399">0</font> register
<b><font color="#000080">.text</font></b>

<b><font color="#000080">.global</font></b> _start

<font color="#990000">//</font> Exit the program<font color="#990000">.</font>
<font color="#990000">//</font>   On entry<font color="#990000">,</font> r<font color="#993399">0</font> should hold the exit code
<b><font color="#000080">exit:</font></b>
    <b><font color="#0000FF">mov</font></b>    <font color="#990000">%</font>r<font color="#993399">7</font><font color="#990000">,</font> $<font color="#993399">1</font>     <font color="#990000">//</font> sys_exit is syscall #<font color="#993399">1</font>
    swi    $<font color="#993399">0</font>          <font color="#990000">//</font> invoke syscall 

_start<font color="#990000">:</font>
    <b><font color="#0000FF">mov</font></b>    <font color="#990000">%</font>r<font color="#993399">0</font><font color="#990000">,</font> $<font color="#993399">43</font>
    b      exit
</pre>

<p>
The only difference between this example and the previous one is
where the <code>r0</code> register is set. I've defined the exit
code to take a value in the <code>r0</code> register and, as it happens,
that's what the <code>sys_exit</code> syscall expects as well.
So we don't have to do any extra work in the program code.
</p>

<h3>Argument passing</h3>
<p>
It turns out that this use of the <code>r0</code> register is not
arbitrary -- it is defined in the 
<a href="https://github.com/ARM-software/abi-aa/blob/2982a9f3b512a5bfdc9e3fea5d3b298f9165c36b/aapcs32/aapcs32.rst" target="_blank">Procedure call standard for the ARM architecture</a>, which is part of
the Application Binary Interface (ABI). The procedure call standard sets out
how arguments should be passed, for different types of data. Standardization
of this sort makes it easy (well, easier) to build an application from 
components written by different people, using different programming
languages. 
</p>
<p>
If you're working in a high-level language, you don't need to worry
about procedure call conventions or any other part of the ABI -- the
compiler takes care of that. If you're working in assembly you do
have to worry, and not just about procedure calling. There are issues
of <i>alignment</i> as well, which I'll outline later.
</p>
<p>
The procedure call standard for 32-bit ARM devices states that, for
32-bit integer arguments (and this 
includes arguments that are memory addresses)
the first four arguments are placed into registers <code>r0</code> to
<code>r3</code>. If there are more arguments than this, they are 
pushed onto the stack. The Linux kernel does not follow this convention 
for command-line arguments, nor does it fully do so for syscalls.
Syscalls take all their arguments in registers and never use the
stack. Since no syscall takes more than six arguments, and most
take three or fewer, this technicality won't concern us here. 
<p>
</p>
There are other rules in the procedure call standard for
data elements larger than 32-bits, including floating-point
numbers, which I will introduce in due course.
</p>
<h3>A digression about registers</h3>

<p>
Registers are data storage cells within the CPU. The 32-bit ARM CPUs
have sixteen registers, labeled <code>r0</code> to <code>r15</code>. 
In some circumstances these registers can be used in pairs to form
64-bit values. Some of the registers have specific purposes, and
can be referred to in assembly language with more descriptive
names. For example, <code>r13</code> is the <i>stack pointer</i>
(<code>sp</code>) whose crucial role will become apparent
very soon.
</p>
<p>
Both for argument passing and for calculation, using registers is 
much faster than using memory. However, only eleven registers 
are available for general-purpose use -- <code>r0-r8</code> and
<code>r10-r11</code>. Of these, as I've mentioned, the first four
are used for argument passing; but that doesn't preclude them
being used for other things as well, if we're careful.
</p>
<p>
Within a particular function, eleven registers may be sufficient to store
all the working data of that function. If it isn't, the 
function will have to make use of
general memory or the stack, as we'll see.
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Functions are conventionally called with arguments in registers or
on the stack.</p></li>
<li><p><i>The Procedure call standard</i> attempts to ensure interoperability 
between software components by standardizing the use of registers
and the stack, among other things.</p></li>
<li><p>32-bit ARM CPUs have sixteen registers, or which eleven are
general-purpose.</p></li>
