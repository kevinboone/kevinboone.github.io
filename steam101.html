<h1>An introduction to steam locomotive technology</h1>

<img src="img/steam101_tank.jpg" class="article-top-image"><br>

The steam locomotive dominated transport in the western world
for more than a hundred years. It continues to exercise a popular 
fascination that most applications of technology can't match.
Although railway companies and governments in the 1950s and 1960s
sold the public on the idea that steam transport was dirty, noisy,
costly, and inefficient, the reality is that the most modern of the
steamers were superlative examples of the application of engineering
principles, and approached the theoretical maximum efficiency that
could be achieved from burning fuels.
<p></p>
This article explains the fundamental aspects of the design and
operation of a advanced steam loco. The basic principle -- that
boiling water creates high-pressure steam which pushes on pistons
-- is easily stated; the implementation details are much more
complicated, and much more interesting. 
<p></p>
We start with an examination
of the various parts of the machine.  

<h2>Parts of the locomotive</h2>

A huge range of shapes and styles of steam locomotive were built,
but from the very earliest to the very latest they all had the
same basic components. In particular, a locomotive will need a 
firebox, a boiler, a dome, and a smokebox to generate and collect steam,
and manage the exhaust of combustion products.
It will need
cylinders to provide the motive power, connecting rods to couple
the cylinders to the wheels, and valvegear to control the admission of
steam to the cylinders. And, of course, it will need a place for the
crew to stand or sit, and a supply of fuel and water. 
<p></p>

wheels; 10 - non-driven wheels; 11 - connecting rods and valvegear</i>
<p></p>

<h3>The firebox</h3>

The firebox is where the fire is built and maintained.  Most British
steam locos were designed to burn coal, but wood and oil were also
used -- more so in the USA.  As 
well as providing power to drive the locomotive, the steam it generates 
ultimately powers everything else on the train: the brakes, the
carriage heating, the water injectors that fill the boiler when it is
under pressure, the lubrication system, and even the whistle. The fire
can also be used to keep your tea warm and, if you're brave, cook your
dinner.  It is the job of the fireman to keep the fire at the right
height, and to maintain the correct pressure in the boiler. If the
fire gets too low, then there may not be enough pressure in the boiler
to drive the locomotive, especially on hills. If it gets too high,
then the boiler may have to exhaust steam through its safety valves,
which is noisy and inefficient. 

<p></p>

As all the power of the engine ultimately comes from the fire, a
heavy-duty loco will need a significantly larger firebox than smaller
one. The largest fireboxes are found on passenger express trains,
that have to pull a long train at high speeds.

<p></p>

Firebox designs eventually became very sophisticated. The fundamental
design challenge is to allow all the fuel, and the gasses generated,
to combust fully, whilst air is being drawn at high speed through
the fuel mass. 
This has to be done without causing damage to surrounding components,
and without energy being wasted as hot gasses blow out of the
chimney. Many fireboxes have a <i>brick arch</i>, which is exactly
what its name suggests it should be. It's job was to
store and concentrate the heat of the fire, by directing gas flow
in an advantageous way.

<p></p>

A working loco burns a lot of fuel and, if's solid, an awful lot
of ash and clinker is generated. The <i>ashpan</i> is the hopper
under the fire where this material collects. 
The unglamorous jobs of collecting clinker without disturbing
the fire, and emptying the ashpan, were significant engineering
challenges in their own right. 


<h3>The boiler</h3>

The boiler in a steam locomotive is essentially a big water tank
through which run tubes that carry the hot gasses from the fire. 
Because the fire could otherwise be hot enough to melt the firebox
itself,
the water in the boiler usually completely encloses the fire chamber as
well. As the hot gasses run through
the boiler, they give up their heat to the water, which eventually
boils and liberates steam. 
<p></p>
In an open water chamber like an uncovered saucepan, the temperature
of boiling water will not usually exceed water's boiling point of
100 degrees Celsius. Energy added beyond that point has the effect
of liberating more steam, without increasing the pressure of the
steam, or increasing the water temperature. In a locomotive, however, 
the steam liberated by boiling cannot easily escape from
the boiler -- it must do some work first -- so the boiler tends to
run at a higher pressure than the surroundings.
Increasing the water pressure also increases the boiling point, so
more energy of combustion can be stored by raising the temperature
still further. This principle of <i>superheating</i> was exploited
by more modern boiler designs to improve efficiency.
<p></p> 
In the largest
engines, pressures of over 300 psi were common; that's about
ten times the pressure in fully-inflated car tyre. Because the boiler
walls are rigid, there is little for them to do if the pressure gets
too high other than to crack, which would be a Bad Thing. So there
are normally pressure release valves in the top of the boiler
to vent steam safely in the event of over-pressure. An over-pressure
condition is most likely to occur where the fire has been built up
too high for the work the engine is to do. Typically this will 
happen when the locomotive is bought to rest in a station with
the fire still high from the journey. While it does no real harm
to have the boiler blow off steam this way, it is noisy and damp, and
therefore unpleasant for
people nearby. As Gordon warns Thomas the Tank Engine
: ''It isn't wrong, but we just don't do it!''. 
A good fireman is expected to know the route, and
allow the fire to die down sufficiently when coming to an extended
halt. 


<h3>The smokebox</h3>

Hot fumes from the firebox are drawn through the boiler tubes and are
collected in the smokebox, from whence they are exhausted by the
chimney. 

<p></p>

The smokebox commonly contains the <i>superheater tubes</i> and 
the <i>blast pipes</i> (see below). 

<p></p>

Superheater tubes are used to raise the
temperature of the steam coming out of the boiler to above the boiling
temperature of water. This is very difficult to do
simply by heating the water itself 
- and the hotter the steam, the more efficient the locomotive
(do a Web search for 'Carnot cycle' for a detailed explanation why this is).

<p></p>

After heavy use the smokebox tends to accumulate dust and ash, so
the front can usually be swung open for access. The handles on the
front of the smokebox give many locos a distinctive "clock face"
appearance. 

<p></p>
<img src="img/steam101_flow.jpg"><br>
<i>Simplified view of the arrangement of firebox, boiler, and smokebox. 
Note that the firebox and boiler
are continuous, and that the fire chamber is completely surrounded
by water. The hot gasses from the firebox are drawn along metal
tubes in the boiler, eventually to escape through the firebox
and chimney. Air to feed the fire is drawn from the dampers under
the firebox, and through the firebox door in the cab</i>


<h3>Chimney</h3>

The chimney serves as an exhaust for the fumes of combustion;
obviously these fumes have to go somewhere. However, the chimney is more than
just a hole in the top of the firebox, and chimney design was the
subject of a great deal of research. This is because a roaring fire in
the firebox will need a good supply of oxygen for combustion, so the
chimney has to allow a good flow of air through the firebox and boiler
tubes. At the same time, it has to prevent sparks from  
firebox from being swept out of the firebox and causing fires near
the line. Track-side fires were more a problem in North America than
in the permanently damp UK, and many US locomotives had elaborate
spark arrestors in their chimneys.

<p></p>

As well as combustion products, the chimney will also carry away the 
exhaust steam from the cylinders. Exhausting steam from the cylinders
this way is not only convenient, it also improves combustion. This
is because the rush of steam up the chimney draws air up into the
firebox and thus through the fire. This additional flow of air
carries more oxygen to the fire.

<p></p>

This use of the exhaust steam from the cylinders to fan the 
fire is only possible
when the locomotive is moving; when it is stationary no
steam is exhausted and there is therefore no drawing effect. 
So all but the earliest locomotives had <i>blast pipes</i>
whose job was to
direct a jet of steam directly from the boiler up the chimney. Although this
is potentially wasteful of steam, and therefore of energy, 
it does have the effect of drawing a
more forceful stream of air through the firebox, and can be applied
whenever there is steam in the boiler. The valve that
admits steam from the boiler to the blast pipe is called the
<i>blower</i>.  


<h3>The dome</h3>

The dome acts as the collector of steam from the boiler. It provides 
a volume of hot, dry steam away from the water in the boiler itself.
As such it is usually built at, or close to, the highest point
on the boiler. 
The use of a dome reduces the likelihood that water, or water vapour,
will be fed into
the cylinders instead of steam, which would have catastrophic
consequences. Typically the driver's regulator handle (see later) 
operates a valve in the dome, so the driver can control the
amount of steam fed into the cylinders and, therefore, the power
generated by the locomotive. 

<h3>The cylinders</h3>

Hot steam under pressure is fed from the boiler into each 
cylinder, where it pushes a piston which eventually turns
the wheels. The flow of steam into the cylinder is governed
by the <i>steam chest</i>, a valve assembly mounted directly
above the cylinder. The valves can admit steam either behind
the piston, which pushes it forward, or in front of the piston, which 
pushes it back. The ability to apply steam to both sides
of the piston is important because, unlike a car, locos don't have
gearboxes. So the only way to switch a locomotive between forward and
reverse motion is by controlling the times at which steam is injected onto
each side of the piston.

<p></p>

The opening and closing of the valves in the steam chest is controlled
by the motion of the wheels themselves, adjusted by the driver 
by means of the <i>reversing gear</i> in the cab (see below). The
wheel motion is coupled onto the steam chest by means of <i>valvegear</i>.

<p></p>

Although the steam that is admitted to the cylinder is hot and dry,
it very soon cools and, as it cools, water condenses out. Water
is not very compressible, and if enough of it accumulates in the
cylinder it may prevent full piston travel. If full-pressure steam
is admitted to a cylinder whose piston cannot move properly, there
is an excellent chance that this will blow the end of the cylinder
off. So cylinders invariably have either safety valves or drain cocks.
Drain cocks allow water that has condensed to run out, and are
usually operated from the cab by the driver. As most drivers keep
the drain cocks open whenever the train is stationary, you'll see
a blast of steam from the cylinders as the train comes to a halt, 
and another blast of steam when it pulls away. Normal practice is
to keep the drain cocks open for about six wheel revolutions. 


<h3>The steamchest and cylinder</h3>

The valves in the steam chest control the admission of steam
onto the front or back of the piston. However, the steam
chest alone cannot synchronize the valve action to the movement of
the locomotive: this is the job of the valve gear. Typically
the steamchest will either be an integral part of the cylinder
assembly (as in the photo below), or will be mounted close to
the cylinder assembly and coupled to it using thick pipework.
The valves in the steamchest are actuated by a pushrod that
is coupled to the valvegear. By controlling the timing
of the valve movements with respect to the wheel movements, the
locomotive can be driven forward or backwards, and with varying
degrees of effort.
<p></p>
<img src="img/steam101_steamchest.jpg" class="article-image"><br>
<i>
In this photograph, the steamchest cover has been removed, 
showing the steamchest valves. In this example, the steamchest
and the cylinder form a single assembly: you can see the piston itself
at the bottom of the photo. Normally, steam would be admitted
to the top of the steamchest, and the valves would admit it
to either the front or the back of the piston. The opening
and closing of the valves is controlled by the rod that enters
the steamchest just below the cover: as the rod is pushed
back and forward by the valvegear, steam is admitted to either 
side of the piston.
</i>


<h3>The valvegear</h3>

<img src="img/steam101_valvegear.jpg" class="article-image">
The purpose of the valvegear is to open and close the valves in the
steamchest at the appropriate points, with respect to the motion
of the wheels. Like everything else on a
locomotive, the valvegear derives its motive force from the movement
of the piston in the cylinder. The steamchest pushrod typically
requires a full movement of about 4 inches to switch from full forward
pressure on the piston to full reverse pressure. However, the piston
itself may move through several feet during its working cycle. Clearly
the steamchest cannot be directly coupled to the piston. In practice,
some fraction of the piston's motion is coupled to the steamchest
pushrod. That is, for each foot of motion of the piston, the 
steamchest pushrod may move up to an inch. In fact, the amount it
moves, and the direction, will be controlled by the <i>reversing
gear</i> in the cab. For example, when the steamchest pushrod is
moving in the same direction as the piston, the loco is moving
forward. When they are moving in the opposite direction, the loco
is moving backwards. Between these two extremes the loco will
not be powered at all. 
<p></p>
As can be seen from the photo, the system of linkages associated
with the valvegear could be quite complex. The photo shows a
typical 'Walschaerts' configuration, which was popular from about
1860 onwards.


<h3>Connecting rods</h3>

<img src="img/steam101_connrod.jpg" class="article-image">
The pistons move in a reciprocating, front-to-back fashion but
wheels, of course, have to rotate. The connecting rods connect the
pushrods of the pistons to the wheels, with a rotating coupling
at each end. To prevent the piston being subjected to a stressful
bending action, the rotating coupling at the pushrod end takes the
form of a <i>crosshead</i> which slides
back and forth along <i>slidebars</i>. Because of the considerable
stresses involved, all these components are substantial steel
constructions, and need rigorous lubrication. In most cases, 
lubricating oil was dripped continuously onto these components
using pumps.


<h3>The tender</h3>

A large locomotive consumes a good deal of coal and water, and 
it is more efficient if the loco carries its own supplies, rather
than having to stop to refuel and re-water every few miles. Small
engines would carry as much water as could be accommodated in their
tanks, and as much coal as would fit in a hopper behind the cab.
These supplies were not adequate for large locos, so such locos would
typically pull a tender. The tender was nothing more than a
big hopper full of coal and water, towed along behind the engine.

<h2>Types of locomotive</h2>

Steam locomotives can be categorised in a number of ways. A major
distinction for example, is whether the loco has a tank or separate
tender. Whichever it has, a particular loco will have
a specific wheel plan, that is, a certain layout of driven and
non-driven wheels. On engines with tanks, different types and
locations of tank were employed. This section examines
some of the common design patterns that locomotive and railway 
designers have employed. 

<h3>Tank engines and tender engines</h3>

Small locomotives, often used for industrial and shunting duties,
generally carried their own water supply in an on-board tank.
They would frequently carry a supply of coal as well. This was
convenient, and made the locomotive self-contained. Industrial and
shunting engines were seldom very far from a source of coal and 
water, so this arrangement generally worked quite well. However,
most large locomotives -- whether used for passengers or
freight -- had separate tenders. The tender carried water
and coal, and was towed along behind the engine. The use of a tender
considerably increased the range that can be covered between
refuelling stops. However, a tender engine is significantly more
complex to prepare than a tank engine, as the tender itself has to be
prepared, loaded with consumables, and coupled to the engine. Of course, 
tender engines are less self-contained than tank engines. 
Among tank engines,
a number of different tank arrangements were in widespread use,
as will be described later.


<h3>Gauge</h3>

The <i>gauge</i> of the track, and therefore of the locomotive and
train, is the distance between the inner edges of the rails.
In the UK and the USA, 'main line' railways -- railways that
span large distances at high speed -- generally run on a 
gauge of 4' 8" ('standard gauge'). The common story that 
this gauge derives ultimately
from the wheel spacing of Roman chariots is almost certainly
an urban myth. In fact, the 
Romans did not use chariots for transport, either in war or
peace, although they did race them in specially-designed stadiums. 
Chariots were
a Greek idea, and were considered obsolete by the early days of
the Roman empire. In reality, a number of different track gauges
operated side-by-side in the UK when the early railways were
privately owned. 

<p></p>

In contrast to the uniformity of main line gauge -- at least after
the early 'guage wars' -- there was historically far less agreement on a 
standard gauge for industrial locomotives. Frequently these were what would now
be termed 'narrow gauge', that is, two feet or less. Gauges of
18 inches and, occasionally, 12 inches were to be found in quarries 
and mines. Narrow gauge track is less expensive and easier to
lay. However, the height of a locomotive is ultimately limited by
its gauge. A tall loco on narrow rails will be unstable, particularly
when cornering. 


<h3>Wheel plans</h3>

Many small industrial and shunting locomotives have only four or six
wheels, all of which are driven. However, four or six wheels may not
be sufficient for a high-speed passenger locomotive, whether
they are driven or not. If the locomotive is long - and it will be
if it is to house a powerful boiler - then more wheels will be
needed to carry the weight -- making the frame substantial 
enough to carry a heavy boiler with wheels only at the ends
would have led to a very heavy locomotive.
 Where the wheels are merely for load-bearing purposes,
they need not be driven. For wheels to be driven, they must be
coupled onto the drive train in some way, which increases complexity
and expense. However, the more wheels that are driven, the more
traction that can be applied to the track -- steel wheels on a 
steel track do tend to slip under power. Although most locomotives
carried equipment to spray the track with sand and increase 
friction, driving more wheels had the same effect with less wear
on the moving parts.

<p></p>

For a train to achieve high speeds, the driven wheels must be quite
large (see photo below). This is because the wheel rotates exactly
once per stroke of the piston. To achieve high speeds with small
wheels would require very rapid piston strokes, which is inefficient
and prone to excessive wear. Occasionally, loco designers did
experiment with really huge wheels, sometimes ten feet in diameter
or more. The problem with these designs is that the axles of
such wheels will need to be five feet above the track, which is 
where the boiler or firebox ought to be. In practice, only
one such wheel could be driven, which could lead to poor
traction on the rails. Such designs were rarely successful,
and mostly did not catch on.

</table>

So, in general, industrial locos had a small number of wheels, all
driven, while passenger locos had a large number of wheels, some
of which were driven and some - smaller in size - which were not.
It is conventional to describe the wheel plan as three numbers,
written 'A-B-C', where A is the number of leading non-driven
wheels, B the number of driven wheels, and C the number of
trailing non-driven wheels. If the locomotive has only driven
wheels, then 'A' and 'C' are '0'. So, a locomotive with four
driven wheels only would be denoted '0-4-0'. The largest
passenger express locos had wheel arrangements as large
as 4-8-4.

<p></p>



<h3>Tank arrangement</h3>

Conventionally, the tank arrangement is indicated by an abbreviation
after the wheel plan (see below). For example, in the designation
'0-6-0T', the 'T' simply stands for 'tank', and denotes the
standard tank arrangement. The following table describes some of
the most common tank layouts and their abbreviations.

      In the standard tank engine, the tanks are supported by the
engine's chassis, one on each side of the boiler. This construction
was very popular owing to its simplicity. However, it had the effect
of making access to the running gear 
difficult. In addition, heat was lost needlessly from the top of the boiler,
which was somewhat wasteful.

      In the well tank layout, the bulk of the water was carried low
      down between the chassis members. This had the effect of 
      keeping the tank out of the way, but there was frequently not 
      enough room to store sufficient water. Consequently, as the 
      photo shows, well tank engines frequently had auxiliary
      side tanks in addition to the well.

      In the saddle tank layout, the tank 'hangs' from the boiler
like a saddle. This keeps the tank clear of the chassis, while
retaining the same capacity as a standard tank. However, the 
construction of the tank is much more difficult than a standard
tank, and the weight of the water is carried higher on the
locomotive.

<h2>Operating the locomotive</h2>

All but the smallest locomotives were driven by a crew of two: the
driver ('engineer' on some railways) and the fireman. 
On small industrial locos, it was possible
for the same person to play both roles. In general, the job of
driver was considered to be the more prestigious and senior, and
most railway companies had strict career progression rules from 
fireman to driver. Normally a would-be driver would have to serve as
fireman for several years, and take examinations, before being
appointed as a driver. 

<h3>Fireman's duties</h3>

The fireman's main job is to ensure a steady supply of steam at
the appropriate pressure to provide power to the engine. 
This is much more difficult than it sounds. The engine's
steam requirements vary considerably according to the load it is
pulling, and the gradient. The fireman has to predict the 
steam requirements for some distance ahead, and adjust the fire
accordingly. Some of the more important controls on the
fireman's side of the footplate are shown in the image below.

<p></p>
<img src="img/steam101_fireman.gif" class="article-image"><br>
<i>
Controls on the fireman's side of the footplate. Not visible in
the photo, because they are down by the floor, are the injectors and
damper control (see text for details). The small platform above
the firebox door is the warming tray, used for keeping lubricating
oil liquified, and for keeping the crew's tea warm
</i>
<p></p>

In order to provide steam, there must be sufficient water in the
boiler. When the engine is cold, the boiler can be filled with
water at ordinary pressure. However, when the engine is running
the boiler will be under considerable pressure. To fill the boiler
requires the use of <i>injectors</i>. Injectors utilize the 
energy generated by the sudden contraction of cooling steam to
drive water into the boiler against its pressure. To power the
injectors a supply of steam is required. Larger engines had two types
of injectors: live steam, and exhaust steam, injectors. A live steam
injector was powered by steam from the boiler itself, while an
exhaust steam inector is power by steam exhausted from the pistons.
Exhaust steam injectors are more economical to run, but do not
work when the locomotive is standing still (because there is
no exhaust steam).

<p></p>

The water level in the boiler must always be kept within 
well-defined limits. If there is too much water, there will not
be space for the steam to develop. If too little, there is
a risk that the firebox crown (i.e., the top) would recieve 
insufficient cooling, and melt. To determine the water level, the
fireman uses a <i>sight glass</i> mounted on the back of the
boiler and connected directly to it. His aim is to keep the
water level visible in the sight glass. Water will be consumed more
rapidly when the loco is working hard.

<p></p>

The fireman must also ensure that the steam pressure in the boiler
is maintained within working limits. This is done by adjusting
the height of the fire. To raise the fire, the fireman can
add more coal (up to a point), and/or increase the flow of
air through the firebed. Air can be drawn in through the firebox
door, which is also used for loading the firebox with coal.
When the firebox door is open, a greater volume of air can
be drawn through the fire, increasing combustion. Most locos
also have an adjustable <i>damper</i> which regulates air
intake through the front of the firebox. Using the coal 
depth, firebox door, and damper, the fireman adjusts 
the rate of combustion in accordance with the required 
steam pressure. When the loco is moving, airflow through the
fire can be much greater than when it is stationary. In addition,
airflow will vary according to whether the loco is running
forwards ('chimney first') or backwards ('cab first'). 
If a greater airflow is required when the loco is stationary
(when building up steam at a station, for example), the <i>blower</i>
can be opened (see below).

<p></p>

Part of the fireman's skill is to be able to anticipate changes to
steam requirements, and adjust the fire height in advance. 
It takes some time for pressure to raise, even with the fire
roaring, so steam cannot be generated on demand. It can be
embarrassing to run out of steam half-way up a hill.



<h3>Driver's duties</h3>

The driver is responsible for controlling the speed and direction
of the locomotive. This control is achieved using the regulator,
reversing gear, and brake.

<p></p>
<img src="img/steam101_driver.gif" class="article-image"<br>
<i>
Controls on the driver's side of the footplate. Not visible in
the photo, because they are down by the floor, are the rail sanding
gear and cylinder drain cocks
(see text for details)
</i>
<p></p>

The <i>regulator</i> is the 'throttle' of the locomotive; it controls
the delivery of steam from the boiler into the cylinders. With the
regulator fully open, a high volume of steam is admitted, and maximum
power may be generated. However, the cylinder power is influenced by
the <i>reversing gear</i>. This control adjusts the proportion of
the piston stroke for which the steam valves are open into the
piston. It also controls whether steam is admitted in front or behind
the piston, thus controlling the direction of travel.
For maximum power, the regulator needs to be fully open and
the reversing gear fully forward or fully reversed. In practice,
both the reversing gear and the regulator contribute to the power
generated by the piston, and thus to the speed of the locomotive.

If the regulator is closed, the loco will gradually come to a halt. 
However, all locos will have additional braking capacity, provided
either by mechanical or vacuum brakes, or both. Passenger locos
mostly used vacuum brakes, with the coaches and the engine on the
same vacuum circuit. A vacuum brake was released (that is, not
braking) by holding the braking system at a vacuum. If the vacuum
was destroyed (by admitting air to the system), the brakes are
applied. This system offers significant safety advantages over
mechanical or pressure operated brakes. In particular, if a leak
develops in the system, it will tend to stop the train. In addition,
if part of the train becomes decoupled, the rush of air into
the brake hoses will immediately apply the brakes on both parts
of the train. 

<p></p>

As well as controlling the speed and direction, the driver has
numerous other controls to be concerned with. The <i>drain cocks</i>
allow condensation to be drained from the cylinders. Typically
the drain cocks are opened whenever the loco comes to a stop, and
remain open for the first few yards of motion. Water is not
particularly compressible, and if it condenses in the cylinders,
the motion of the piston will probably cause considerable damage.

<p></p>

The driver also has controls to deposit sand on the rails. This
improves traction between the wheels and the rails, particularly
on hills. The <i>blower</i> allows steam from the boiler to blast
directly up the chimney. Although this is wasteful of steam, it
has the effect of drawing a strong stream of air through the fire,
increasing its combustion rate. The blower is particularly important
in tunnels, to counter the back-pressure caused by the sudden 
obstruction of free flow from the chimney. In some cases this
back-pressure could be large enough to 'lift' the fire, that is,
raise it from the firebed. If the firebox door was open, there
could be a flashback onto the footplate, with catastrophic results.
