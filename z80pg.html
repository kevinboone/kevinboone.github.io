<h1>A self-contained CP/M computer based on the Z80 Playground</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/z80.jpg" 
  alt="z80 logo"/>
  I've recently rediscovered the joys of programming for CP/M, using a
  <a href="http://8bitstack.co.uk/" target="_blank">Z80 Playground</a> 
  single-board computer. Like most contemporary Z80 boards, the Z80-PG has no 
  provision for a display or keyboard device -- it has an
  FTDI-style 5V RS232 serial port, and expects to be plugged into
  a terminal emulator.
  In a <a href="pi_zero_terminal.html">previous article</a> 
  I described
  how to use a Raspberry Pi Zero as a serial terminal with an HDMI
  video output and USB keyboard port, and a cheap
  USB-serial converter. In this article I describe how
  to build the whole thing into a case, to create a self-contained
  Z80-based CP/M microcomputer. I'm not suggesting that my approach is
  the only one; in fact, it's not even particularly optimal. However, 
  it requires no fine soldering, which is a big deal with my
  ageing eyesight.
</p>
<p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>I do not know the current state of the Z80 Playground project, and the small community around it seems to have disbanded. However, this article is broadly applicable to other small retrocomputers that have a serial terminal as their primary I/O device, like the Z80-MBC2 and RC2014.</blockquote>

<p>
I wanted a self-contained unit that a small HDMI monitor would sit atop. 
There are many ABS plastic cases which are suitable for the job, but I 
chose one that has a transparent top: the Z80-PG
has a number of useful indicator LEDs, that I thought would be
nice to see blinking. It would, of course,
be more elegant to bring the LEDs to the front panel, but that would
require fine soldering onto the Z80-PG board -- something I can no 
longer manage. Being able to see the LEDs through the transparent lid
of the case
is only slightly useful, as the case will usually have a monitor on top.
But slightly useful is better than not useful at all. 
</p>

<p>
The case I selected has 230mm x 150mm x 87mm outside dimensions. I got
it from an electrical retailer, and I presume that the vendor did not
have retrocomputing applications in mind. This case is 
<i>just</i> big enough to fit all the components and the cabling, 
as you can see 
in the photo below. The Z80-PG is only about 100mm x 100mm, but I 
needed to be able to connect two USB extension cables to it, 
on different sides of
the board, and these cables
do not bend very tightly -- nor does an HDMI cable. In fact, this
is the second case I bought for this project -- the first one turned
out to be way too small to fit all the cables in, even 
the components themselves fit well enough.
</p>

</p>

<p>
There are two USB ports on the front of the case -- one is for a USB
keyboard, which goes to the Pi Zero, and the other 
is an extension for the Z80-PG's USB flash
socket. The Z80-PG would still work
if this socket were not extended outside the case, but there's no other
way to exchange software and data with the outside world, except to
copy it to and from the storage.
The use of USB storage for emulating the floppy drives sets the Z80
Playground apart from the Z80-MBC2 or the RC2014: these both use memory
cards for storage. These cards could be extended to the front panel, but not
as easily as a USB port can.
</p>

<p>
Another (internal) USB cable runs from the Z80-PG to the Pi Zero -- that's the
serial interface. I had to buy a right-angle adapter for this USB port, 
so the USB cable did not have to be bent through a tight radius.
</p>

<p>
The Pi Zero has an HDMI cable to the rear panel, which connects to the
monitor. Also on the rear panel are the 12V power socket. I decided to
power the unit from 12V, even though both the Pi Zero and the Z80-PG
run on 5V. This allowed me to use the same 12V power supply for the
computer and the monitor,
reducing the need for transformers and their associated wiring on
the desktop. Moreover, a 12V supply is better for the Raspberry Pi than
the traditional USB charger, for reasons I explain in
<a href="rpi_undervoltage.html">this article</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, the Pi won't run directly from a 12V supply -- a step-down
converter is needed. 
The power supply and converter wiring is the only part of the design 
that needed
soldering -- all the other connections are made using pre-assembled
cables. 
</p>

<p>
I drilled a mesh of small ventilation holes in the back and sides of
the case, although none of the electrical parts runs hot, and I don't
really know whether this ventilation is necessary. 
</p>

<p>
The photo below shows the unit in use with a monitor. These 10-inch
HDMI monitors cost next to nothing, and sit nicely on top of the 
case, while still allowing the various indicator LEDs to be 
visible.

<p>
Ah... WordStar. There's really nothing like it. For better or worse.
</p>


<p>
Apart from the fact that the USB flash drive is about a gazillion times
faster than an 8" floppy, it's just like using a real CP/M machine
from the early 80s.
