<h1>Using an I2C analog-to-digital for temperature measurement on the Raspberry Pi</h1>

<p>
<img src="img/chip.png" alt="Chip symbol" class="article-top-image"/>
In my article on <a href="adc.html">using an I<sup>2</sup>C ADC with the
Raspberry Pi</a> I described in detail how to use the Texas Instruments
ADS7830 with the Pi's I<sup>2</sup>C interface. I explained how to
use the ADC chip in a circuit, and how to write C code to 
read the analog values, without using any opaque libraries or tools.
</p>
<p>
In this article I explain how to use the ADC set-up from
the previous one for a simple
application -- measuring temperature with a thermistor. I'll 
describe how to calculate the temperature from the values read
by the ADC chip, and some of the sources of error you're
likely to encounter. There's a bit of algebra, because I like
to explain things thoroughly. However, you don't need to be able
to follow the calculations -- or even care about them -- to make
sense of the simple C program I provide.  
</p>
<p>
If you don't know anything about using I<sup>2</sup>C ADCs with
the Raspberry Pi, I'd suggest reading my introductory article
first.
</p>

<h2>About thermistors</h2>
<p>
Most materials have an electrical resistance that varies with 
temperature, but a thermistor is designed to have a particularly
striking temperature response. Where a sample of metal may vary its resistance
by a tiny fraction of one percent for a temperature change of
one degree Celsius, a thermistor's value might change by 5% or
more for the same temperature change.
</p>
<p>
Thermistors are available with <i>positive temperature coefficient (PTC)</i>
and <i>negative temperature coefficient (NTC)</i>. A PTC thermistor
shows an increase in resistance with temperature, and I'll bet you can
work out what an NTC thermistor does. 
</p>
<p>
The relationship between the resistance of a thermistor and the
temperature is an exponential one -- I'll give the
mathematical details later, because we'll need them to write the
program.
</p>
<p>
The behaviour of a thermistor is described using three parameters:
the <i>nominal resistance</i>, the <i>base temperature</i>, and
the <i>temperature coefficient</i>. The nominal resistance, which 
I'll denote by <i>R<sub>0</code></i>, is the resistance that the
thermistor has at the base temperature, which I'll call
<i>T<sub>0</sub></i>. The temperature coefficient is a measure of
how rapidly the resistance changes with temperature; this is nearly 
always represented using the symbol &beta;.
</p>
<p>
In the circuit I'll show later, I use the MF52-103 NTC thermistor, 
which has &beta;=3950, and a nominal resistance of 10 kilohms at
25 Celsius. This device is available in a range of tolerances,
from 1% upwards. Obviously, the closer-tolerance parts will give
more accurate results without calibration, but are more expensive; 
but there are other
sources of error that might make calibration preferable to 
expensive parts -- more on this below. 
</p>
<p>
Physically, a thermistor is an unprepossessing plastic bead, which 
might as small as a pin-head. The MF52 is about 3mm across, and
costs about 50p for the closest-tolerance variety. 
</p>

<h2>The circuit</h2>

<p>
The simple circuit of the thermistor and the ADC chip is shown 
below.
<p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/adc_thermistor.png" alt="circuit diagram" width="720px"/>
</p>

<p>
The thermistor and a 10k resistor form a voltage divider, such that
the value measured by the ADC, <i>V<sub>ADC</sub></i>, will be
half the supply voltage <i>V<sub>S</sub></i> at 25 degrees 
Celsius. Or, at least, very close -- see below. Using a
fixed resistor with the same value as the thermistor's nominal
value makes the arithmetic for calculating the temperature
a lot easier. However, the value of the fixed resistance isn't
critical, if you're prepared to adjust the math. 
</p>
<p>
What <i>is</i> critical is that we know the value that will be
read by the ADC when <i>V<sub>S</sub></i> =  <i>V<sub>ADC</sub></i>.
For maximum precision, we'd like that to be the maximum ADC
value -- 255 with an 8-bit converter. The  
ADS7830 has a built-in voltage reference that could be used to supply
the potential divider, rather than using the supply voltage. 
However, fluctuations in the supply voltage don't seem to affect the
value read by the ADC chip -- presumably the voltages on its internal
measurement circuitry all fluctuate by the same amount. 
</p>

<p>
You may not need the pull-up resistors shown in the circuit diagram,
as recent Pi models have these built in, and enabled by default.
</p>
<p>
It should be obvious, but the thermistor should be located where you
want to measure the temperature, and away from any unwanted heat
sources. The ADC chip itself doesn't generate any detectable heat, 
but the Raspberry Pi board does. If you're measuring outdoor 
temperature, the thermistor needs to be out of air currents, or
it'll be measuring wind chill. If it's in an air-tight enclosure, 
it will respond only slowly to temperature changes, but that may
not be a problem if you're measuring ambient temperature.
</p>


<h2>Calculating the temperature from the ADC reading</h2>

<p>The program will need to convert the value read from the
ADC -- which will be a number in the range 0-255 -- into
a temperature. To do this conversion we will need
to make use of the mathematical
relationship between the thermistor's temperature and resistance.  
</p>
<p>
The thermistor has a resistance <i>R<sub>T</sub></i> 
at some temperature <i>T</i> that is determined by the following
expression:
</p>

<p>
$$ R_T = R_o e^{\beta (\frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T_o})}, $$
</p>

<p>
where <i>R<sub>0</sub></i> is the nominal resistance of the 
thermistor at base temperature <i>T<sub>0</sub></i>. 
For the device I've chosen,
<i>R<sub>0</sub></i> is 10k ohms at <i>T<sub>0</sub></i> 25 Celsius.
It's important to remember that, in the expression for <i>R<sub>0</sub></i>,
<i>all temperatures are in absolute (Kelvin) values</i>, which are
273.15 degrees larger than Celsius temperatures. 
</p>

<p>
For tidiness, let
</p>

<p>
$$ Q = \frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T_o}, $$
</p>

<p>
so
</p>

<p>
$$ R_T = R_o e^{\beta Q}. $$
</p>

<p>
<i>Q</i> is, essentially, what we need to find: if we know <i>Q</i>, it's
easy to find <i>T</i>. 
</p>

<p>
For the voltage divider shown in the circuit diagram: 
</p>

<p>
$$ V_{adc} = V_s \frac {10000} {R_T + 10000}. $$
</p>

<p>
For convenience, let
</p>

<p>
$$ V_{adc} / V_s = P. $$
</p>

<p>
<i>P</i> will be determined directly from values taken from the ADC
-- it is a measurement, that we will use to find <i>Q</i> and,
hence, the temperature. So
</p>

<p>
$$ P = \frac {10000}{R_T + 10000}. $$
</p>

<p>
Substituting for <i>R<sub>T</sub></i> and expanding, we get
</p>

<p>
$$ P R_0 e^{\beta Q} + 10000 P = 10000. $$
</p>

<p>
But, in fact, <i>R<sub>0</sub></i> is 10k, because we chose it that
way, so
</p>

<p>
$$ P e^{\beta Q} + P = 1. $$
<p>

<p>
With a bit of algebra we get
</p>

<p>
$$ Q = \frac{1}{\beta} log (\frac {1-P}{P}). $$
</p>

<p>
Substituting the value of <i>Q</i> we had earlier, we end up with <i>T</i>,
the temperature, in terms of things we know or can measure:
</p>

<p>
$$ T = \frac {1}{log(\frac{1-P}{P}) / \beta + \frac{1}{T_0}}. $$
<p>

<p>
Remember that <i>P</i> is just the faction of the maximum value seen by
the ADC -- typically the value read, divided by 255. We know this, so
we can work out <i>T</i>.
<p>
<p>
Here is the relevant section of code, that calculates the temperature
based on the ADC reading.

<p>
There's a bit of additional complexity in the code, because it
produce a result in degrees Celsius, rather than absolute 
temperature.
</p>

<h2>How well does this circuit work?</h2>
<p>
The main source of error in the calculated temperature follows from the
uncertainties in the properties of the thermistor and the fixed
resistor. Not only will these uncertainties directly bias the measurements,
but they will invalidate the mathematical analysis, which relies on
the resistances being equal. Of course, you can always re-work the 
arithmetic without assuming equal resistances. It isn't difficult,
but you'll need a large sheet of paper to write out the final result.  
</p>
<p>
Using 1% tolerance parts for both components, 
it's probably fair to say that the 
uncertainty in the final calculated temperature will be <i>at least</i>
2%; but the exponential nature of the arithmetic makes it hard to
come to general conclusions. My experience is that the simple circuit,
with careful assembly using close-tolerance parts, gives readings
that are in broad general agreement with other domestic thermometers --
even without calibration --
but I doubt it would stand comparison with laboratory equipment.   
</p>
<p>
For accurate results, you'll need to calibrate the circuit, such that
the thermistor and the fixed resistor have equal resistance at
the base temperature. It actually doesn't matter much what the resistances
are, so long as the values are equal. 
</p>
<p>
One way to build calibration into the circuit is to replace the 10k 
fixed resistor with a series
combination of an 8k2 resistor and a 2k2 precision trimmer. You 
could warm the circuit to the base temperature (usually 25 Celsius),
and then adjust the trimmer so that the voltage at the input
to the ADC is exactly half the supply voltage. Alternatively, at
any stable temperature, adjust the trimmer so that the calculated 
temperature matches the value reported by a lab thermometer. The calibration
will hold for other temperatures, within the tolerance of the
temperature coefficient of the thermistor.
</p>
<p>
For lab-grade accuracy, you'll need to measure the ADC value at a
range of stable temperatures, using a thermally-controlled bath, 
and construct a lookup-table. Such a process is beyond the scope of
this article.
</p>
<p>
Whether any of these calibration steps are needed, of course, 
depends on the 
application. It's important to understand that, however carefully you
calibrate, a simple circuit like the one presented here isn't going
to be as accurate as a laboratory instrument. There are all sorts of
sources of error -- temperature-related resistance fluctuations in the
fixed resistor, the limited intrinsic accuracy of a cheap ADC chip,
self-heating of the thermistor, the non-infinite input resistance
of the ADC, to name just a few. Stepwise calibration at a range
of different temperatures will fix all these errors; but if you
have the expertise and equipment for such a task, and  need for it,
 why are you measuring
temperature using a Rasperry Pi? 
</p>
<p>
Still, for applications like fan control, weather  
monitoring, and central heating control, even the simple circuit might
well be accurate enough for practical purposes.
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
An I<sup>2</sup>C ADC and a thermistor provide a simple, low-cost way to
add temperature measurement to the Raspberry Pi or similar device.
The total cost of parts is only a few pounds, and accuracies 
are comparable with ordinary domestic thermometers. You probably 
wouldn't want to use this technique for medical or
laboratory work.
