out: the Chinese domain registration scam is getting slicker</h1>
<p><img src="img/web.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>Scams involving the registration of Internet domain names in China
have come and gone over the last ten years or so. The scammers probably
target the email contacts of registered DNS names – this information is
usually publicly visible.</p>
<p>What typically happens is that the victim receives an email that
purports to be from a Chinese domain name registrar. The email says that
some company has applied to register a <code>.cn</code> domain whose
name matches some part of the victim’s domain name. In my case, the
email said that a Chinese company wanted to register the domain
<code>kevinboone.cn</code>. There isn’t the slightest reason why any
company would want to do this, and I don’t care if one does; but I can
see why the owners of businesses might pay attention to this kind of
warning.</p>
<p>If the victim expresses concern, the scammer offers to register the
victim’s domain name in China, giving him preference over the alleged
original applicant. If the victim accepts such an offer, the scammer
will ask for money to effect the registration. Usually, the price is
ludicrously high: hundreds or thousand of dollars. Registering a
<code>.cn</code> domain through a legitimate registrar only costs about
$10. The scammer generally takes the money and does nothing more.</p>
<p>For many years, these scams were pretty transparent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually the scammers’ emails used terrible English, full of spelling
and grammar mistakes.</li>
<li>The email address of the sender clearly wasn’t a proper business –
it would be something like <code>reg_cn@gmail.com</code>.</li>
<li>The email usually asked for a money transfer, rather than directing
the reader to a legitimate payment service.</li>
<li>If the email referred to a website, the URL of the site was clearly
that of some free web host.</li>
</ul>
<p>But things have moved on. Here is one of the emails I received
recently.</p>
<p><img src="img/mike_zhang.png" class="regular-inline-image" /></p>
<p>First, and most obviously, the email address is not a generic GMail
one: it has a real domain (<code>domainregistry.org.cn</code>). I was
able to carry on an email conversation with
<code>mike@domainregistry.org.cn</code>, whoever he really is.</p>
<p>“Mike Zhang” addresses me by my real name, not
<code>Dear domain owner</code> or <code>Dear CEO</code>, as we used to
see. I certainly got the impression that I was dealing with a real
person, not a computer.</p>
<p>The English of the email is not perfect, but it’s as good as the
English of most Chinese folks I deal with professionally (and a million
times better than my Chinese).</p>
<p>Most problematically, there really is a website at
<code>domainregistry.org.cn</code>, and it looks very slick – like the
site of any real Internet service provider. For all I know, it might
provide real services. Of course, I’m not going to send money just to
find out.</p>
<p>It continues to blow my mind that so many scams are so transparently
obvious. When I answer the telephone, to hear a robotic voice tell me
“this is bank secure department”, I have to laugh. Surely nobody would
fall for that? I guess people do, though, in the same way that some
people still fall for the ‘Nigerian prince’ scam, even after all these
years.</p>
<p>But with this latest round of Chinese domain name scams, well, I
don’t think there’s any shame in being caught out. They’re that good. I
wasn’t fooled, because I’d seen the scam before and, in any case, I
don’t care who uses my domain name. But I can see how a small business,
particular one that was considering doing business in China, would be
taken in, and couldn’t really be blamed.</p>
<p>In a way, I have to respect the scammers. They’ve clearly worked hard
to make the scam as convincing as it is. In fact, I can’t help wondering
whether people who have the skills to do this, might make more money
from legitimate employment?</p>
