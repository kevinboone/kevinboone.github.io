<h1>Creating an "animated score" for demonstrating musical compositions on YouTube, etc</h1>

<img class="article-top-image" src="img/notes.png" 
  alt="musical notes"/>
It has become quite common to show animated musical scores on
YouTube and similar platforms. These allow a viewer to see the music
score, whilst listening to the music. Watching an animated score is
an effective way to begin to learn to perform a piece of music, and
composers often use them to showcase their work. 
<p/>
<p>
Here is an example of how a score might be rendered in YouTube
(there is a link to the real thing below).
<p/>
<p>

</p>
<p>
In this article, I explain one way to create such an animated score,
suitable for uploading to YouTube, using OpenShot and other Linux
tools. I recognize, however, that you might prefer to use something
other than Linux (gasp!) to edit the score itself. I use Sibelius 
for this -- there are Linux score editors, but I've never found any
of them as productive as Sibelius. Your mileage may vary, of course.
</p>
<p>
The basic principle is to turn the printable score into a set
of images, that can be lined up alongside an audio recording
in a video editor. Sibelius outputs printable scores in PDF
format -- I imagine that most most similar products
do. If your score editor can output a set of image files, one
per page, then that's most of the problem solved already.
</p>
<p>
Before starting, you'll need to be aware of the requirements of
the particular video sharing platform you use. As I understand it, YouTube
favours MP4 files with H.264 video encoding and AAC audio encoding. 
There is some flexibility
about the resolution and aspect ratio, but most content producers
favour the standard HD resolutions of 720p and 1080p. OpenShot, like
most video editors, can easily be configured to output these formats.  
In the following explanation, I assume a 720p resolution at 24 frames
per second. 
</p>

<h2>Step 1 -- create a suitably-sized PDF of the score</h2>
<p>
I suspect that most people who compose music, and produce a
printable score, do not do so with YouTube in mind. Sibelius
defaults to producing an A4-sized, portrait-orientation
 printed score, and sets itself
up with that in mind. Apart from the issues of resolution (displayed 
sizes of note-heads, text, etc), no portrait orientation will work
well as a YouTube video.  
</p>
<p>
I find that if I set Sibelius up to use an A5, landscape printed
score, the resulting resolution and aspect ratio works reasonably well 
with YouTube. A5 does not have the same aspect ratio of any of the
common video formats -- it's about 1.42, rather than 16/9. This means
that an A5 rendering will be a little less wide than a standard
format. The video editor will fill the extra width with something
-- usually just black, but this can be configured. 
</p>
<p>
Why not use A4 landscape, if it's the orientation that's the problem?
Score editors like Sibelius are set up to assume they're creating a
printed page, that has to be readable at a particular distance. Choosing
A4, even landscape, will lead to too much detail (too many staves and
notes) to be comfortable on a screen. You should bear in mind that people might watch your video on a cellphone,
so packing too much detail into each page is likely to be counterproductive.
However, if you're
showing a score with many parts -- a chamber orchestra, perhaps --
you might have to live with it. 
In any event, some experimentation with
the document size will likely be necessary, to get the best results,
particularly if you can't predict the viewer's screen size.
</p>

<h2>Step 2 -- split the PDF scre into a number of individual PNG images</h2>
<p>
The nicest way I've found to do this is to use <code>pdftoppm</code>:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ pdftoppm -png scale-to-y 720 -scale-to-x -1 langley_hill_blues.pdf foo
</pre>

<p>
This will split the PDF into files <code>foo-01.png</code>, 
<code>foo-02.png</code>, etc. "foo" is a lazy choice for a filename,
but these files are ephemeral -- they don't need to
be stored because they can be created from the PDF at any time.
</p>
<p>
Since I'm aiming to produce a 720p video file, I've set <code>pdftoppm</code> to output a file that is 720 pixels tall, and with a width that is
compatible with the original aspect ratio. I don't want to stretch
or otherwise distort the image. Because A5 aspect ratio is not the
same as 720p, I end up with images whose sizes are  
1022 x 720 pixels. That leaves 29 pixels on each side of the image
that contain no data. The video editor will quietly fill these in.
</p>
<p>
Will the video editor not scale the images to fit 720p on its own?
It will, but there are two reasons not to let it. First, using
<code>pdftoppm</code> without setting a size will result in its defaults
being used. While these are reasonable if they result in the video
editor scaling the image <i>down</i> to fit the screen, the
results will be very ugly if the images have to be scaled <i>up</i>. 
</p>
<p>
More subtly, the generation of the PNG image from the PDF is itself
a scaling operation, because PDF text is a vector (line) drawing, not
a bitmap raster. If you let the video editor scale the image, the
result will be that it gets scaled <i>twice</i>, with a concommittant
loss of quality. All in all, it's better to get the scaling right
at the point when the PDF is converted to PNG, where you can control
it, and there will be no loss of fine detail.
</p>

<h2>Step 3 -- obtain and prepare the audio</h2>

<p>
I can't really comment on the first part of this: 
you might perform the music yourself, or use
somebody else's recording, with due regard to intellectual property
rules, of course. YouTube is often able to detect, and reject, 
copyright-infringing soundtracks. 
</p>
<p>
YouTube recommends that uploaded videos contain 
audio tracks with at least
128 kbits/sec bitrate. 
</p>
<p>
For best audio quality, you should use an audio recording format
that does not need to be converted -- AAC in the case of YouTube.
OpenShot will output AAC audio when configured to use one of the
standard "HD" video profiles (see below). So supplying an AAC
audio file will result in fewer conversions and probably a slightly
better audio quality. In practice, if you have only an MP3
recording, the built-in conversion done by OpenShot is probably 
acceptable --
the viewer is probably not going to be listening to your audio
on a top-notch hi-fi system. 
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, I've found that OpenShot does not do very well when asked
to handle <i>uncompressed</i> audio (e.g., WAV files). 
I guess the sheer volume
of data just overwhelms it. It works better (for me) if I convert such 
files to AAC
first using, for example, <code>ffmpeg</code>.  
</p>

<h2>Step 4 -- create opening and closing titles if required</h2>

<p>
You might want to show titles or credits, before or after the
music. This can be done, for example, using Gimp. To avoid
unnecessary scaling, try to make the title images the same size
as the individual pages of music, and matching the video format. 
Again, OpenShot can adjust automatically, but you're likely to 
get slightly better image quality if you take charge of it.
</p>


<h2>Step 5 -- edit using OpenShot</h2>

<p>
OpenShot, with all its myriad dependencies, is a huge install -- more
than a gigabyte. It's in the repositories for many popular Linux
distributions; for Ubuntu, you should be able to install it simply
using <code>apt-get openshot</code>. 
</p>
<p>
Binaries for Fedora/RHEL are available from 
<a target="_blank" href="https://rpmfusion.org/">RPM Fusion</a>.
</p>
<p>
Although OpenShot is a very sophisticated piece of software, for
this application its operation is almost trivial.
First, import the music file and drop it into one of the tracks. 
Then place the various image files, in the right order, on one
of the other tracks. The image file markers can be moved and stretched 
on the track, so
that they each start at the right point in the music. 
</p>
<p>
This timing adjustment is really the only slightly tricky part of the
process, and getting it spot-on is necessary, if you want to get
professional-looking results. You can disguise inaccuracies in this
area by allowing the images to overlap, so that the video fades from
one to the next. However, I think a clean cut from one image to the 
next, between the exact two notes if possible, looks better. 
</p>
<p>
It's probably advisable to have fade-in and fade-out transitions at the
beginning and end of the video, rather than having an abrupt start and
end, but this is a matter of taste.
</p>
<p>
Here's what OpenShot looks like for my example, with the various images
and the audio track imported.
</p>

</p>

<h2>Step 6 -- export from OpenShot</h2>

<p>
The "Export video" feature provides a number of preset configurations, or
you can tune the individual settings if you know how, and have a lot of
patience.
</p>
<p>
I find that the preset target "MP4 H.264" with profile "HD 720p 24fps",
works well for YouTube, although I'm sure there are alternatives. 
This produces a file whose size is about 10Mb for each minute of music;
this is much larger than it really needs to be, given that the video
frame-rate might actually only be a few frames per minute. However, 
in the end, I'm not paying for YouTube's storage, and this is the
format they recommend.
