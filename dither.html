<h1>Is dithering necessary when reducing the number of bits per sample in an audio waveform?</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/notes.gif" alt="musical notes"/>
A situation that often arises in digital audio production is the reduction of
the number of bits per sample. Conventionally, audio CDs offer sixteen
bits per sample, but digital audio workstations usually work with
higher precision than this -- typically 24 or 32 bits. This extra 
precision is needed to avoid arithmetic errors in mixing but, in addition,
some musical instruments (mostly electronic ones) 
offer greater than 16-bit precision to
start with.
</p>

<p>
In a more domestic setting, it is sometimes necessary to reduce a
24-bit audio file to 16 bits, for burning to a CD, or playing on
a media player that has only a 16-bit DAC.
</p>

<p>
On the face of it, this doesn't seem to be a problem -- if we
want to convert 24-bit audio data to 16-bit, we can just
discard the bottom (least significant) eight bits of each 
sample. Or, to be more
mathematically robust, we can round each 24-bit sample to the nearest 
16-bit sample. 
</p>

<p>
For reasons that I will attempt to demonstrate, a straightforward
rounding like this introduces errors that are audible
-- if they are audible at all -- as distortion. So the question arises whether
these errors can be reduced or, at least, made less audible.
</p>

<h2>Bit-depth reduction and distortion</h2>

<p>
In order to answer this question, we must first understand why 
reducing the bit-rate creates distortion in the first place. I should
point out that bit-rate reduction will potentially create a problem
whether it is done deliberately as part of audio engineering, or
implicitly, when using a digital-to-analogue converter that has a 
smaller bit width that then sample data.
</p>

<p>
Consider the following data, which shows a single cycle of a sinewave.
The first column, <i>Theta</i> is the angle from 0 to 350 degrees 
(I'm using angle, not time, because this is not a sinewave of 
any particular frequency).
</p>

<p>
The second column, <i>V</i>, shows the amplitude of the sinewave, 
between -1.0000 and
1.0000. This amplitude is shown to five significant figures. The 
third column shows the sample amplitude, <i>V</i>, but rounded to
two significant figures. This rounding is "correct", in that the least-significant
digit is rounded up if the following digit is 5-9, and down if it
is 0-4.

The fourth column shows the difference between the "true" (five-figure)
sample, and the rounded two-figure sample. Note that the error
figure is often zero, and its magnitude is never greater than 0.005.
</p>

<p>
The picture below shows this data graphically. The top trace is
the original sinewave; the lower shows the error at each point on the sinewave. 
These traces are, of course, not to scale -- the error is at most
5% of the maximum amplitude in this example.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/dither0.png" width="650px" alt="Graph of sinewave and error"/>
</p>

<p>
The error signal looks like "noise" here, but it isn't -- not really. That's
because the same error signal will repeat identically in every cycle
of the original waveform. The error can be seen as
 an additional audio signal with a 
fundamental frequency about five times that of the original
waveform.
</p>
<p>
If the original sinewave were a musical note middle C, the error signal would
correspond approximately to the E two-and-a-bit octaves above. You almost
certainly wouldn't hear this if the sound were produced by a real
musical instrument -- the E is of comparatively low amplitude, but
that's not the real reason. Most real musical instruments will 
produce a series of overtones that will likely include an E anyway.
</p>

<p>
The problem is the error signal will depend on the intensity and
shape of the
original signal.
This determinism means that the error is, in effect, distortion, rather than
noise, albeit not conventional harmonic distortion of the kind 
produced by amplifiers.
</p>

<h2>How dithering works</h2>

<p>
So can this apparent distortion can be reduced? To some extent, it can --
but not without cost. One way to reduce it is to
apply <i>dithering</i>. 
Dithering amounts to 
adding some random noise to the original samples, before reducing the
number of bits and rounding. The amplitude of the noise should
<i>just</i> be sufficient to abolish any predictable pattern in the
rounded signal. In practice that means using a noise waveform
with a mean amplitude half that of the
least-significant digit in the original waveform. 
</p>

<p>
What we accomplish by doing this is to replace a
(small, we hope) distortion with an equally small amount of random noise.
</p>

<p>
Dithering schemes differ, essentially, in the pattern of the random 
noise applied. A uniform frequency distribution of noise is not
necessarily the most effective, in terms of musicality. A common
scheme is to use a triangular frequency distribution -- that is, a 
noise pattern with most of its amplitude in mid-frequencies.
 An intelligent dithering scheme will be able to
adjust the frequency distribution of the noise to the content of the
musical signal. 
</p>

<h2>Is the ear fooled?</h2>

<p>
It's worth asking, at this point, whether the ear is fooled by this
kind of manipulation. It hard to demonstrate that the ear is, in
fact, capable of being fooled -- it's much easier to see visually.
Visual dithering is a well-established technique. It is, effectively,
how newspapers were able to show photographic images using only a 
mesh of black dots. Even earlier, greyscales have been simulated
using techniques like cross-hatching.
</p>

<p>
Let's see how dithering works, when the number of bits per pixel
is reduced in a monochrome photo.
Here is the original image, which has 8-bit pixel depth (that is,
256 grey values). 
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/dither1.jpg" width="650px" alt="Photo with 256 grey levels"/>
</p>

<p>
Here is the same photograph reduced to just three grey levels: black, white,
and mid-grey. No dithering has been applied -- each pixel has been
rounded to the nearest grey level. 
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/dither2.jpg" width="650px" alt="Photo reduced to 3 gray levels"/>
</p>

<p>
This simple pixel-rounding actually produces acceptable results here,
because there are so few distinct grey levels in the original
photograph, despite the 8-bit representation.
Still, this crude reduction of bit depth results in
the loss of a great deal of detail, especially in the keyboard, where
there is, in fact, a spectrum of grey levels.
</p>
<p>
Here is the same photograph reduced to three grey levels, but with
dithering, implemented by adding a pattern of random noise across
the image, before reducing the bit depth. 
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/dither3.jpg" width="650px" alt="Photo reduced to 3 gray levels with dithering"/>
</p>

<p>
The dithered image shows what appear to be a larger number of grey
levels, but it's an illusion. If you look at the pixel histograms of
the previous two images, you'll see that they are identical --
each has three (identical) grey levels. The eye/brain integrates the
discrete pixels across regions of the image to perceive an
average grey level.
</p>
<p>
Despite the (apparent) increase in detail, the dithered image is
"noisier" than the image without dithering. 
That is, the additional randomness is somewhat visible in the 
dithered image. However, I should point out that a reduction
from 8-bit resolution to 2-bit is a radical change -- the noise
would be much less evident in an image with a larger number of
grey levels.
</p>

<p>
It's not obvious that the ear would be fooled in the same
way as the eye but, in fact, sometimes it is: the effect of dithering is
<i>very</i> evident when the number of bits per sample is eight
or fewer. Once we get to sixteen bits or more, it's much harder
to make a case for dithering. It's important to bear in mind
that the sampling-related distortion will
<i>never</i> be more than one bit -- with a 16-bit signal, that's 

0.2% of the maximum
signal amplitude, or -96dB. 
</p>

<p>
Compare this figure with the performance of typical studio equipment.
A top-quality, completely passive, microphone is unlikely to have
a signal-to-noise ratio of more than 80dB. With amplification
at the microphone -- necessary to cope with long cable runs -- it will
be much less than this. 80dB corresponds to about 14 bits of resolution.
In practice, cabling and amplification will usually introduce a larger
amount of noise than this. The end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio of
a studio recording chain -- with analogue sources -- probably
corresponds to about 13 bits. A one-bit distortion signal in a 16-bit
sample is considerably smaller than this. 
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>

<p>
Whether used in audio of video processing, dithering does not get
us anything for nothing. With careful choice of the
noise spectrum, we can concentrate the noise into frequency regions that
are less discernible. It is often claimed that, with optimal
dithering, the effective dynamic range of a 16-bit audio signal
can be increased from a theoretical 96 dB (65,536 to 1) to 120 dB.
This is an increase in dynamic range of a factor of 16, or four bits.
</p>
<p>
However, no analogue or electronic recording technique offers 
a signal-to-noise ratio even close to this. If fact, it's 
extremely difficult to achieve an instrument-to-ADC signal-to-noise
ratio of more than about 80dB, even with top-notch equipment in
expert hands.   
</p>
<p>
The noise introduced by dithering could, therefore, be an order
of magnitude smaller than the noise that already exists from the
recording process. By dithering, we could be doing nothing more than
resolving the recording noise better. 
</p>
<p>
As always, the ultimate test is the ear. When I convert from
24-bit to 16-bit samples, I can't hear any difference between the
dithered and the straight conversion. But that doesn't mean that
nobody can. Dithering was routinely used in the mastering of
CD recordings, and nobody really questioned that it was effective.
</p>
<p>
Even if the difference between dithered and non-dithered conversion
is actually audible -- and this is hard to demonstrate with 
high-resolution samples -- there's no guarantee that a listener would
prefer one version over the other. Consider the visual
demonstration I showed above -- both the dithered and non-dithered images
have appealing and unappealing elements. I don't see why that wouldn't
be the case for audio as well.
</p>
<p>
If anybody knows of any rigorously-conducted, double-blinded
laboratory tests in this
area, I would certainly like to hear about them.
