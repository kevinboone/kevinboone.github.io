the Google Pixel Camera app on a robustly de-Googled cellphone</h1>
<p><img src="img/degoogle.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>I noticed something odd when I de-Googled and started running Lineage
OS on my Samsung phones: photographs were not as clear or well-exposed
as those from the stock Samsung camera app. I didn’t know why, and I
still don’t – the image data comes from the same sensor and lens.
Nevertheless, the software I used to take photographs was reflected in
the quality of the images.</p>
<p>When I installed Graphene OS on my Pixel 7, I expected to see the
same thing – I was prepared for the photo quality to be less good with
the Graphene open-source camera than the stock Google Camera app (now
called <em>Pixel Camera</em>). It turns out I was right, well, kind-of:
as the JPEG images come straight out of the camera, the results with the
stock, Google firmware were clearly nicer than with Graphene (I’ll show
an example later).</p>
<p>Pixel phones are noted for their cameras, and I wanted to know
whether the differences I saw were related to the choice of camera app,
or to something else. So I wondered how easy it would be to run the
Google Pixel Camera app on my Graphene-equipped phone.</p>
<p>The first question was whether the Pixel Camera app would work <em>at
all</em> without Google Play Services, and with restricted permissions,
to improve its privacy.</p>
<p>Many apps depend on Google Play Services, which is a notorious siphon
of private data. Open-source Android implementations take different
approaches to dealing with this problem, because nobody with a concern
for privacy really want to run Google Play Services. /e/OS, for example,
is supplied with MicroG, a privacy-sparing stub implementation of Google
Play Services. Lineage OS has no such provision by default, but there’s
a well-documented way to install MicroG on Lineage if required. Graphene
takes a completely different approach: it can run the ‘real’ Google Play
Services in a sandbox wrapper, so it behaves like an unprivileged app.
In this way, Play Services can be denied the permissions that make it a
privacy hazard.</p>
<p>I express no opinion on which of these approaches is best, since I
use none of them. I prefer to install only software that does not
require Google’s infrastructure at all. That’s potentially a problem for
Pixel Camera which is, of course, a Google proprietary app.</p>
<p>So I’m pleased to report that, at the time of writing (November 2025)
the latest official Pixel Camera app does <em>not</em> require Google
Play Services. In addition, it can have its network and location
permissions withdrawn, and it still works fine. Without network
permission, I don’t really see any way for it to leak private data, even
if it were inclined to. Google says that Pixel Camera does not collect
or transmit any private data anyway; but I’ve heard reports to the
contrary, so it’s as well to take away any opportunity it might
have.</p>
<p>If you’re running a handset without Google services, you probably
won’t be able to get Pixel Camera from the Google Play store. Instead,
you’ll have to hunt out an APK from a source you trust – <a
href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/camera/">APK Mirror</a>
might be a possibility. Obviously, you have to be careful about
installing apps this way but, if you’re not using Google Play Services,
and your app works with highly restricted permissions, it’s safer than
it would be on a stock handset.</p>
<p>One annoying oddity about Pixel Camera is that it tries to display
the photo it’s just taken using the Google Photos app. There’s no way
(so far as I can see) to make it do anything else. Google Photos can
also be run with its location and network permissions disabled, so I
don’t see a huge privacy problem in installing it. I just don’t like
it.</p>
<p>A solution to this problem is the <a
href="https://calyxos.org/news/2021/09/30/gcam-photos-preview/">Google
Photos stub that was developed for CalyxOS</a>. This is a minimal image
viewer, but that’s all it needs to be. It has the same Android package
name as Google Photos, so you can’t install both at the same time – but
I guess there would never be a need to.</p>
<p>What about handsets that aren’t in the Google Pixel range? It’s
questionable whether they will run the official Google Pixel Camera,
with or without Google Play Services. There are a number of “ports” of
Pixel Camera to non-Google handsets: there’s a list <a
href="https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/">here</a>.
I tried a couple of these on my Samsung phones, but I didn’t find them
very reliable. Whether the problem was that they needed Google Play
Services, and I wasn’t willing to allow this, I’m not sure. There are
many ports to try, but I lacked the patience.</p>
<p>On the Pixel 7, though, the stock Pixel Camera works fine for me. So
is it worth installing it?</p>
<p>On the face of it, it looks as if it might be. The two photos below
are of the same scene, at the same time, captured with the two different
camera apps, with settings as near to identical as I can make them.
Because it’s hard to see the differences when the images are scaled down
to fit on this page,<br />
here are the full-sized versions from the <a
href="img/photocomp_graphene.jpg">Graphene camera app</a> and from <a
href="img/photocomp_pixel.jpg">Pixel Camera</a>. In both cases I’ve
cropped the image from the centre of a larger scene, but I haven’t made
any other edits.</p>

</figure>
<p>When I look at the images on the cellphone screen, there’s no obvious
difference between them. Differences are really only apparent when
looking at them on a large monitor, and particularly when I crop detail
out of a larger scene.</p>
<p>The Pixel Camera version appears, on the face of it, to be in better
focus across the whole scene. There’s a little more detail in the
shadows, and the grass and gravel seem to have more texture. Also, it
looks as if the highlights in the sky are a little less blown out in the
Pixel Camera version.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>The increased texture in the grass and the gravel gives away what I
think is going on here. It seems as if the Pixel Camera JPEG is subject
to an unsharp mask and/or local constrast adjustment. A little time with
Darktable can turn the Graphene camera image into the Pixel Camera image
or, at least, pretty close.</p>
<p>So my feeling at present is that both camera apps are capturing the
same data from the camera sensor, but applying different
post-processing. I think the untouched JPEG images from Pixel Camera are
nicer than those from the Graphene camera, in a whole range of scenes,
but a bit of post-processing sorts that out. So far I haven’t found any
scenes where the Pixel Camera app clearly outperforms Graphene’s camera,
in a way that can’t be fixed. Of course, if you don’t want the hassle of
editing your photos, the Pixel Camera app gives more immediately good
results.</p>
<p>The Pixel Camera app also has some features that open-source camera
apps lack, like panorama and motion blur. I have little use for these
features but, of course, we’re all different. One thing that is of
interest to me is that the Google app saves a raw data file in DNG
format, while the Graphene camera does not. I don’t think it’s ‘real’
raw sensor data, of the kind that a proper digital camera would provide
– it just looks too much like the regular JPEG images, with the same
level of sharpening. In any event, there are other open-source camera
apps that <em>do</em> save a ‘raw’ file, subject to similar limitations.
Whether storing this kind of file is a real advantage is something I’ll
need to take a lot more photos to assess.</p>
<p>In short, the latest Pixel Camera app worked fine on my Pixel 7 with
Graphene, without Google infrastructure, and with its network and
location permissions denied. Whether the hassle of finding and
installing its enormous APK will be reflected in superior photography,
only a lot more experience will tell.</p>
<p>One final point: all smartphone cameras suck, compared with a real
DSLR camera operated by a skilled photographer. Even the tiniest of
‘serious’ cameras like Sony’s RX100 range – which are no bigger than a
smartphone – take better pictures. Of course, your best photos are the
ones you actually take, and I can’t deny the accessibility of a
smartphone camera.</p>
