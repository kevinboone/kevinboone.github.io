<h1 id="social-media-its-not-me-its-you">Social media: it’s not me, it’s
you</h1>
<p><img src="img/tongue_out.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>I have this message for people who find my refusal to use social
media inconvenient:</p>
<p><em>Too bad.</em></p>
<p>Social media is at best a waste of time and, at worst, dangerous.
These days, nobody even contests the fact that it can damage the mental
health of certain groups of people – particularly the young. That
otherwise sensible people are being sucked into wasting hours every day
clicking and scrolling seems, again, hardly a matter of dispute.</p>
<p>Alongside the hazards that social media creates simply by being what
it is are more insidious dangers created by its implementation. A small
group of mega-corporations controls all the popular social media
platforms. By offering the illusion of free services, these corporations
monetize our personal data and habits, violating everybody’s privacy. I
concede that, if you haven’t spent your entire working life in the
computing industry, you might not be well-placed to appreciate these
technological risks. Even those of us who <em>have</em> spent a lifetime
in IT probably don’t understand all of them. The full horrors may yet to
be revealed. Still, the more obvious, psychological risks should be
sufficient discouragement from using social media, even for
non-technologists.</p>
<p>I have to concede that I find it hard to disentangle my distaste for
social media from my dislike of smartphones: they do tend to go
together. Both smartphones and social media are innovations that had the
potential to be powerful forces for good but, in reality, have become
tools of exploitation.</p>
<p>I’m aware that some people get a benefit from social media, and are
either willing to accept the risks, or don’t know (or care) what they
are. Fair enough: it’s not my place to tell you what to do. I can’t stop
you smoking four packs of cigarettes a day either, although I’d
certainly advise against it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I can’t be entirely neutral on this subject. In
principle, it’s not my problem if you’re willing to be force-fed
misinformation by crackpots, and have your privacy violated by the
mega-corps; but it <em>is</em> my problem when social media edges out
all other forms of communication.</p>
<p>If my unwillingness to use it excludes me from real-world social
events, that’s unfortunate; but, frankly, people who are in thrall to
their smartphones make poor company anyway. But it’s starting to exclude
me from charitable and community efforts too, and that’s not OK. A
number of charities for which I used to volunteer no longer ask for my
services, because they don’t have a way to communicate except Facebook
and the like. Their administrators all have my telephone number and my
email address. If all else fails, they know where I live. And, yet, it
seems that if they can’t reach me using a smartphone app, they won’t
bother.</p>
<p>If you don’t want me at your party enough even to send me a text
message, fair enough. But if you need somebody with a four-wheel-drive
truck to pull an ambulance out of a ditch in the snow – something I’ve
done before – and you’re not willing to pick up the telephone, that’s on
you. If you need me to stand on a traffic island all day, directing
participants to your charity event – again, something I’ve done before –
and you can’t even send me an email: sorry. You’ll have to ask somebody
else. Charity administrators have told me in the past that they struggle
to find volunteers to support their work; and, yet, they’ve put
themselves out of contact with people like me <em>who have a history of
working with them</em>, because I don’t use social media.</p>
<p>So, while using social media to make small talk seems harmless enough
to me (even though I’ve no interest in joining in) letting charities and
community organizations become reliant on it seems rather
self-destructive.</p>
<p>While apologists for social media tell us that <a
href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/">64%
of the world’s population use it</a>, it seems odd to exclude the 36%
that do not. That’s still an awful lot of people: billions, in fact.
Moreover, if you’re a charitable organization, you’re probably going to
get better support from people who don’t feel they need to spend three
hours every day fondling a screen.</p>
<p>While we often think of social media dependence as a problem for the
young, I’m relieved to find that a small, but growing, population of
teenagers is limiting or abandoning it. Instead, it appears that people
in the 30-50 age group are increasingly getting drawn in. Perhaps
younger people have already learned how social media trashes their
real-life social lives, while those of us who are middle-aged still have
that unhappy learning experience ahead of us. I suspect it’s mostly the
30-50 group who are running charities and community organizations, and
its <em>their</em> increasing social media addiction that’s causing the
communication problem.</p>
<p>And that brings me to the title of this little rant: if you can’t
contact me because I don’t use social media, I regard that as your fault
for allowing yourself to become dependent on it, not my fault for
avoiding it. I’m not going to change.</p>
