<h1>Software</h1>
<p>
Here are some of the open-source software projects I maintain, other
than for business purposes. Much of my professional work involves maintaining
large open-source projects like Apache middleware, but I've written
quite a lot of software for my own purposes as well. All this software
is hosted on GitHub and, unless stated otherwise, is released under
the terms of the GNU Public Licence, v3.0.
<p/>
<p>
Most of my professional software work is in Java, but I
retain an interest in C and C++ programming.
I have a particular interest in extending the capabilities of
the command line, especially on platforms like Android that don't
offer extensive command-line environments.
<p/>
For more information, see 
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone" target="_blank" rel="me">my GitHub page</a>.

<h2>General command-line utilities</h2>

<div class="sw-desc">
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/kzgrep" target="_blank">kzgrep</a> (C)<br/>
kzgrep is a command-line utility with similar functionality to
'grep', but working on zipfiles. There are many similar utilities
out there, implemented in a variety of different ways, but I've not been
happy with any of them, so I decided to write my own. My main
application for a tool like this 
is searching for text strings in compressed EPUB
ebooks, although it also comes in useful with OpenDocument
(LibreOffice, etc) documents.
</div>

<div class="sw-desc">
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/linux-background-changer" target="_blank">linux-background-changer</a> (C)<br/>
A slideshow background changer for a number of different Linux desktops,
including gnome-shell. The problem with most built-in background changers
is that they expect image files to be in particular places, or they
can't cope with images in nested subdirectories. This one doesn't, and can.
</div>

<div class="sw-desc">
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/dirsize" target="_blank">dirsize</a> (C)<br/>
A command-line utility for calculating the exact total size of a
collection of files. This is more difficult to do than it would
seem, because most utilities that appear similar are intended to 
calculate the amount of disk space used, which is not the same.
The difference might be small, but sometimes it matters.
</div>


<div class="sw-desc">
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/kcalc" target="_blank">kcalc</a> (C)<br/>
A console-based expression evaluator written in C and Lua. 
It supports complex numbers and has an extensible math library.
kcalc is intended to bridge the gap between simple four-function
calculators, and heavyweights like Octave.
</div>

A command-line unit converter that is able to parse unit expressions.
This features gives the utility the ability to convert any units that
have dimensions in common, without having to have an exhaustive list
of conversion factors.
</div>

<div class="sw-desc">
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/dbcmd" target="_blank">dbcmd</a> (C)<br/>
A command-line utility for uploading files to and from
Dropbox. dbcmd has broadly the same command line as rsync, so it
should be familiar to many Unix/Linux users. I wrote this to
use Dropbox to store large numbers of files that did not need to
be kept in sync using the desktop client.
</div>

<div class="sw-desc">
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/amqutil" target="_blank">amqutil</a> (Java)<br/>
A utility to exercise message brokers like Apache ActiveMQ
and Artemis, as well as anything that uses the AMQP protocol. <code>amqutil</code>
can send and receive from queues and topics using various kinds
of message, with or without batching 
(local transactions). It can set arbitrary headers, apply message
filters, and
carry out timing and benchmarking operations.
</div>


<div class="sw-desc">
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/augrep" target="_blank">augrep</a> (C)<br/>
A utility that provides the same kind of search facilities as
grep, but on the metadata (tags) of audio files. Currently 
augrep supports MP3, Ogg, FLAC, AAC, M4A, and M4B files.
</div>


<div class="sw-desc">
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/gettags" target="_blank">gettags</a> (C)<br/>
A simple command-line utility for extracting meta-data (tags) from
a variety of different audio file types.

<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/eput2txt2" target="_blank">epub2txt2</a> (C)<br/>
A utility for extracting text from EPUB documents, and formatting it
for reading on a console or processing by other utilities. 
</div>

<div class="sw-desc">
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/txt2epub" target="_blank">txt2epub</a> (C)<br/>
A utility for converting plain text files, perhaps with simple
markdown-style formatting, into an EPUB ebook.
</div>

A utility to show BBC 3-day weather forecasts in the console.
</div>

<div class="sw-desc">
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/qdtide" target="_blank">Quick and dirty tide calculator</a> (C)<br/>
Given the time of a recent high or low tide, predicts future tides.
I wrote this utility because many of the places I like to spend time have
no Internet access, so access to accurate tide predictions is difficult.
The mechanism that qdtide uses is the same as specialist analogue watches
with a 'tide hand' -- crude, but often effective over relatively
short time periods. 
</div>


<div class="sw-desc">
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/solunar2" target="_blank">solunar2</a> (C)<br/>
A utility for displaying solar and lunar ephemera for selectable
locations and times. solunar also displays calendrical data like
the dates of solstices and Easter. There is an experimental facility
for estimating wildlife activity based on sun and moon alignment.

KBOX4 is a project to port a number of Linux command-line utilities to 
Android, in a way that they could be used without rooting the device.
KBOX4 uses libchroot to provide a virtual Linux filesystem, thus making
it possible to build many Linux utilities for Android with only 
minimal changes.
</div>

<div class="sw-desc">
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/android-audio-sibj" target="_blank">android-audio-sink</a> (C)<br/>
A helper utility for providing audio playback capabilities for Android
console-mode applications. This utility was originally part of the
 <a href="https://github.com/kbox4/source">KBOX4</a> project, but
it might be useful in its own right as a demonstration how to use the
OpenSLES audio library on Android.
</div>

<div class="sw-desc">
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/androidmusicserver" target="_blank">androidmusicserver</a> (Java)<br/>
<i>Kevin's Music Server for Android</i> an Android App that 
provides a web browser interface to 
control playback of audio files stored on an Android devices. This allows the 
Android device to be used as a music server, in multi-room audio applications, 
among other things. Although I wrote this utility for Android 4.0, it 
still works with the latest Android releases. 
</div>

<h2>Raspberry Pi</h2>

<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/PMBASIC" target="_blank">PMBASIC</a> (C)<br/>
A simple BASIC programming environment for the SparkFun Pro Micro, or
similar microcontrollers. I've tried to replicate the BASIC programming
of microcomputers of the 1970s -- the language is simple, and there
is a semi-interactive program editor. Program code is stored in the
microcontrollers EEPROM -- typically 1kB in the Pro Micro.
</div>


<h2>Embedded Linux</h2>

<div class="sw-desc">
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/syslogd-lite" target="_blank">syslogd-lite</a> (C)<br/>
A very lightweight, rolling system log daemon for embedded Linux
systems. This daemon understands the traditional syslog protocol but,
rather than logging to disk, uses a configurable buffer in RAM.
This prevents wear on SD-card storage, and is very fast in operation.
