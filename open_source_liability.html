good deed goes unpunished: can we now be sued over software we give
away?</h1>
<p><img src="img/padlock.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note</em><br />
This article is about law in the UK and EU. Although other jurisdictions
have introduced new legislation that may affect open-source software,
the details are likely to be different.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-is-the-law-changing">Why is the law changing?</h2>
<p>Until recently, developers have generally assumed that the creators
of open-source software are not subject to liability in negligence. If I
write and distribute a software library that creates a security
vulnerability, and some business incorporates that library and leaks all
its customers’ private data, it isn’t my fault. The business that uses
my software might be sued, but I won’t be.</p>
<p>To reinforce that position, we usually accompany our open-source
software with a prominent disclaimer. The disclaimer usually states that
the user of the software accepts all risks that follow from its use. We
deem the incorporation of the software into a product as an acceptance
of the disclaimer.</p>
<p>If such disclaimers are legally enforceable then, when something goes
horribly wrong, it’s difficult to decide who should bear the cost. In
the last couple of years we’ve seen a number of catastrophic software
failures, which have led to ruinous financial losses. Surely, if you’re
affected by one of these failures, you can sue somebody and get
compensation?</p>
<p>For better or worse, it’s all too easy for software suppliers to
disclaim liability. While it seems fair (to me at least) that people who
contribute open-source code with no financial reward should not be held
liable for a national catastrophe, it seems less reasonable that a
mega-corporation should be able to escape in the same way. After all,
it’s the corporation which gets the rewards, so natural justice suggests
that it just accept the risks, too.</p>
<p>Whatever the merits of this position, governments the world over are
starting to legislate to prevent software suppliers disclaiming
liability. Similar provisions already apply to physical goods in many
jurisdictions; it’s about time, we could argue, that software was
brought into line.</p>
<p>Now, every line of software I write for my own purposes ends up on
GitHub as open source, in the hope that somebody else will find it
useful. Of the 100+ applications and libraries I maintain, only about a
half-dozen seem actively to be used by other people. The rest just
languish, waiting for passing interest.</p>
<p>I think, after 40 years, I’m a reasonably competent software
developer. But I certainly won’t claim that any of my software is
defect-free. I would be mortified if somebody used my software and
suffered harm or loss, but until recently I (probably) wouldn’t have
risked being sued to bankruptcy. I hope that my disclaimers make it
clear my software isn’t guaranteed to be suitable for any particular
purpose.</p>
<p>So what concerns me is that the same legal changes that are intended
to prevent mega-corporations evading liability for their shoddy software
will also put me at risk, even though I get no financial reward.</p>
<p>But is that the case?</p>
<h2 id="how-is-the-law-changing">How is the law changing?</h2>
<p>In the UK, we have as yet no particular legislation to change the
distribution of liability for software. However, the Cyber Resilience
Bill will enter Parliament this year (2025) and, most likely, it will be
modeled on the similarly-named EU Regulation. The Cyber Resilience Act
(CRA) is now in force in the EU, although its provisions are scheduled
to take effect over the next few years.</p>
<p>The CRA creates substantial burdens for manufacturers and
distributors of products using ‘digital elements’. Broadly, these
obligations are what we might expect: manufacturers are expected to have
a software security policy, and a mechanism for ensuring that it applies
across the supply chain. They’re expected to handle reports of security
vulnerabilities, and to report any they find themselves. A particularly
chilling provision, in Recital (31) (that is, in the preamble to the
Regulation) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="31" type="1">
<li>Directive (EU) 2024/2853 of the European Parliament and of the
Council is complementary to this Regulation. That Directive sets out
liability rules for defective products so that injured persons can claim
compensation when a damage has been caused by defective products. It
establishes the principle that the manufacturer of a product is liable
for damages caused by a lack of safety in their product irrespective of
fault (strict liability).</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>That a software provider can be held liable <em>without fault</em> is
causing conniptions in the software industry, because it’s exceptionally
difficult to be sure that every software element, particularly in the
open-source world, is completely secure. We <em>need</em> our
disclaimers, the software vendors claim, because ensuring software
quality is just so darned difficult. It’s particularly troublesome when
we use so much open-source software, whose provenance and quality is
uncertain.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand that, as the EU Regulation is a
statutory provision, no disclaimer, however bold the typeface it’s
presented in, will shift the burden of liability from the supplier to
the user. These new provisions apply <em>in addition to</em> the
existing law of liability.</p>
<h1 id="is-free-open-source-software-affected-by-the-cra">Is free,
open-source software affected by the CRA?</h1>
<p>It’s clear that suppliers of software, and products containing
software, will have to take responsibility for their entire supply
chain, including any open-source elements. This will be difficult for
them, and will generally make things more expensive. But it doesn’t seem
unreasonable to demand this of suppliers.</p>
<p>Frankly, I’m not really concerned about the liability of
corporations: I’m concerned about <em>my</em> liability, as a supplier
of free, open-source softare.</p>
<p>The CRA recognizes that open-source projects are in a somewhat
different category from proprietary software, especially when they are
non-commercial.</p>
<p>Recital (18) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In relation to economic operators that fall within the scope of this
Regulation, only free and open-source software made available on the
market, and therefore supplied for distribution or use in the course of
a commercial activity, should fall within the scope of this
Regulation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the face of it, this would appear to exclude the open-source
software I distribute free of charge on GitHub. But does it?</p>
<p>First, we need to know what “made available on the market” means.
Paragraph (22) of Article 3 (“Definitions”) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="22" type="1">
<li>‘making available on the market’ means the supply of a product with
digital elements for distribution or use on the Union market in the
course of a commercial activity, whether in return for payment or free
of charge;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s notable, I think, that you’re not absolved from operating “in
the course of a commercial activity” just because you’re supplying
software free-of-charge.</p>
<p>Recital (18) goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This Regulation does not apply to natural or legal persons who
contribute with source code to products with digital elements qualifying
as free and open-source software that are not under their
responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that you can <em>contribute</em> to an open-source project
without attracting liability, but if you’re <em>responsible</em>, you’re
at risk. Again, the risk only applies to software distributed “on the
market” but, as we’ve seen, that doesn’t mean that money has to change
hands. In fact, the CRA makes it clear in various places that finance
itself is not the determining factor in whether something is commercial
or not. So Art 3, section (13):</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li>‘manufacturer’ means a natural or legal person who develops or
manufactures products with digital elements or has products with digital
elements designed, developed or manufactured, and markets them under its
name or trademark, whether for payment, monetisation or <em>free of
charge</em>;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>(my emphasis). Recital (18) also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mere circumstances under which the product with digital elements
has been developed, or <em>how the development has been financed</em>,
should therefore not be taken into account when determining the
commercial or non-commercial nature of that activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, finance by itself is not a determining factor.</p>
<p>But, happily, there’s a specific exclusion for people who provide
open-source software free-of-charge. Later in Recital (18):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More specifically, the provision of products with digital elements
qualifying as free and open-source software that are not monetised by
their manufacturers should not be considered to be a commercial
activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So my understanding of these various provisions, as they apply to me
and people like me, is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can be a ‘manufacturer’ of software products, and subject to the
full force of the CRA, even if you don’t charge anything for your
software.</li>
<li>But ‘free and open-source’ software has specific exemptions. The CRA
does not apply to <em>contributions</em> to free, open-source projects
that the contributor does not control. My reading is that this exemption
applies whether or not you’re paid for your contributions.</li>
<li>For projects that you <em>do</em> control, you’re not subject to the
CRA as a ‘manufacturer’, provided you don’t make any money. It isn’t
clear to me whether accepting occasional donations amounts to
‘monetization’ here.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this means, I think, that you can provide and contribute to
open-source software that is free of charge, and not have any
obligations as a manufacturer. But if you supply ready-to-run software,
for payment or not, you have a manufacturer’s obligations. It isn’t
clear to me whether the CRA applies if you supply <em>both</em> source
code and binaries, as Linux distribution maintainers often do. I’d like
to hope that, so long as the source code is available, the fact that you
provide binaries <em>as well</em> does not make you subject to the full
weight of the CRA.</p>
<h1 id="what-about-obligations-other-than-as-a-manufacturer">What about
obligations other than as a manufacturer?</h1>
<p>Unfortunately, while I might not be a ‘manufacturer’ or ‘distributor’
if I only provide free, open-source software, I might still qualify as a
‘steward’, and therefore be subject to some of the provisions of the
CRA.</p>
<p>Art. 3 defines an ‘open-source software steward’ as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li>‘open-source software steward’ means a legal person, other than a
manufacturer, that has the purpose or objective of systematically
providing support on a sustained basis for the development of specific
products with digital elements, qualifying as free and open-source
software and intended for commercial activities, and that ensures the
viability of those products;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Art. 24 sets out the obligations of a ‘steward’. It begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open-source software stewards shall put in place and document in a
verifiable manner a cybersecurity policy to foster the development of a
secure product with digital elements as well as an effective handling of
vulnerabilities by the developers of that product.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Art. 24 goes on to create an obligation for ‘stewards’ to cooperate
with cyber-security regulatory bodies to report ad mitigate
vulnerabilities. The obligations of ‘stewards’ are not as onerous as
those of manufacturers. In particularly, they don’t seem to be subject
to the same strict (no fault) liability that applies to manufacturers.
Still, there are obligations, and there are likely to be penalties for
those who don’t comply.</p>
<p>But what actually is a steward? There’s the need, again, for there to
be ‘commercial activities’. That I maintain my own software, and issue
regular releases, does not itself amount to commercial activity. Again,
from Recital (18):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] the mere presence of regular releases should not in itself lead
to the conclusion that a product with digital elements is supplied in
the course of a commercial activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So can I be a ‘steward’ if I maintain my own software with no
payment? It seems plausible to me that if I know that my software is
actually used commercially, even though I receive no payment, I could be
deemed to be a ‘steward’ for the purposes of the CRA. I think that if I
actively work with commercial organizations, I might have to worry.</p>
<p>For example, many of the software projects I maintain on GitHub
receive contributions from other people. For the most part, I don’t know
who those people are, beyond their user IDs. I don’t know whether
they’re using my software for commercial purposes or not. And, frankly,
because “commercial purposes” do not necessarily involve payment, I
might not have any way to find out.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the provisions applying to ‘open-source software
stewards’ are aimed at Linux distributors and open-source software
foundations. I don’t think they were intended to penalize charitable
individuals. However, I can foresee circumstances in which I
<em>might</em> be held to be a ‘steward’.</p>
<h1 id="so-how-worried-should-i-be">So how worried should I be?</h1>
<p>As a provider of open-source software who receives no financial
reward, and does not take part in any obviously commercial activity, I
don’t think I’m a ‘manufacturer’ for the purposes of the CRA. I think
that my existing disclaimers of liability will continue to take effect –
to the extent that they ever did.</p>
<p>I’m unsure whether the CRA would allow me to distribute ready-to-run
binaries along with source code. I rarely do that, anyway, except for
the Raspberry Pi. At some point I will have to consider removing the
binaries completely.</p>
<p>I’m unsure of the exact circumstances that would make me an
‘open-source software steward’. I might have to be more careful about
accepting contributions to my software from anybody who might
conceivably be using it commercially.</p>
<p>Of course, here in the UK we aren’t subject to the EU CRA. I’m hoping
that, by the time we get our own version, it will be clearer how the law
will work.</p>
