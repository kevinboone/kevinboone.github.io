headphone dongles: still sucking after all these years</h1>
<p><img src="img/plug.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>In <a href="headphonejack.html">an earlier article</a> I lamented the
loss of the standard 3.5mm headphone jack from mobile devices.
Ironically, I’m shopping for a new cellphone because the 3.5mm jack on
my Samsung Note 9 has failed. It hasn’t simply stopped working, however.
No – that would be too manageable. Instead, it’s failed in such a way as
to make the cellphone think there’s a headset permanently plugged in.
This means that I get no audio in calls <em>unless</em> I’m using a
wired headset. This isn’t very practical.</p>
<p>Now, I have to admit that one of the reasons manufacturers gave for
dropping the 3.5mm jack is that these connectors are prone to failure
because of damp or debris. The <em>real</em> reason, as we all know, is
that cellphone suppliers have colossal investments in wireless headphone
technology, investments of a scale that will have the entire board of
directors brushing off their CVs if they don’t make a good return. Even
knowing this, though, I can’t deny a grudging recognition that, in this
one instance, they might have had a point.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, I’ve been considering whether I might begin to
speculate on the possibility of buying a cellphone without a 3.5mm jack
– something I long ago decided I would only consider when the Devil was
driving to work on a snow-plough. Unfortunately, it’s getting more and
more difficult to buy a modern, quality cellphone with a 3.5mm jack;
difficult, at least, on my budget.</p>
<p>I’m going to be using wired headphones or, at least, keeping the
capability to use them, for all the reasons I explained in my earlier
article. So I obtained a few USB-C headphone dongles to try out with my
headphones. I’ve always had problems with these in the past, but I hoped
that maybe things had improved.</p>
<p>They hadn’t.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem…</h2>
<p>I invite you to look at the two dongles in the photo below, and tell
me whether either will work on my Samsung Note 9 or my Samsung S5E
tablet.</p>
<p><img src="img/usb-c-dongles.jpg" class="article-centre-image" /></p>
<p>Don’t know? Nor did I.</p>
<p>It turns out that the black one works with the tablet, but not the
cellphone. The white one works with both. But the black one sounds
better than the white one, with the device that supports them both, and
it generates quite a bit more volume into the headphones.</p>
<h2 id="why">WHY?</h2>
<p>USB is supposed to be a standard, so why is compatibility between
devices so unpredictable? The two dongles in the photo cost about the
same (not much), and were advertised simply as a “USB-C headphone
adapter”. Both claimed broad device compatibility. It’s nearly ten years
since cellphone vendors started dropping the 3.5mm jack – why does this
absurd situation continue?</p>
<p>The <em>technical</em> explanation is that, despite common belief,
USB can actually carry <em>analog</em> signals, as well as digital data.
That is, a cellphone or tablet can output ordinary analog audio through
its USB port, if it wants. The commercial explanation, however, is
something I’ll return to later.</p>
<p>The audio signal that reaches our ears is, of course, an analog one.
To get this analog signal from the digital data manipulated by a mobile
device, we need a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) somewhere. In the
days when all cellphones had a 3.5mm jack, the DAC was part of its own
hardware. The cellphone’s DAC was wired to the jack, probably through an
audio amplifier, which was wired directly to the headphones.</p>
<p>Having dumped the 3.5mm jack, a question naturally arose: where
should we put the DAC now? It would be perfectly feasible to put it in
the headphones or in a USB adapter dongle. However, this adds cost to
every such device. A good case can be made for keeping the DAC in the
cellphone, even if it doesn’t have a 3.5mm jack, and routing the analog
audio through the USB port. After all, the USB standards supported this
mode of operation – it’s called “audio accessory mode”. USB
<em>isn’t</em> purely a digital standard.</p>
<p>Cellphones are now divided into two groups: those that output analog
audio through their USB ports, and those that do not. The latter require
a headphone dongle which has its own DAC. A dongle designed for use with
audio accessory mode won’t work if there is, in fact, no DAC in the
device, or if it isn’t wired to the USB port. A USB headphone dongle
that <em>doesn’t</em> contain a DAC is essentially just wires, and dirt
cheap to make.</p>
<p>So you might be wondering whether there is any way to tell which
mobile devices support audio accessory mode – and will work with a
DAC-less (“passive”) dongle – and which don’t. So far as I know, there
is not. My S5E tablet does and, presumably, has a built-in DAC to do it.
My Note 9 does not, <em>even though</em> it has a built-in DAC, to drive
the 3.5mm jack. Other than enduring a good deal of web searching,
there’s still really no way to know which USB dongles work with which
mobile devices.</p>
<p>Then there’s the question of sound quality. The black dongle in the
photo above sounds better, with decent headphones, than the white one,
when connected to the same tablet. Why?</p>
<p>The explanation is that the black dongle has no built-in DAC, which
is why it doesn’t work with the Note 9. This dongle requires a device
that supports audio accessory mode. In this mode, the analog audio is
generated by the device, not the dongle. I presume that my Samsung
tablet has a better DAC than my cheap dongle. My Samsung phone also has
a better DAC, but it isn’t wired to the USB port, so it can’t be used
with a dongle.</p>
<p>Is there any way to tell in advance whether you’ll get better sound
quality from a dongle that contains a DAC, rather than a device’s
built-in DAC? Probably not for certain; but I would guess that
<em>any</em> mobile device that has a built-in DAC at all, is going to
have a better DAC than a cheap USB dongle. That’s certainly been my
experience, at least.</p>
<p>Is there any way to tell in advance whether a particular headphone
dongle even has a built-in DAC? And, if it does, whether there’s any way
for it to fall back on the analog signal provided by the mobile device,
if it provides one? Again, I think the answer is probably ‘no’. It’s
perhaps safe to assume that if the advertising refers to a DAC, the
dongle probably has one; but I’ve never seen this kind of advertising
with any technical detail about the DAC.</p>
<p>As for the mobile device itself: I happen to know – thanks to a bit
of web searching – that my Note 9 has a built-in DAC made by Wolfson: a
reputable manufacturer of such parts. It certainly produces
great-sounding audio into wired headphones through its 3.5mm jack. I
also know that the Note 10, and probably most newer Samsung cellphones,
does <em>not</em> have a DAC. So if I want to get decent audio quality
into wired headphones from such a device, what must I do?</p>
<p>What I <em>can’t</em> do, sadly, is simply use one of those cheap
USB-C headphone dongles. It might be convenient to use one – if it works
– but, if your dongle costs only a few pounds, it <em>doesn’t</em>
contain a hi-fi quality DAC. My Note 9 <em>does</em> contain a hi-fi
quality DAC, and it galls me that more modern cellphones increasingly do
not.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-we-get-here">How did we get here?</h2>
<p>It’s worth speculating about how this absurd situation came about,
and why it’s still a problem ten years after manufacturers started to
drop the 3.5mm jack. I suspect that, when this benighted development
began, cellphone vendors still provided wired earphones in the box. Even
if they didn’t, there were large numbers of analog earphones and
headphones in use. It was probably cheaper for vendors to provide cheap
analog earphones, and a completely passive USB dongle that relied on a
DAC in the cellphone, than to design and supply a DAC-equipped dongle.
After all, USB audio accessory mode allowed analog audio to be routed to
the USB port.</p>
<p>This meant, of course, that the manufacturer would have to provide a
DAC in the handset; but cellphone manufacturers had already been doing
that for decades. They already had the designs and the tooling for it.
In short, it was cheaper for vendors to continue to put DACs in their
cellphones, than in their dongles.</p>
<p>I speculate further that the market soon became flooded with
dirt-cheap, passive headphone dongles, that would have worked with most
handsets at the time. As time passed, however, and DAC-equipped dongles
started to be cost-effective to manufacture, cellphone vendors had less
motivation to continue to provide a DAC, and they quietly stopped doing
so. This didn’t remove all the incompatible dongles from the market,
though, and they’re still widely sold.</p>
<p>There is a more cynical explanation, however.</p>
<p>Cellphone manufacturers don’t just want to get rid of the 3.5mm jack:
they want to get rid of wired audio support <em>completely</em>. They’ve
bet the farm on wireless audio gadgets, so they have to sell cart-loads
of them to cover their investments. One way to do that is to ensure that
consumers have no practical alternative. It’s in the manufacturers’
interest to allow the UBS-C audio confusion to continue, especially when
they can blame somebody else when things don’t work.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-do-we-do">So what do we do?</h2>
<p>If you don’t care about sound quality, the situation is simple
enough: buy a cheap headphone dongle that you can be reasonably sure
includes a built-in DAC. This will work with cellphones with and without
audio accessory support in their USB ports. You’ll need to make some
inferences from the dongle’s advertising, because it won’t usually be
particularly clear. You might need to buy more than one, as I did; but,
happily, they’re not expensive.</p>
<p>If you <em>do</em> care about sound quality, then you’ll need to
obtain a cellphone with a good-quality built-in DAC, and then shop
around for a headphone dongle that <em>doesn’t</em> contain its own DAC.
Again, you’ll need to make inferences from the advertising.</p>
<p>My DAC-equipped dongle shows up as a USB DAC when I plug it into my
Linux laptop; I presume the same would be true for other operating
systems. The non-DAC dongle doesn’t register at all, since it has no
electronics of its own. These facts don’t help me to choose which dongle
to buy, but at least they help me to understand why things don’t behave
as I expect.</p>
<p>Of course, if you really care about sound quality, you’ll probably
want to use a hi-fi USB DAC, not a dongle. There are many of these on
the market, and some are reasonable portable. None is cheap,
however.</p>
<h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h2>
<p>My foray into the murky world of USB-C headphone dongles hasn’t
encouraged me to adopt this technology. Most likely I will continue to
use handsets that still have headphone jacks.</p>
