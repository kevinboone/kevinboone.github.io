<h1>Exchanging files between an SC130 CP/M board and a Linux system</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/chip.png" 
  alt="Chip logo"/>
This article is one of my series 
<a href="rc2014.html">Adventures with RC2014, Z80, and CP/M</a>.
I'm building a CP/M system based on an SC130, Z180-based 
single-board computer, and I need a way to copy CP/M applications to, and
get data from, this system using Linux. 
</p>
<p>
The SC130 uses the RomWBW BIOS, which structures storage in a particular
way. The technique I describe for using <code>cpmtools</code> for
data exchange will work with RomWBW systems that use compact flash cards,
rather than SD cards,
or even regular hard disks; but it probably won't work with other
BIOS implementations. However, using protocols like XModem to pass
file data through the console from a terminal
emulator should work on any CP/M system that has
the relevant software.  
</p>

<h2>Using cpmtools to read/write the SD card</h2>
<p>
The SC130 uses an SD card for storage. RomWBW organizes this card into
'slices' of 8Mb, this being the maximum size of a CP/M hard disk. 
It's easy enough to take the SD card out of the SC130's card slot and
put it in a modern card reader, but the data format is not something
that a modern computer will natively understand.
</p>
<p>
The <code>cpmtools</code> utility is designed to handle data transfers
between the host platform and CP/M-formatted disks. The tricky part
is specifying the disk geometry correctly, when the 'disk' is actually
a slice on some larger storage medium. The problem is exacerbated by
the fact that the version of <code>cpmtools</code> available in
most Linux repositories is broken. I've been told that the Mac OS/X
implementations are similarly problematic.
</p>
<p>
So it will almost certainly be necessary to build <code>cpmtools</code>
from source. The source is available <a href="https://github.com/lipro-cpm4l/cpmtools" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>. For me, building was as simple
as <code>make; sudo make install</code>. 
</p>
<p>
The stock version of <code>cpmtools</code> does not have built-in support
for RomWBW disk formats. However, a replacement disk definition file
<code>diskdefs</code> is provided <a href="https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/blob/master/Tools/cpmtools/diskdefs" 
target="_blank">in the RomWBW source</a>. 
</p>
<p>
It is important to understand that each 'slice' of the RomWBW disk
has its own entry in <code>diskdefs</code>. By default, drives A and
B are generated internally by the BIOS; removable drives start
at C. For the SD card, drive C is the entry <code>wbw_hd512_0</code>
in the <code>diskdefs</code> file, while drive F is <code>wbw_hd512_3</code>.
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>Because there can be more disk slices on an SD card than there are letters in the alphabet, the RomWBW version of CP/M has a utility <code>assign</code> to map slices onto drive letters. My examples assume that the defaults are still in effect.</blockquote>

<p>
I'm using a USB card reader to manipulate the SD card. It appears as
Linux device </code>/dev/sdb1</code> on my system although, of course,
this assignment will depend on what other storage devices are connected.
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>It's important to be be sure about the device that represents the SD card reader, because running <code>cpmtools</code> against the <i>wrong</i> storage device will do colossal damage to it.</blockquote>

<p>
With these settings, copying a file <code>test.com</code> from my
Linux system to drive F on the SD card amounts to:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ sudo cpmcp -f wdw_hd512_3 /dev/sdb test.com 0:
</pre>

<p>
The <code>0:</code> here is user area zero -- the default user area
for files on CP/M.
</p>

<p>
There are comments in the RomWBW version of <code>diskdefs</code> that
explain how to work out the various configuration parameters for
slices after the first four (drives C-F).
</p>

<h2>Using XModem</h2>

<p>
The RomWBW version of CP/M has a built-in utility <code>xm</code> for
doing XModem file transfers. Other CP/M utilities are available for
more sophisticated transfer protocols like Kermit. An irritation with
XModem is that the protocol does not carry the filename; so it's
necessary to specify the filename at both ends of the communications
channel. However, XModem is easy to use and widely supported.
</p>
<p>
Most terminal emulators support XModem, and many support other things 
as well.
For my terminal emulator I use Minicom on Linux. This has
main menu entries "Send files" 
and "Receive files". So the basic procedure to send a file from the
Linux system to the CP/M system is: 
</p>
<p>
1. On the CP/M system, run 
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
b:xm r {filename}
</pre>

<p>
2. In Minicom, hit 'ctrl-A, Z' to raise the main menu, then 'S' to
send files, then 'xmodem'. Then select the file to send. 
</p>

<p>
3. Have a cup of tea, if the file is substantial -- XModem is not
particularly fast.
</p>

<p>
It's worth pointing out that any file transfer method from a modern
computer to a CP/M system will requires functioning flow control, or the
transfer baud rate will have to be set to a very slow value. 
</p>

<h2>Using a floppy disk</h2>
<p>
Of course, the 'authentic', 1985-vintage method for passing data from
one computer to another is by floppy disk. At the time of this writing,
I do not have a working floppy disk drive in my CP/M system, but
I'm working on it.
