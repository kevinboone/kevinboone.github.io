<h1>cwordle -- A Wordle-like word-guessing game for CP/M</h1>
<p>

Unless you've been on a space mission or a religious retreat for the
last year, you will almost certainly have encountered the 
web-based game "Wordle". Essentially, you have to guess five-letter
words, with the program telling you which letters in your guess
are correct and
in the right place, and which are correct but in the wrong place.
It's a simple concept, but surprisingly engaging. It's similar in 
many ways to the old number game "bulls and cows", but more accessible.  
</p>

<p>
But how will you get your Wordle fix if all the modern computers in the
world have strangely vanished, leaving nothing made since 1980?
That's obvious -- play Wordle on CP/M. 
</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>
There's no doubt that this program could be implemented in a very compact
format in assembly language. However, because it's not important enough
to spend many hours on it, I wrote it mostly in C. Some parts are in
assembly, particular the console I/O and random number generation
(more on this latter subject later). The Manx Aztec compiler I use
for this kind of C development doesn't do console I/O very efficiently
-- it works fine, but it includes an awful lot of unnecessary library code. 
I've replaced all this with simple BDOS calls. 
</p>
<p>
As a matter of principle, I build my CP/M programs using CP/M 
tools. However, in practice I run the build on a Linux machine using
a CP/M emulator, just because it's so much quicker than using real
hardware.
</p>

<h2>Word list</h2>
<p>
The word list for the Linux spell utility provides a convenient
source of words. It's easy to use command-line tools to 
randomize them and select a specific number. There are about
five thousand, five-letter words in this list, but cutting it 
down to 4096 (2<sup>12</sup>) makes the programming easier.
Quite a few of these 4096 words are rather obscure, but that just
adds to the challenge.
</p>

<h2>Random number generation</h2>
<p>
The Aztec C compiler doesn't include any random number facilities, but
it's easy enough to implement a 16-bit XOR-and-rotate pseudo-random
generator in assembly language. Or in C, for that matter; but
doing it in C generates about 600 bytes of code, rather than 20 bytes
in assembly. 
</p>

<p>
The problem is not generating pseudo-random numbers as such -- the problem
is seeding the number generator with some source of entropy. A conventional
way to do this in modern systems is to use some digits from the real-time
clock, but CP/M systems don't have a real-time clock -- not one with a
standard API, anyway. 
</p>

<p>
It was common on the Z80 CPU to use the R register as a source of
entropy. This register was used for timing updates to dynamic RAM.
However, as R is only an 8-bit register, it doesn't provide
a way to select randomly from 2<sup>12</sup> words. So I've fallen
back on the old trick of a having a "Press any key..." message on start-up,
and timing how long the user waits to press a key. Even at Z80 speeds,
tens of thousands of CPU cycles will elapse in the time it takes for
the user to press a key, so this works reasonably well in my
tests on real hardware. I could add
some extra entropy using the R register, but this would limit the
program to Z80 systems, and I didn't want to do this when the rest
of the program works fine on the 8080.

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
Games of this sort are ideally suited to CP/M systems. They can be 
played using only a line-based terminal, as they need no graphics. They don't
require a large amount of memory, or huge CPU power. There's no doubt
the game could be improved -- if there was any interest -- by
using screen-based features of terminals. For example, the different
guess results (right place, wrong place, wrong) could be highlighted
in different, more visible ways. I could maintain a list of which 
letters had been discovered to be definitely in, or not in, the secret
word, on some other part of the screen. As it stands, <code>cwordle</code>
could be played using a teleprinter.
