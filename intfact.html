<h1>Integrating factors from the ground up</h1>

<img class="article-top-image" src="img/integral.jpg" 
  alt="integral sign"/>
The use of an integrating factor is a powerful method for solving differential
equations (DEs) or, at least, simplifying their solution. A large class of
first-order DEs are readily amenable to solution this way, and this article
describes, step-by-step and from first principles -- why that is so,
and how to do it.
<p></p>
Despite its power, the use of an integrating factor is a somewhat 
obscure procedure, which rests
on some rather fiddly theory, and can be awkward to remember.
The theory is usually explained in textbooks
in a highly abstract way, assuming a level of background knowledge that
readers often don't have. My goal in this article is to explain the subject
step-by-step, using specific examples to illustrate the theory, and
documenting the procedure in the form of an algorithm.
<p></p>
I'll start by describing how a specific kind of first-order
DE can
be rewritten in such a way that one side is expressed as just
the derivative of a product, so that only integration of the other 
side is needed to get a solution. I'll show how this analysis leads to a
simple formula that will allow a certain class of first order DEs 
to be solved systematically.
Although limited in scope, the method is 
conceptually straightforward, and does not require any 
use of partial differentiation. 
<p></p>
I then explain in more detail what is meant by an <i>exact</i> DE, and
show how to solve an exact DE in the general case, by integration and
the solution of a subsidiary (hopefully simpler) DE. Finally, I explain
how to find an integrating factor that will make a first-order DE 
exact in the general case. 
<p></p>
This article assumes at least basic familiarity with differential equations
and calculus.

<h2>Overview</h2>

Consider this rather ugly-looking, non-linear differential equation (DE):

$$ y' - \frac{y \, tan x}{2} = \frac{x}{2y \, cos x} $$

On the face of it, it looks pretty difficult to solve -- it does to me,
anyway. However, if we are fortunate enough to have a sudden flash
of insight, it's almost trivially simple. The insight is to recognize
that this DE can, with nothing more than high-school
algebra -- be rearranged to look like this:

$$ 2y \, y' \, cos x - y^2 sin x = x $$ 

If you're wondering why that's an improvement, that's certainly understandable.
The trick, however, lies in spotting that 

$$ 2y \, y' \, cos x - y^2 sin x = \frac{d}{dx} y^2 \, cos x$$ 

To see that this is so, apply the product rule and the chain rule to the
right-hand side, and you'll see that it gives the left-hand side.
<p></p>
What this means is that the rather ugly DE we
started with can be rewritten in a much simpler form:

$$ \frac{d}{dx} y^2 \, cos x = x$$ 

If we integrate both sides we get

$$ y^2 \, cos x = \int x dx = \frac{x^2}{2} + C $$ 

and this we can rearrange to give an expression for <i>y</i>, again using
no more than high-school algebra.
<p></p>
Solving this equation required a certain amount of inspiration. 
Much as I'd like to be the kind of person who is prone to
such mathematical epiphanies, I'm not, and I suspect 
few people are -- I knew the answer because I started with
the answer and worked back to the question. Since in real science and
engineering problems we usually can't do that, the question arises
whether there is some systematic way in which we can transform an arbitrary
DE into one that can be expressed in the form

$$ \frac{d}{dx} f(x,y) =  g(x)$$ 

If the DE can be expressed in this form
-- which is an example of what is known in the math trade as an
<i>exact equation</i> -- then the DE reduces to
an integration problem.
<p></p>
There are two distinct problems tangled up here. The first is
recognizing when a diferential equation is, in fact, exact -- it's
often not obvious (I suspect the example I gave above was not 
obvious to most people). The second is handling a situation where
the equation is not exact, and no amount of shuffling the terms
about with algebra changes that. For many first-order DEs, 
both these problems can be solved by the use of an <i>integrating factor</i>.
By multiplying all terms in the DE by the integrating factor --
which we have to determine first -- we transform the DE into an exact equation,
that can be solved by integration.
<p></p>
In practice, finding an integrating factor is often difficult. Moreover,
having found one we frequently find that we've 
transformed an intractable DE into an
equally intractable integration puzzle. Sometimes, however, we get lucky.


<p></p>

<h2>An example from first principles</h2>

Let's consider how we can find and use an integrating factor for a simple,
first-order differential equation: 

$$ y' + 3y = x $$

Note that this DE is in 'conventional form', where the coefficient of
<i>y'</i> is 1, and there are no <i>y</i> terms on the right-hand side.
It's certainly easier to apply the process if we start of this way.
<p></p>
Because this DE is so straightforward, we can see at once that it is not
exact, but it <i>almost</i> is; that is, it has a <i>y'</i> 
term and a <i>y</i> term
on the left hand side, making it look as if it could be rearranged 
into the form 

$$ \frac{d}{dx} y \, u(x) = x $$

so that the left-hand side will fall out as a result of applying the
product rule, giving us:

$$ \frac{d}{dx} y \, u(x) = u y' + u'y $$


But it just doesn't quite work with the DE as it stands -- so far 
as I can tell, no amount of
simple symbol-juggling will allow us to find a function <i>u</i>
that will substitute <i>d(uy)/dx</i> for the LHS of the original DE. That is,
there is no <i>u</i> that satisfies

<p></p>

$$ uy' + u'y = y' + 3y $$

If <i>uy'</i>=<i>y'</i>, then <i>u</i>=1; but then <i>u'</i> can't equal 3. 
 
<p></p>
Now let's assume that, although the DE is not exact at present, there is
some function of <i>x</i>, or <i>y</i>, or both, by which we can multiply 
through, which will make it exact. Let's try a function of <i>x</i> for
now; I will call that function <i>g</i>(<i>x</i>). So we can write the DE as:

$$ g(x) y' + g(x) 3y = g(x) \, x $$

In order to make the left-hand side obtainable by the product rule we
need the following equality to hold:

$$ uy' + u'y = g(x) \, y' + g(x) \, 3y $$

Equating coefficients gives:

$$ u=g(x), u'=3\,g(x) $$

Differentiating the first of these equations gives:

$$ u'=g'(x), u'=3\,g(x) $$

and so

$$ g'(x)=3\,g(x) $$

So it seems we have a way to find <i>g</i>(<i>x</i>), but it involves
solving another differential equation. Have we really gained anything
here?
<p></p>
Well, it turns out that this particular DE is very easy to solve -- we can
separate variables, or just see by inspection that 

$$ g(x) = e^{3x} $$

This is the solution because 

$$ \frac{d}{dx} e^{3x} = 3 e^{3x} $$ 

Readers who are still awake should have spotted that I've cheated a bit
here: solving this DE for <i>g</i>(<i>x</i>) will have given an arbitrary
constant of integration as part of the solution, but I have ignored it.
It's safe to do that here, because all we're looking for is something
to multiply every term in the DE. Putting the constant of integration
in won't hurt, but it isn't necessary, because it will cancel out in
later steps of the procedure. Remember that we can multiply every term
in an equation by anything at all -- the goal here is to find something
that simplifies the solution process, not necessarily a part of
the solution itself. 
<p></p>
Having determined <i>g</i>(<i>x</i>) we can rewrite the original
DE:

$$ e^{3x} \, y' + e^{3x} \, 3y =  e^{3x} \, x $$

Now we know that the left-hand side of this equation can be written
in the form

$$ \frac{d}{dx} y \, u(x) $$

because we derived the integration factor starting from that assumption.
Had the assumption been incorrect, we would not have been able to get
an integrating factor. In that case, we might have had to try a
function of <i>y</i> instead, or some other approach (see later
pages in this article for more details.) We also know, 
from an earlier result, that

$$ u=g(x) $$

So our DE can now be written:

$$ \frac{d}{dx} y \, e^{3x} = x \, e^3x $$

and we can just integrate both sides to get:

$$ y \, e^{3x} = \int x \, e^{3x} $$

We're not quite done, because to carry out the integration we'll need
to integrate by parts (or some other trick). I'm not going to write out
all the steps -- it's just too tedious. In the end, we get:

$$ y \, e^{3x} =  x \, e^{3x} - \frac{e^{3x}}{9} + C $$

so

$$ y =  \frac{x}{3} + \frac{C}{e^{3x}} - \frac{1}{9} $$

The constant C will have to be determined from the initial conditions,
in the usual way.
<p></p>

You'll note that to get to this point we had two hurdles to
jump over: solving a differential equation to get the integrating factor,
and then integrating the right-hand side of the equation to get
the solution. It turns out that, in practice, the first of these hurdles
is not a high one for most first-order equations; but the second can be
insurmountable.
<p></p>
In practice, we don't want to carry out a detailed analysis every time
we have to solve a first-order DE. So it's time to see how the process
can be generalised to a method -- a formula, even --
for DEs whose form I described on this page. 

 

<h2>Deriving a formula to solve certain first-order DEs</h2>

In the previous section I showed, using a specific DE, how an integrating
factor could be derived which allowed the DE to be expressed as
an integral. This turned a problem in solving a DE into a problem in
calculating an integral. 
<p></p>
In this section, I'll show how this procedure can be generalized into
a method that will solve a large class of first-order differential
equations -- anything that can be expressed in the following form:

$$ y'(x) + p(x)\,y(x) = q(x) $$

As all functions on this page will be functions of <i>x</i>, for
brevity I will usually drop the '(<i>x</i>)' from function names.
<p></p>
This derivation is more abstract than the previous example, because we
aren't working with specific functions. Nevertheless, the procedure
is <i>exactly</i> the same. Rather than ending up with a specific
integrating factor <i>g</i>, we'll have an expression to derive 
<i>g</i> from <i>p(x)</i>. From there, we can express the solution
of the differential equation as a simple formula. Of course, although
the formula is easy to write down, it involves the calculation of 
two integrals, either
of which might be rather difficult in practice.
<p></p>
Although this derivation is relatively straightforward, I doubt that knowing
the details will help you remember the final result. So if you think you
might just need the result to use in an examination, and don't care
how it is derived, skip right to the
end of this page.
<p></p>
As before, I'll use <i>g</i> [ =<i>g</i>(<i>x</i>) ] to represent the 
integrating factor. So, multiplying the DE by the (as yet unknown)
integrating factor <i>g</i>:

$$ g\,y' + g\, p\,y = g\,q $$

We want the left-hand side to reduce to the form

$$ \frac{d}{dx} u\,y  $$
 
where <i>u</i> is a function (presently unknown) of <i>x</i>.
<p></p>

Expanding this derivative gives:

$$ uy' + u'y $$

which we want to be equal to the left-hand side of the DE, including
the integrating factor. So:

$$ uy' + u'y = g\,y'+g\,p\,y $$

Equating coefficients gives:

$$ uy' = g\,y',\, u'y = g\,p\,y $$

So

$$ u = g,\, u' = g\,p $$

Differentiating the first of these equations gives

$$ u'=g', u'=g\,p$$

and thus: 

$$ g' = g\, p $$

Solving this simple DE by separating variables:

$$ \int \frac{1}{g} = \int p\,dx $$

$$ log(g) + C = \int p\,dx $$

$$ g = e^{\int p\,dx - C} = k e^{\int p\,dx }  $$

Since we're going to multiply every term in the DE by this new function
<i>g</i>, we can ignore the constant of integration <i>k</i> as it
will eventually cancel out, and
just write the integrating factor as:

<p style="border:solid 1px">

$$ g(x) = e^{\int p(x)\,dx} $$ 

</p>

Notice that this integrating factor depends only on the term
<i>p</i>(<i>x</i>) in the original DE.

<p></p>

We could now proceed to multiply all the terms in the DE by 
the integrating factor, and solve it as before. But we can go
one step further, and reduce the whole solution process to
a formula.
<p></p>
We know that the left-hand side of the DE can be reduced to 

$$ \frac{d}{dx} y\,u = y\,g  $$

Because if it could not, we could not have determined a value for <i>g</i>. So
replacing the left-hand side:

$$ \frac{d}{dx} y\,g  = g\, q $$

Integrating both sides:

$$ y\,g + C = \int g\, q\, dx $$

$$ y\,g = \int g\, q\, dx  - C $$

Since the constant C is arbitrary, it doesn't matter what sign we give it;
conventionally it is written as positive in this application. This leads
to the final result -- a formula that gives the solution of the DE:

<p style="border:solid 1px; padding:5px">

If a differential equation can be expressed in the following form:

$$ y'(x) + p(x)\,y(x) = q(x) $$

Then the solution of the equation is given by

$$ y(x) = \frac{\int g(x)\, q(x)\, dx  + C}{g(x)} $$

where 

$$ g(x) = e^{\int p(x)\, dx} $$

and the constant of integration in the last expression can be ignored.

</p>

 

<h2>Using the integrating factor formula to solve a DE directly</h2>

In the previous section I showed how to derive a formula for the solution
of a DE of a particular class, based on an integrating factor.
Just as a reminder: 

<p style="border:solid 1px; padding:5px">

If a differential equation can be expressed in the following form:

$$ y'(x) + p(x)\,y(x) = q(x) $$

Then the solution of the equation is given by

$$ y(x) = \frac{\int g(x)\, q(x)\, dx  + C}{g(x)} $$

where 

$$ g(x) = e^{\int p(x)\, dx} $$

</p>

Let's apply this method to the example I used earlier:

$$ y' + 3y = x $$

In this example <i>p</i>=3 and <i>q</i>=<i>x</i>. So the
integrating factor <i>g</i> is given by:

$$ g = e^{\int p\, dx} = e^{\int 3\, dx} = e^{3x} $$

Remember that the constant of integration can be ignored, because it
would cancel in the following step. The solution of the
DE is

$$ y = \frac {\int g\,q\, dx + C}{g} $$
$$  = \frac {\int x\,e^{3x}\, dx + C}{g} $$

Evaluating the integral using integration by parts:

$$ y = \frac {x e^{3x} + \frac{e^{3x}}{9} + C}{g} $$
$$ = x e^{3x} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{C}{e^{3x}} $$

This is exactly the same result we obtained two pages back, up to the
sign of the arbitrary constant.
<p></p>
Whether using this explicit formula for the solution is easier than
carrying out an analysis of the DE and working from first principles
in unclear; it probably
is if you can remember the formula, and the DE happens to have
the appropriate form.


<h2>A more general approach to exact differential equations</h2>

In the previous pages I explained how to determine an integrating factor
for differential equations that could be put into the form

$$ y'(x) + p(x)\,y(x) = q(x) $$

The integrating factor was arrived at by assuming that the left-hand side
of the DE could be viewed as the differential of a product

$$ \frac{d}{dx} u(x)\,y $$

The we expanded the differential and equated terms, to get a (simple)
DE that gave us the integrating factor.
<p></p>
The problem is that not all first-order DEs can be put into the necessary
form. So now it's time to consider a complementary approach, which will
work on a larger class of differential equations. This method is more
complex in that it requires at least an elementary understanding of
partial derivatives.
<p></p>
Instead of considering the left-hand side of a DE as product, we'll
consider it as the derivative of a function of both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.
Differentiating this using the total derivative formula will give us
an expansion with which we can equate terms against the original DE.
<p></p>
The method will only work directly if the DE is exact, that is, if
it is already in the form where the left-hand side can be expressed as
a single derivative. If it isn't, we'll need to introduce an integrating
factor. But first, we need to examine in more detail how to solve an 
exact DE, in situations where the corresponding derivative is not
obvious (or where we don't even know whether the DE is exact in the first
place, which is usual).
<p></p>
The first step in the process will be to write the differential equation
in the form:

$$ M(x,y) + N(x,y)\frac{dy}{dx} = 0 $$

And we'll end up rewriting this equation in the form

$$ \frac{d}{dx} f(x,y(x)) = 0 $$

If we can do this, then the solution of the DE follows immediately,
because by integrating we get

$$ f(x,y(x)) = C $$

  <tr>
    <td>
      Note: <br/>
      <font size="-1">
      The right-hand side of the DE does not have to be zero. 
      It generally <i>can</i> be zero, because its terms can
      be incorporated into <i>M</i> or <i>N</i>. You can't leave any
      <i>y</i> terms on the right-hand side, because anything remaining 
      there will eventually have to be integrated with respect to <i>x</i>.
      Sometimes it might be easier to leave some <i>x</i> terms on
      the right, and integrate at the end -- this might make it easier
      to find an integrating factor (at the expense of creating another
      integration challenge). I don't discuss this complexity further
      in this article, but it's something to bear in mind in practice.

Of course, finding the function <i>f</i> is the problem. Because this
is a function of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, we can expand it using the
total derivative rule (also called the chain rule for partial
derivatives):

$$ \frac{df}{dx} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{dx} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dx}   $$

But, of course, <i>dx/dx=1</i>, so

$$ \frac{df}{dx} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dx}   $$

I hope it is reasonably clear that this expansion has a form similar to
that of the differential equation we're trying to solve, when it's written
in the necessary form; so we're trying to find a function <i>f</i>
that will satisfy

$$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dx} =  M(x,y) + N(x,y)\frac{dy}{dx} $$

This isn't necessarily straightforward but, when we're done, the 
DE is solved.
<p></p>
It is a useful property of derivatives that, provided the functions are
differentiable, the order of differentiation does not matter. So

$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} $$

Now since we're equating terms:

$$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = M(x,y); \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = N(x,y) $$

What this independence of order of differentiation means is that

$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial y} M(x,y) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} N(x,y) $$

The above relationship will only be true if the original differential
equation is in 'exact' form; that is, if the left-hand side can be
expressed as a single derivative.
<p></p>
Let's check that out with the oringal DE that I started this article with.

$$ y' - \frac{y \, tan x}{2} = \frac{x}{2y \, cos x} $$

We need it in the form

$$ M(x,y) + N(x,y)\frac{dy}{dx} = 0 $$

Which we can get with a a bit of algebraic juggling:

$$ [-y^2 sin x - x] + [2y \, cos x]y'  = 0 $$ 

Here the square brackets just indicate where the boundaries of the
<i>M</i> and <i>N</i> terms are -- it is a common error to lose
track of a minus sign at this point (common for me, anyway).

$$ M(x,y) = -y^2 sin x - x $$
$$ N(x,y) = 2y \, cos x $$

Differentiating <i>M</i> with respect to <i>y</i>, and <i>N</i> with
respect to <i>x</i>, in both cases gives -2sin(x). So we know,
if we did not already, that we are dealing with an exact DE here.
<p></p>
The question what to do if the DE is <i>not</i> exact is one that I'll
come back to later -- that's where the integrating factor will come in.
For now, we have to consider how we will get the function <i>f</i>,
given that we know <i>M</i> and <i>N</i>, when we know that the DE
is exact.
<p></p>
Since we know that <i>M</i> and <i>N</i> are both (partial) derivatives
of <i>f</i> -- now that we are sure this is an exact DE -- then we
can get <i>f</i> by integrating either of these expressions. Of course,
we must take trouble to ensure that we integrate with respect to the
correct independent variable -- <i>x</i> in the case of <i>M</i> and
<i>y</i> in the case of N. So let's do both:

$$ f(x,y) = \int M(x,y) \, dx = \int -y^2 sin x - x\, dx = y^2 \, cos x - \frac{x^2}{2} + C(y)$$
$$ f(x,y) = \int N(x,y) \, dy = \int 2y\,cos x\, dy = y^2 cos x + D(x) $$

Why are these values of <i>f</i> not the same? We get <i>M</i> and <i>N</i>
from the same function <i>f</i>, so how have we got two different <i>f</i>s?
The answer is that we haven't -- it just looks as if we do. The problem
is that we get get <i>M</i> from <i>f</i> by <i>partial</i> differentiation.
If <i>f</i> contains any terms that are only functions of <i>y</i>,
then they are treated as constants in the partial derivative, and vanish.
This is why I have written the constants of integration <i>C</i> and
<i>D</i> as functions -- they aren't actually constants at all in this
case -- they are the missing terms that were 'lost' during the 
partial differentiation, and which we must now restore.
<p>
I evaluated both integrals in the example above, just to 
make the differences between them clear. In practice we only 
need one integral,
and we can pick the easiest one. So, in this case, let's
use the result derived from <i>N</i> that

$$ f(x,y) = y^2 cos x + D(x)$$

Since we get <i>N</i> by differentiating <i>f</i> with respect to <i>y</i>,
we should be able to get <i>M</i> by differentiating <i>this</i> value 
of <i>f</i> with respect to <i>x</i>. We have to differentiate <i>D</i>,
of course, when we do this.

$$ M(x,y) = \frac{d}{dx} (y^2 cos x + D(x)) = -y^2 sin x + D'(x) $$

But we know from the original DE that

$$ M(x,y) = -y^2\,sin x - x $$

so

$$ M(x,y) = -y^2\,sin x - x  =  -y^2 sin x + D'(x) $$

which leads to

$$ D'(x) = -y^2 sin x + x + y^2 sin x = -x $$

Integrating <i>D</i> gives

$$ D(x) = -\frac{x^2}{2} + E $$

So the value of <i>f</i> derived from integrating <i>N(x,y)</i> is

$$ f(x,y) = y^2 cos x - \frac{x^2}{2} + E $$

E is a constant of integration and, this time, it actually is a constant.
<p></p>
We can heave a deep sigh of relief at this point, because the value of
<i>f</i> arrived at here is the same (up to a constant) as the one
derived by integrating <i>M</i> earlier. Had these turned out to be
wildly different, then we would been sure of a mistake somewhere.
<p></p>
The value of <i>f</i> we've calculated here is the solution to the
differential equation:

$$ y^2 cos x - \frac{x^2}{2} + E = c$$

But since E and c are both arbitrary constants, we can collapse them together:

$$ y^2 cos x - \frac{x^2}{2} = C$$

This is the same result we arrived at back on the first page of

So let's sum up the steps in handling exact DEs, or DEs that 
might be suspected to be exact.

<p style="border:solid 1px;padding: 5px">
1. Write the DE in the following form:

$$ M(x,y) + N(x,y)\frac{dy}{dx} = 0 $$

2. Check that

$$ \frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x} $$

If the equality holds, the DE is exact, and we can proceed.
<br/>
3. Integrate <i>N(x,y)</i> with respect to <i>x</i> to get a 
result for <i>f(x,y)</i>, including a 'constant' of integration, 
that is actually a function of <i>x</i>. 
<br/>
4. Partially differentiate <i>f(x,y)</i> with respect to x,
including the constant.
<br/>
5. Set this derivative equal to <i>M(x,y)</i>, and solve for the
'constant'.
<br/>
6. Substitute the 'constant' back into the <i>f(x,y)</i> from step 3.
Set <i>f(x,y)</i>=c, where c is a constant. This is the solution to the
DE.
<br/>
7. Rearrange the solution to get an explicit solution in terms of
the independent variable if necessary (and possible).
<p></p>
In step (3), it is reasonable to integrate <i>M</i> rather than
<i>N</i> if it is easier, but swap all the <i>M</i>s and <i>N</i>s,
and <i>x</i>s and <i>y</i>s, in the following steps.
 

 
<h2>Finding an integrating factor in the general case</h2>

In the last section, I explained how to check whether a differential
equation was exact -- capable of being expressed as a single
derivative -- and to solve if it if it was. This is all very well
if the DE happens to be exact. If it is not, we can try to make it
exact. A couple of pages back I explained how to get an integrating 
factor for DEs whose form is

$$ y'(x) + p(x)y = q(x) $$ 

and showed that the integrating factor was always

$$ g(x)=e^{\int p(x)\, dx} $$

The method I will explain now is based on the analysis on the previous
page, and will work (in principle) with any first-order DE 
that can be expressed in this form:

$$ M(x,y) + N(x,y)y' = 0 $$

I say 'in principle' because, again, although the method will work, we
may still be left trying to integrate something intractable.
<p></p>

For illustration, I will use the following DE:

$$ [3xy + 2y^2] + [(x^2 + 2xy)]y' = 0 $$

As before, the square brackets indicate the grouping of terms to form
<i>M(x,y)</i> and <i>N(x,y)</i>. So we have:

$$ M(x,y) = 3x+2y^2 $$
$$ N(x,y) = x^2 + 2xy $$

You probably won't be surprised to read that I've picked this example 
to demonstrate the technique without pages and pages of algebra; we
aren't always so fortunate.
<p></p>
We can see that this DE is not exact, using the differentiation
technique described on the previous page: to be exact we
require

$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial y} M(x,y) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} N(x,y) $$

and, unfortunately,

$$ 4y \ne 2x + 2y $$

As before, we proceed by assuming that there is an integrating factor
that will make the DE exact. That is, there is some function of
<i>x</i>, or <i>y</i>, or both, by which we can multiply the DE 
and make it exact. As before, I will call the integrating factor
<i>g</i>, and I'll assume that it is a function of <i>x</i>. If this
assumption fails, we'll need to try a function of <i>y</i> and,
if that fails, a function of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. So far as I know,
there is no obvious way to determine which of these kinds of integrating
factor will work simply by looking at the DE -- we might have to
try more than one.
<p></p>
With the integrating factor, the DE will be

$$ g(x)M(x,y) + g(x)N(x,y)y' = 0 $$

In this case:

$$ g(x)[3xy + 2y^2] + g(x)[(x^2 + 2xy)]y' = 0 $$

This gives us new <i>M</i> and <i>N</i> terms, which I will call
<i>M2</i> and <i>N2</i>. For this DE,

$$ M2 = g(x)(3xy + 2y^2); N2 = g(x)(x^2+2xy) $$

For this modified DE to be exact, we need

$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial y} M2(x,y) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} N2(x,y) $$

or, specifically,

$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial y} g(x)(3xy + 2y^2) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} g(x)(x^2+2xy) $$

Evaluating the derivatives gives us:

$$ g(x)(3x+4y) = g'(x)(x^2+2xy) + g(x)(2x+2y) $$

Evaluating the right-hand integral required the chain rule, because 
<i>g(x)</i> is a function of <i>x</i>; for the left-hand side, <i>g(x)</i>
is treated as a constant when taking the partial derivative with respect
to <i>y</i>. Rearranging and collecting terms, we get

$$ g(x)=x g'(x) $$

because I've picked the numbers carefully to make it come out this way.
Whatever the numbers, using this method is going to leave us with a
DE to solve; we hope it is easier to solve than the original DE.
<p></p>
In this case, the solution is obvious -- we need something that gives 1
when differentiated by <i>x</i>, and the only thing that fits the
bill is <i>x</i> itself. So

$$ g(x)=x $$

In a more realistic example, we'll usually be able to solve by separating
variables, and hoping we end up with a manageable integral.
<p></p>
The result of all this manipulation is that we now have something that
we know is an exact DE:

$$ x(3xy + 2y^2) + (x^2 + 2xy)xy' = 0 $$

I gave the step-by-step procedure for solving this DE on the previous
page, so I'll just outline the steps here.
<p></p>
Integrate <i>N</i> with respect to <i>y</i>:

$$ f(x,y) = \int (x^2 + 2xy)x dy = x^3y + x^2y^2 + D(x) $$

Differentiate <i>f(x,y)</i> with respect to <i>x</i>, and set
the result equal to <i>M(x,y)</i>:

$$  3x^2y + 2y^2x + D'(x) = x(3xy+2y^2) $$

Solve for D'(x):

$$ D'(x) = 3x^2y + 2y^2x - 3x^2y - 2y^2x = 0 $$

Another 'lucky' result! Integrate to get D(x):

$$ D(x) = \int 0 \, dy = C $$

Substitute <i>D(x)</i> back into <i>f(x,y)</i>:

$$ f(x,y) = x^3y + x^2y^2 + C $$

So the (implicit) solution to the DE is

$$ f(x,y) = x^3y + x^2y^2 = c $$
 
To get an explicit solution for <i>y(x)</i>, you'll need to use
the quadratic formula, or something of that sort.
<p></p>

In summary, the procedure for finding an integrating factor that will
make a DE exact is as follows.

<p style="padding:5px;border: solid 1px">

1. Write the DE in this form:

$$ M(x,y) + N(x,y)y' = 0 $$

2. See if it is already exact, by comparing the partial derivative
of <i>M</i> with respect to <i>y</i> with the partial derivative of
<i>N</i> with respect to <i>x</i>. If the derivatives are equal, the
DE is exact; no further work is required to make it exact, so solve
it using the method described earlier in this article.
<br/>
3. Let

$$ M2=g(x)M(x,y); N2=g(x)N(x,y) $$

4. Determine <i>g(x)</i> by solving the (hopefully straightforward)
DE

$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial y} M2(x,y) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} N2(x,y) $$

5. If no solution can be obtained, try replacing <i>g(x)</i> with
<i>g(y)</i>, then <i>g(x,y)</i>.
<br/>
6. If an integrating factor is obtained, rewrite the DE in the form

$$ gM(x,y) + gN(x,y)y' = 0 $$

and solve it using the method described on <a href="intfact5.html">page 5</a>.

<h2>Summary</h2>

I've explained, starting from first principles, how an integrating 
factor can be obtained for a large class of first-order
differential equations. The full method is lengthy and, frankly, rather
error-prone with pencil-and-paper calculation, so it might be wise to 
approach the solution of a first-order DE
in the following way.

<p style="padding:5px;border: solid 1px">

1. Can it be solved using straightforward techniques such as 
separation of variables or a simple substitution? There's no point
employing a complex method when a simple one will do.
<br/>
2. see if the DE can be arranged into the form

$$ y'(x) + p(x)y(x) = q(x)  $$

If it can, the derive an integrating factor from <i>p(x)</i> as
described earlier, multiply through, rearrange, and integrate.

<br/>
3. Can the DE be put into one of the well-studied forms, like
Bernoulli's or Ricatti's equations? These well-known classes of DE have
straightforward, methodological solution procedures. An integrating factor 
might also
work in these cases, but the textbook procedure is likely to be quicker.
<br/>
4. Arrange the DE into the form

$$ M(x,y) + N(x,y)y' = 0 $$

5. Test whether it is already exact and, if so, solve it directly,
by rearranging and integrating.
<br/>
6. If it is not exact, attempt to derive an integrating factor using
the method on the previous section.
