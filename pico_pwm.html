using crude PWM for sampled audio output on the Raspberry Pi Pico
doesn’t sound that great</h1>
<p><img src="img/chip.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is a well-established method of
digital-to-analog conversion. It’s inexpensive, easy to understand, and
easy to implement. The desktop Raspberry Pi uses it for its default
audio output, and many developers (including myself) use it on the Pico
as well, which doesn’t have any built-in audio support.</p>
<p>The basic principle of PWM audio is simple: we generate a rectangular
waveform whose period is the same as the sample rate, and set the duty
cycle between 0% and 100%, according to the amplitude of the sample at a
specific time. The duty cycle is the ratio of the ‘on’ to the ‘off’ time
– a 100% duty cycle means that the output is ‘on’ all the time; 0% means
‘off’ all the time. A 50% duty cycle is half-on, half off.</p>
<p>So if the sample value is (say) 25% of the maximum at some point in
time, we set the duty cycle to 25% at that time. If we generate this
waveform at a Pico GPIO pin, then the <em>average</em> voltage will be
about 25% of 3.3V.</p>
<p>Of course, this process isn’t sufficient on its own – we want a
smoothly-varying analog audio signal, not a rectangular waveform. So we
have to smooth, or filter, the rectangular waveform using analog
components – resistors and capacitors, essentially.</p>
<p>By ‘crude’ PWM I mean using PWM with an absolute minimum of external
parts. On the Pico, that means a single GPIO pin, and a couple of
resistors and capacitors.</p>
<p>The Pico has built-in PWM controllers, so it’s easy to apply the PWM
technique to generate audio waveforms, including from sampled sound
files. But does it actually work in practice? Well, yes, with a suitably
generous interpretation of the word ‘work’. Crude PWM can produce audio
with quality good enough for sound effects and spoken alerts, but it’s
nowhere near good enough for music.</p>
<p>In this article I explain why this is the case, and what can be done
about it. Knowing how to improve the situation, we can make an informed
choice whether it’s worth the cost and effort. Bear in mind that
proprietary digital-to-analog (DAC) converter ICs and modules are not
expensive, and they’re straightforward to use.</p>
<p>TL;DR – it will almost always be better to use a real DAC. Using
crude PWM is only appropriate if you really have to minimize components,
or you don’t have enough free GPIO pins to integrate a proper DAC.</p>
<p>If you’re interested, the C code I’m using for testing is in <a
href="https://github.com/kevinboone/picotrainsound">my GitHub
repository</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-cant-just-connect-an-audio-device-to-a-gpio-pin">Why you
can’t just connect an audio device to a GPIO pin</h2>
<p>Well, to some extent, you <em>can</em>. You could connect a
high-impedance headphone directly between a GPIO pin and ground, and
then drive it with PWM. If this works at all, it works because
electromechanical properties of the headphone will implicitly do the
filtering needed to reconstruct the analog signal from the PWM waveform.
It’s most likely to work if you use a PWM frequency of hundreds of kHz –
well beyond the range of human hearing.</p>
<p>Such a simple approach won’t work with low-impedance headphones, or a
loudspeaker. These devices look to the Pico essentially as a short to
ground; but you could just put a resistor in the series, which will make
the low-impedance device look like a high-impedance device.</p>
<p>These trivial techniques do work, after a fashion. But there’s a
problem.</p>
<p>The Pico is a single-ended (single-supply) device. On its own it
<em>can’t</em> produce an AC output: its GPIO pins output either ground
(or close to ground) voltage or supply voltage (or close to it, about
3.3V). There is no way to make the Pico output a negative (less than
ground) voltage from a GPIO pin.</p>
<p>This means that if you connect a GPIO pin to an audio device, it’s
going to try to pass a constant, DC current through the device. This
current might be small, which is why sometimes we get away with it. But
it’s not a good long-term approach.</p>
<p>As a minimum, we need a way to block this DC current from the audio
device. We can do this easily enough using an ordinary capacitor. The
problem is that a capacitor used this way creates a high-pass filter,
and that’s the opposite of what we need to remove the PWM waveform – for
that we need a low-pass filter. So as a minimum we’re going to need some
combination of high-pass and low-pass filtering.</p>
<p>And, suddenly, our low-component-count solution doesn’t have as few
components as we might have hoped.</p>
<h2 id="the-trouble-with-filters">The trouble with filters</h2>
<p>For my application, I’ve implemented a variation of the RC circuit
that the Raspberry Pi uses (see below).</p>
<p><img src="img/pico_pwm_circuit.png"
class="article-center-image" /></p>
<p>The only significant difference in my circuit is that I’ve chosen
components that set the low-pass cut-off to about 8kHz, rather that
20kHz. This is because in my application I’m using 16kHz sampling, so I
can fit all the sample data in the Pico ROM (more on this point
later).</p>
<p>This circuit has a voltage divider (R1/R2), a low-pass filter
(R1/C1), and a high-pass filter (R1/C2). C2 is a comparatively large
capacitance, because we want to pass frequencies right down to the
bottom of the audio range, about 20Hz. The purpose of the voltage
divider is to reduce the ~3.3V peak level of the PWM pin to about the
300mV RMS we need for sensitive headphones, or to connect to an
amplifier.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at the frequency response of this circuit, which I
simulate using the following SPICE netlist.</p>
<pre><code>Pico RC filter
Vi 1 0 dc 0 ac 1
R1 1 2 220
C1 2 0 470n
R2 2 0 100
C2 2 3 47u
R3 3 0 1800

.control
ac dec 10 2 20k
run
plot db(v(3)/v(1))
.endc

.END</code></pre>
<p>The frequency response over the audio range looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="img/pico_pwm_plot.png" class="article-center-image" /></p>
<p>The 3dB pass band extends from a few Hz to about 8kHz, as I said we
needed. But the frequency response is still unsatisfactory and, to
explain why, we need a bit of a theoretical diversion.</p>
<h2 id="nyquist-and-all-that">Nyquist, and all that</h2>
<p>According to Nyquists’s theorem, to reconstruct a sampled waveform
with perfect accuracy, we need to sample at twice the highest frequency
in the original waveform. So, if human hearing extends to 20kHz, we need
to sample at 40kHz or higher.</p>
<p>Most people who have at least dabbled in electronics know this. What
not everybody knows is that Nyquist’s theorem only applies at all if we
have a perfect reconstruction filter. That is, Nyquist assumes we have a
perfect way to remove all frequencies above the cut-off point. If we’re
sampling at 40kHz, we must remove <em>all</em> frequency components
above 20kHz, and <em>none</em> below this frequency.</p>
<p>Such a perfect low-pass filter does not exist, and cannot be
made.</p>
<p>And that’s the problem with the simple filter I showed above.
Ideally, it needs to cut off sharply at 8kHz, for a 16kHz sampling
frequency. It doesn’t, though – there’s significant pass-through at
10kHz, and even 20kHz. I can’t cut off more of the components above 8kHz
without also affecting those in the band we want to pass.</p>
<p>This simple RC filter is described as <em>first-order</em>: although
it has two filter elements – one low-pass and one high-pass – each
element has only one RC combination. A filter like this has a frequency
response that rolls off smoothly, beyond its notional cut-off point.
Filters of this kind are well-behaved – they don’t ‘ring’, for example,
when subject to a step change in voltage. But they really aren’t
suitable for digital to analog conversion. Ideally, we need a
fourth-order filter, and that’s not something we can construct just
using resistors and capacitors – not the kind you can buy from Farnell
or RS, anyway.</p>
<p>How do <em>real</em> DACs solve this problem? And can we do the same
thing with the Pico?</p>
<p>Since we can’t easily make an analog filter with a suitable
specification, we cheat, and use <em>oversampling</em>. we take the
digital data we get from sampling at 40kHz (or whatever), and
mathematically synthesize what we would have got at, say, 192kHz. This
doesn’t get us any new samples, not really – we can’t make data that
isn’t there. But if we want to filter everything above 20kHz, that’s a
whole lot easier if there’s nothing in the raw PWM waveform between
20kHz and 192kHz. We can do this filtering using a much simpler analog
circuit, than if we have to cut off cleanly between 20kHz and 40kHz.</p>
<p>We can apply this oversampling technique on the Pico. We just set the
PWM clock frequency to, say, four times the sampling frequency, and then
output each sample four times in a row. The trivial computation required
to do this is quite within the capabilities of a Pico. Ideally, we ought
to interpolate between the samples, rather than just repeating them –
repeating the samples generates artefacts of its own. Still, a measure
of oversampling is possible on the Pico.</p>
<p>Does it work? Well, kind-of. I can hear a slight difference between
no oversampling and two-times oversampling, but little beyond that
point. It’s worth experimenting in this area, but I suspect that
inadequate analog filter behaviour probably isn’t the limiting factor in
audio performance on the Pico.</p>
<h2 id="gpio-lines-arent-designed-for-analog-output">GPIO lines aren’t
designed for analog output</h2>
<p>One of the great things about digital electronics is precisely that
it’s <em>not</em> analog. That is, a digital circuit isn’t particularly
bothered by a bit of noise. For a Pico GPIO pin, a logic ‘1’ is any
voltage over about 2V, and a ‘0’ anything below about 1V. Noise would
have to be enormous to generate a logical error that makes a ‘1’ read as
a ‘0’. This is exactly why digital electronics is such powerful approach
to computation.</p>
<p>Precisely because that’s the case, digital designers don’t have to
worry much about how noisy their data lines are. The GPIO pins on a Pico
are very noisy indeed, with impressed voltages in a spanning a wide
frequency band, including the audio range.</p>
<p>The simple high/low-pass filter I showed above is designed to pass
frequencies in the audio range. It has to, of course, or we wouldn’t
hear anything. If the GPIO outputs are subject to noise in the audio
range, then no amount of filtering will help – the filter will
specifically <em>include</em> the unwanted noise.</p>
<p>The way to get around this problem, in a real DAC, is to pass the
digital signals through a buffer that uses a stabilized power supply.
Then the digital lines can be as noisy as they like (up to a point) –
the analog filter circuit is fed from the stabilized power supply, not
directly from the digital signals. The buffer is essentially cleaning up
the digital signals.</p>
<p>Can we do this with the Pico? Sure we can. But we need a stabilized
power supply and the appropriate buffers. These things aren’t expensive,
but they add to the component count.</p>
<p>In my experience, noise on the Pico’s GPIO pins is probably the worst
offender, for giving us poor audio quality. It’s definitely worth trying
to tackle this problem. If you don’t want the additional components to
clean up the signals properly, there is a dirty trick, which is to use a
poorly-documented feature that puts the Pico’s 3.7V power supply into
“SMPS” mode. SMPS stands for “switching mode power supply”, and I
presume that the Pico designers had in mind that users might feed the
GPIOs into analog circuity. Here is the relevant code:</p>
<pre><code>gpio_init (PICO_SMPS_MODE_PIN);
gpio_set_dir (PICO_SMPS_MODE_PIN, GPIO_OUT);
gpio_put (PICO_SMPS_MODE_PIN, 1);</code></pre>
<p>In my experience, this trick hugely reduces the noise in the audio
output. But, because it’s essentially undocumented, I have no idea what
side-effects it might have. Better to use a proper buffer, if the
component budget allows for it.</p>
<h2 id="pop-music">Pop music</h2>
<p>Although I’ve mentioned it before, it’s worth stressing that the Pico
is a single-ended device. Its GPIOs can’t output a voltage lower than
ground. When we’re using PWM, the PWM duty cycle extends from 0% to
100%. There’s no such thing as “-100%”. So if a sample value is ‘zero’,
at some point, where do we set the PWM duty cycle? It can’t be 0%,
because that would leave us with no way to handle a negative sample
value.</p>
<p>The logical solution is to represent the sample ‘zero’ value as a 50%
duty cycle. Then positive sample values will be output using a greater
than 50% duty cycle, negative ones less than 50%. What this means is
that the GPIO is outputting a square wave with 50% duty cycle <em>even
when no sound is playing</em>.</p>
<p>We use a high-pass filter (i.g., a capacitor) to prevent this 50%
duty cycle creating a constant current in the audio device. However, the
capacitor has to charge. When the PWM is first switched on, there will
be a very audible ‘pop’ in the audio signal, as the DC current rushes
through the capacitor.</p>
<p>There isn’t really much that can be done about this, with a
single-ended power supply. What’s needed is a differential amplifier
with split (positive and negative) supplies, to subtract 1.15V (or
thereabouts) from the GPIO voltage, before the low-pass filter. This
will give an AC rectangular wave whose average voltage is zero for a
zero sample value. This subtraction can be implemented using an op-amp
and a handful of resistors, but it does require the provision of a split
supply.</p>
<h2 id="getting-the-jitters">Getting the jitters</h2>
<p>So far, we’ve considered what can be done at the purely analog level
to improve sound quality. However, we still have to think about the
digital domain.</p>
<p>Suppose we’re setting a PWM frequency of 16kHz, and we want to feed a
new sample into the PWM controller accurately at the start of each PWM
period.</p>
<p>The problem is that it takes time to do that – the PWM controller
runs asynchronously of the application, and it’s not entirely clear what
happens if you push new values into the PWM controller in the middle of
a cycle. Aligning the program to the PWM controller can be tricky.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Pico can generate an interrupt at the end of each
PWM cycle. So all we have to do to keep everything in sync is to clock
in a new value to the PWM controller every time the interrupt fires. In
my sample code, I used an interrupt service routing to clock sample
values from flash ROM into the PWM controller.</p>
<p>‘Jitter’ is any error in the timing of a change to the output level
of a digital-to-analog converter. We hear Jitter as a kind of harmonic
distortion. At hi-fi audio sampling frequencies, designers aim to keep
jitter down to nanosecond levels, but there’s little evidence that
anybody can hear jitter that small. We can certainly hear it when it
gets to tens of microseconds, though.</p>
<p>The use of interrupt-based timing reduces the jitter associated with
clocking data into the PWM controller. However, it doesn’t do anything
to mitigate timing errors in the PWM controller itself, or in the Pico’s
system clock. I don’t have any particular reason to think that these
errors are huge, however – not compared to all the other errors we have
to contend with.</p>
<h2 id="lets-not-forget-the-obvious">Let’s not forget the obvious…</h2>
<p>Any application using sampled audio on a Pico has cope with the fact
that the Pico has limited storage. Sampled audio is notorious for using
a lot of storage.</p>
<p>There are essentially three ways around the storage problem: reduce
the audio quality, compress the data, or increase the storage. Of these,
reducing the quality is by far the easiest and cheapest. That’s the
approach I’m taking, anyway. But even at 16kHz and 8 bits per sample,
the entire flash of the (Version 1) Pico will only hold two minutes of
audio – not allowing for any program code.</p>
<p>If you want CD-quality sound, you’re down to about ten seconds.</p>
<p>Compression (e.g., MP3) is possible, but it’s CPU-intensive, and the
Pico doesn’t have much RAM, either, to do the computation in. The Pico
can certainly read audio data from an SD card, but at the expense
(again) of increased component count.</p>
<p>The problem of storage doesn’t just affect PWM audio, of course –
almost any Pico audio application could potentially run into the same
problem. It’s perhaps more troublesome with applications using crude PWM
because, by their very nature, designers are likely to be aiming for low
cost and low component count.</p>
<h2 id="but-does-it-work">But does it work?</h2>
<p>Yes, crude PWM with a handful of resistors and capacitors works, up
to a point. You have to pay close attention to power supplies and
component layout, but it’s possible to get <em>adequate</em> sound
quality from crude PWM for a range of applications. Spoken alerts are
pretty comprehensible, for example. Human speech has a relatively low
bandwidth, so it’s possible to use low sample rates (to reduce storage)
and to design even a simple filter that will pass speech frequencies,
while keeping out most of the cruft. Sound effects like bells, whistles,
explosions, and the like also work fine. In my experience, these sounds
are a bit ‘crunchy’ with 8-bit sampling, but they’re still perfectly
recognizable.</p>
<p>What are the alternatives?</p>
<p>For about £5, you could buy a self-contained module that plays MP3 or
WAV files from an SD card. These modules usually support a comparatively
small number of sounds, selected at runtime by asserting particular
input pins. These modules don’t usually sound wonderful – they’re
designed for toys and greetings cards; but they’re inexpensive and easy
to use, and typically have a lot more storage than the Pico. Of course,
such an approach is only appropriate if your application requires a
relatively small number of pre-recorded sounds.</p>
<p>For sample sizes, you could implement a resistor ladder. For example,
for 8-bit samples, you’d need sixteen accurate resistors and eight GPIO
pins. However, because the GPIO pins are so electrically noisy, I’m not
sure this approach would work any better than PWM.</p>
<p>For a bit more money, a number of suppliers provide hi-fi quality
DACs that attach directly to the Pico. You’ve still got to contend with
the limited storage, but the sound quality is hugely better. These DACs
typically use the I<sup>2</sup>S interface. This isn’t as easy to use on
the Pico as crude PWM, but there’s plenty of sample code around.</p>
<p>You could, in principle, use the Pico’s USB Host mode with a USB DAC.
These devices are widely available and produce decent audio at low cost.
However, I’m not sure that driving a USB DAC would be straightforward;
so far I’ve not seen any code that does it.</p>
<p>If you want the ultimate in audio quality, you could design your own
DAC using a chip like the PCM5100. This isn’t a trivial job, because you
still need careful layout and well-designed power supplies – it’s not
just a case of slapping the chip onto a breadboard.</p>
<p>All in all, there are many ways to get audio output from a
microcontroller like the Pico, and most of them offer better sound
quality than crude PWM. However, crude PWM does work, after a fashion,
and costs only pennies to implement.</p>
