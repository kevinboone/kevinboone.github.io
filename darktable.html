<h1>Yet another Darktable/Lightroom comparison</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/gtk-logo.png" alt="colour logo"/>
Although it might not be obvious, I often put a lot of work into these
articles. Some take a substantial amount of research; some require me to think
hard about how to express myself clearly; some have to be supported by code,
or mathematical analysis.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, however, I just want to write something quickly, because 
it's been a long day, and I just can't be bothered to do a proper job.  On
these occasions -- and this is one -- I don't really care whether I'm original,
or even comprehensible: I'll just waffle about the same old stuff as
everybody else with a website and too much leisure time. 
</p>
<p>
So here we go... my uninspiring addition to a long-running argument about
Adobe Lightroom vs. Darktable, for photo organization and editing.
</p>
<p>
There is one slight difference, perhaps, between my view and those
of most people who have written on this subject: I'm writing as a long-time
Linux user, whose main reason for moving to Darktable is its Linux
support. There are financial reasons as well, but Linux support is the
clincher for me.
</p>

<h2>Why wouldn't you use Lightroom?</h2>
<p>
Adobe Lightroom is overwhelmingly the most widely-used application for
cataloging and bulk editing of digital photographs. It's been around for
decades, and probably everybody who uses a digital camera has used it at some
point. Lightroom isn't trivially easy to use, but there's a vast amount of
tutorial information available, as well as dozens -- perhaps hundreds -- of
books.  Lightroom is so well-developed and ubiquitous that it's hard to see
any reason to use anything else. 
</p>
<p>
Lightroom combines photo organization with non-destructive editing. 
These are two different jobs, really, and software is available to do each
task independently. What made Lightroom revolutionary when it was first
released was that it could manage the entire digital photography 
workflow in a single piece of softare. Darktable's maintainers are at
pains to point out that Darktable should not be viewed as a replacement
for Lightroom; nevertheless, it certainly looks like one, and it too offers
the possibility of integrating the entire workflow into one 
application.
</p>
<p>
If you're prepared to consider Darktable a potential replacement for
Lightroom, there are two good reasons to take it seriously. First, Adobe's
subscription-based pricing model is very expensive, for people who aren't
using the software to make money. Because it's subscription-based, you're
locked into paying the subscription forever, or risk being unable even to look
at your photos later. Darktable is free.  Second, Darktable runs under Linux.
That won't be a deciding factor for everybody, but it's a big deal for me -- I
have no other reason than Lightroom to run anything but Linux. Abandoning
Lightroom allows me to say goodbye to Windows forever, at least on my home
computers. 
</p>
<p>
Full disclosure: I think Lightroom is a splendid piece of software. I've used
almost nothing else for photo management for ten years, and I've been happy
with it -- apart from the need to maintain a Windows system. I didn't lightly
abandon it, and I don't think else should, either. It was a hard decision, and
I imagine it would be even harder for somebody who uses Windows, or runs a
Mac. For those people, the consideration is essentially financial, unless 
there are specific features of Darktable that make it appealing in
its own right. Those features do exist, in fact.
</p>

<h2>How Darktable is like Lightroom</h2>
<p>
Darktable isn't exactly like Lightroom, but its user interface 
certainly looks similar: it opens to a central film strip display area, 
surrounded by control panels that can be popped in and out. There's
an intensity histogram in the top-right corner, with tagging controls
just below it. This view is called the 'light table' in Darktable, and
is the main interface for organization.
</p>
<p>
There's also a non-destructive editing interface, just like the one
Lightroom provides. 'Non-destructive' means that the changes are applied on
top of a source image, which is not changed in any way.  Both Lightroom and
Darktable work best with raw image formats, rather than photos that have been
processed into common formats like JPEG. However, both can handle JPEGs, at a
pinch.
</p>
<p>
Both applications support all the raw image formats I've tried --
Sony, Nikon, Fujifilm.... I've had to upgrade Lightroom
over the years, to keep up support for the latest formats. Darktable
just reads all my raw files without complaint -- but it's more 
up-to-date than the Lightroom version I have.
</p>
<p>
Darktable and Lightroom use very similar terminology, and follow a
similar workflow. Very little in Darktable should be surprising to a 
long-term Lightroom user. Both applications can produce great 
results if you take sufficient care, or acceptable results if you're 
in a hurry. 
</p>
<p>
Darktable has one other striking similarity to Lightroom: it gets slower
and less reliable over a long period of usage. Both applications need
periodically to be restarted, to restore proper function.
</p>

<h2>How Darktable is unlike Lightroom</h2>
<p>
My impression is that Darktable is more focused on editing than Lightroom is,
while Lightroom focuses more on organization.  If that's correct, it's
understandable, because Lightroom is tightly integrated with other Adobe photo
editing products like Photoshop.  
</p>
<p>
For my purposes, Lightroom's organizational features are more
comprehensive than Darktable's. For example, Lightroom provides 
comprehensive support for virtual collections. You can define a complex
hierarchy of collections, some of which are maintained by manually selecting
photos, while others are selected automatically, based on tags or other image
characteristics.  Why is this a big deal? I organize my raw input images
strictly by date. All the photos I take on one day go into a directory with
that date. If all the photos are from a specific shoot, then I use a directory
name as well.  However, my main file organization is one directory per day.
</p>
<p>
When I export my photos into a viewable format, however, I want a subject-based
hierarchy. Although it is time-consuming to set up the export directory
structure in Lightroom, once set up a complete export is a one-click
operation.  If I want to export to a photo-sharing site like Flikr this, too,
is a one-click operation. Lightroom won't export photos that
have not changed since the last export, so keeping the raw image files and
the viewable files in sync is trivial and quick. Darktable doesn't
export to photo-sharing sites (for better or worse) and its export operation
is always exhaustive (and slow).
</p>
<p>
Darktable allows virtual collections to be created using image characteristics
and tags, but its structure is flat, not hierarchical. Worse, there is no way
(that I have found) to create a collection from arbitrary, user-selected
files. Suppose I wanted to create a collection of, for example, 
photos containing
sunsets. With Lightroom I can define the collection, browse or search the
whole image collection, and just pick out the images I want. To do this 
in Darktable I would have to assign a specific 'sunset' tag to the
photos I want, and then include them in the collection based on that tag. This
works fine, but requires more forward planning. I find that, with Darktable, I
have ended up with hugely more tags than I ever used with Lightroom. If you
have hundreds of virtual collections, with no hierarchical structure, the 
list won't fit onto the screen, which makes selecting items from a menu
rather tedious.
</p>
<p>
Darktable lacks many of the simple, convenience features that make Lightroom so
productive for organization. For example, Lightroom recognizes the tags I use
most often, and presents these in a specific panel, so my most useful tags are
never more than one mouse click away.  If I change the contents of one my
source directories, in Lightroom I just click the 'synchronize' menu, and any
new photos are imported automatically into the catalogue. Then Lightroom
creates a new collection labeled, 'Previous import', so I can see all these
photos in one place. If I want to add a single photo to an existing directory
in Darktable, I have to find the specific 'film roll' collection which
relates to the directory containing the new image, then repeat the
import process, then find where in the film roll the new photos have ended up. 
</p>
<p>
This isn't a problem if you only add photos in bulk, one directory at a time,
and never add or change any other file. To be fair, that's mostly how I work.
It's just a nuisance on those few occasions when I do need to add photos to an
existing directory.
</p>
<p>
Then there are many small, unaccountable lacks in Darktable's user interface.
For example, in 'light table' mode, you can step through photos using the
arrow keys. In 'darkroom' mode, even though a film strip is displayed at the
bottom of the window, you can't select images from it using keystrokes -- you
have to click the mouse. Maybe this is something that is configurable --
everything is configurable in Darktable -- but it seems bizarre that this is
not something that just works. If I select a specific photo in the 'light
table' mode, then use the mouse wheel to zoom the display, Darktable resets to
the first photo in the collection, and zooms that, rather than the selected
photo. Why? I can only imagine
this is a bug -- I can't see why working this way would ever be useful. 
</p>
<p>
Editing photos is superficially similar between the two applications, but
differences become apparent after even a few minute's use.
 Darktable allows <i>much</i> more
fine-grained control of all image-processing operations 
than Lightroom does. Consider noise reduction, for
example. Lightroom has (so far as I can tell) a single noise-reduction
method, with three adjustment sliders. Darktable makes many different 
methods available, and some have dozens of adjustments. There's no easy
way to know which method will be most effective, nor any obvious way to
learn which adjustments are most productive, except by hours of practice.
If you're willing to put in the time, Darktable's noise reduction produces
splendid results, and the same applies to many of the other image
editing steps. However, it seems that little attention has been paid
to user convenience.
</p>
<p>
For example, consider a commonplace editing operation like red-eye removal.
Lightroom has a built-in red-eye removal tool, that requires no user
intervention beyond roughly selecting the photo areas that contain eyes. The
software works out where the red areas are, and converts them to black,
retaining catchlights and a bit of texture. Darktable has (so far as
I know) no automated red-eye removal process. You <i>can</i> remove red-eye
very effectively, using one of a number of the general-purpose editing tools,
like desaturation or colour-channel adjustment. However, this is a manual
process -- you have to draw around the red areas using simple shapes or
paths, creating a mask. Then you have to desaturate or otherwise adjust
the masked area. And each eye has to be done in turn.
</p>
<p>
If I want to edit one or two photos, and get impeccable results, Darktable's
approach works best. Given time, I can get better results that I ever have
with Lightroom alone. Darktable is way better than Lightroom at salvaging
photos that appear to be unusable.  However, if I have dozens or hundreds of
photos to process, Lightroom's one-click approach to common tasks is more
productive. 
</p>
<p>
Trying to use Darktable in a hurry leads to beating my head on the desk. For
example, if I have a noisy image, and I really want to get the best noise
reduction possible, I can try all the various methods that Darktable offers,
and experiment with all the various tuning parameters. However, if I want to
apply noise reduction to a hundred photos from a single shoot (and sometimes I
do), Lightroom's less effective method is usually good enough, and enormously
faster to apply.
</p>
<p>
These differences are mostly minor, and not show-stoppers.  But there are two
really <i>huge</i> differences between the Lightroom and Darkable user
interfaces that I simply can't overlook.  First, the Lightroom user
interface is <i>really</i> fast. Operations that I do repeatedly, like
rotating an image to level the horizon, are effortless in Lightroom. The
display moves in real time in response to changes in the adjustment controls.
With Darktable, each screen redraw takes a second or two. Real-time
adjustments are a non-starter, even for simple operations like changing the
tone curve.
</p>
<p>
The other big difference -- and this one is close to being 
a show-stopper for me -- is
that Darktable has no dual-monitor support. With Lightroom I can, for example,
use one monitor to show the collection as a film strip, while
viewing or editing a selected photo on a different monitor. Or I can show the
same image on two different monitors with different color profiles, to
get an idea how the image will look on different display devices. Or,
when editing, 
display the 'before' and 'after' versions on different monitors. 
I've raised this on the Darktable forums in the past, and it's been difficult
to convince the maintainers that I couldn't get the behaviour I wanted,
simply by using a larger monitor. It isn't the size of the monitor that
matters, but the ability to display different things in different places.
Darktable strictly uses one window for its entire scope of operations.
I've found ways to work around this limitation -- including buying a 
very large 4K monitor -- but it hasn't been easy, and I really miss the
dual-monitor support of Lightroom.
</p>

<h2>Why I moved to Darktable</h2>
<p>
I own the last version of Lightroom that could still be purchased
outright. It has served me well for many years, but recently I tried to
load raw images from a camera I hadn't used before, and found that its
raw format wasn't supported by Lightroom. 
</p>
<p>
I couldn't upgrade or patch Lightroom -- it's no longer available to buy.
I'd have to sign up for a monthly subscription, and there's no way
I'm ever going to do such a thing. And, of course, now that I don't use
Windows for anything except editing photos, a Linux-based alternative
was increasingly attractive.
</p>
<p>
If Lightroom were free, and ran on Linux, I would still be using it. Frankly, 
 I would probably still be using Lightroom even if it were expensive,
so long as it was a one-time purchase. However, there's no sign that
Lightroom will ever support Linux and, although I can run it in a virtual
machine, I lose the dual-monitor support, and I'm not sure how colour
calibration works in such a mode. 
</p>
<p>
My move to Darktable has thus been a very reluctant one. Moving my entire
photo collection to Darktable -- including all the edits and metadata -- has
been a long, slow process, which I will probably never complete fully.
In principle, Lightroom can write XMP 'sidecar' files that Darktable
can read. This means that Darktable can replicate at least some of the
editing operations I formerly made using Lightroom. However, forcing
Lightroom to write XMP files retrospectively (this is not enabled by
default) is slow, and not entirely reliable. And not everything that
Lightroom can do is actually saved in the XMP file. So a full, automated
import of a large photo collection -- and mine spans decades -- from
Lightroom to Darktable is probably impossible.
</p>
<p>
It's undeniable that Darktable produces excellent results, if you have time to
tweak and experiment. If each image has to be perfect, down to the pixel
level, Darktable makes that possible. However, Lightroom produces acceptable
(to me) results in a fraction of the time. The user interface is more
intuitive, although I can't deny that I might have just adapted myself to it
over many years. Nevertheless, <i>everything</i> in Lightroom is faster than
Darktable -- sometimes much faster. I don't just mean faster to find the
relevant user interface control, but faster to compute and redraw the display. 
</p>
<p>
I have to confess that I do like the fine control that Darktable offers, and
operations like noise reduction and parametric masking in Darktable are
streets ahead of anything that Lightroom -- and least my version -- 
offers. In practice, I rarely do the
kind of detailed editing where these features are necessar -- I often
want to do basic editing (exposure, colour balance, cropping...) on several
hundred photos in one sitting, which is where Lightroom excels.  
</p>
<p>
It's hard to beat Darktable's pricing model -- you can't get much
cheaper than free. I didn't pay for it, and I didn't contribute to it
in any way, unless you count complaining on the forums. It's therefore
churlish and unreasonable to find fault with it. 
It also seems churlish to compare Darktable unfavourably with Lightroom,
when Darktable is explictly stated not be a a replacement for Lightroom. 
But this is, in fact, how Darktable seems to be viewed; 
if an application
isn't productive for me, there needs to be a compelling reason to
use it, even if it's free. 
</p>
<p>
It turns out that Linux support <i>is</i> that compelling reason.  In
practice, I find that Darkable is an acceptable alternative to
Lightroom for most applications, and a superior one for a few. 
For operations that are slow in Darkable, I just grit my teeth and
try not to get annoyed.
On balance, I prefer Lightroom; and if I weren't
a Linux user, and only financial considerations were in play, the decision
would be harder. However, I object strongly to subscription-based
pricing and, most likely, I would have stopped using Lightroom even 
if Linux support wasn't so important to me.
