<h1>Using a shift register to control eight digital outputs with three GPIO lines on the Raspberry Pi</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/chip.png" 
  alt="Pi logo"/>
For some applications, it's a problem that the Raspberry Pi has only ten 
general-purpose digital output pins on its GPIO header (or even 20, if
you can re-use the special-purpose pins). This article describes a simple
way to control eight digital outputs with three GPIO pins, using a
shift register. Although I only describe how to provide eight
outputs, the technique can easily be expanded to provide any number
of outputs, by chaining shift registers together.
</p>
<p>
There's nothing new about this method but, as always, I'll be explaining 
how it works in detail, without using poorly-documented code hidden 
in libraries. 
I'll be showing snippets of C code, but not a full application. 
The full application is available
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/74hc595">in my GitHub repository</a>.
I'll also be explaining the limitations of the technique, and pitfalls
that arise when using it.
</p>


<h2>What is a shift register?</h2>
<p>
A shift register is a component that converts small blocks of data
(typically one bit) into larger blocks of data. The 74HC595 is an 8-bit
shift register, meaning that it takes one bit at a time, and assembles the
bits into an 8-bit register. Each of the 8-bits in the register has its
own pin on the chip, so each can be used to provide an independent digital
output. The full  
<a href="https://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/MC74HC595-D.PDF">datasheet</a>
of the chip is here. 
</p>
<p>
In general, we need three digital signals to drive a traditional shift
register like the 74HC595 (perhaps four -- see below). 
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
The <i>data</i> line holds the bit that is to be read into the register.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The <i>clock</i> or <i>shift</i> line tells the register when a new bit is
available to be shifted in.
</p></li>
<li><p>
A <i>latch</i> line tells the register that all the data has been provided,
and the chip should transfer it to the outputs. 
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Each of the data, shift, and latch lines needs a GPIO pin. In my circuit
diagram and sample code I use GPIO pins 17, 22, and 27, simply because
they are next to one another on the header, and not used for anything
else.
</p>
<p>
It's possible to use a different kind of shift register for input 
rather than output: such a register would latch the inputs, and then
shift them into the microcontroller one bit at a time.
</p>
<p>
Shift registers like the 74HC595 can be <i>chained</i>. If you send nine
bits to an 8-bit shift register, the first bit sent "rolls over" the end
of the register. The chip has a pin that represents the 0/1 state of the
bit that rolled over, and this can be fed into another shift register's
data input.
All the shift registers in the chain have the same data and latch
signals from the controller. So we could send 24 bits (say) to three
8-bit registers, by sending the roll-over output from each register
to the input of the next in the chain, and operating 
the shift pin 24 times, with one
latch at the end.
</p>
<p>
The 74HC595 has a single-unit price of about 50p in the UK. It can be
powered directly by a 3.3V supply, with its control lines connected
directly to the Pi's (~3V) GPIO pins. What you probably <i>can't</i> do
-- not reliably, at least -- is power the shift register from 5V, to
get 5V outputs, while still using ~3V inputs. Looking at the data
sheet (see "DC electrical characteristics") we see that the minimum
high input voltage lies between 3.15 and 4.2 V with a 5V supply --
that's a bit too close for comfort.
</p>
<p>
There is a price to be paid (isn't there always?) for all this convenience. 
We can't keep multiplying our digital output provision by a factor
of eight without losing something else. <i>What we lose is speed</i>. 
Because
the data has to be clocked out of the Pi one bit at a time, and we
need to clock in the whole eight bits to make one change, changing
a single bit in the register is approximately eight times slower than 
changing a single GPIO pin. 
</p>


<h2>A simple circuit</h2>
<p>
The diagram below shows the simple test circuit.
Note that the digital outputs will have a high (binary 1) voltage of about 3V, 
roughly
the same as the GPIO pins on the Pi. So these outputs can be used in
more-or-less any place the original Pi outputs could. 
A simple test would be to connect the outputs to 0V via a 220 
ohm (or thereabouts) resistor.
</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p>
Note that this circuit will power up with <b>all outputs high</b>.
The initial state is, so far as I can see, not documented --
they are all high in my tests, but probably this can't be relied on.
Consequently,
if the startup state is critical, you'll have to find a way to force
the outputs to a specific state until the controller has had chance to
set the initial output values. The ENABLE input (pin 13) can be used for
this purpose. In my simple test circuit, I have this pin pulled low, so
the outputs are always enabled. With this pin high, the outputs will be in a
high-resistance state, so they can be pulled high or low using suitable
pull-up or pull-down resistors. 
</p>
<p>
You can connect the ENABLE pin to another GPIO pin, or to some simple
timing circuit that provides a delay. It's worth bearing in mind that,
if you use a GPIO pin, these pins are themselves in an unspecified state
when the Pi starts up. So, by itself, that might not be a solution. 
What <i>is</i> a solution depends on how critical the start-up state is --
if you're controlling the cooling system for a nuclear reactor, you'll
need to be more careful about this, than if you're just switching
indicator lamps.
</p>

<h2>The code</h2>
<p>
Here is the important part of the C code that sets a new value to the
shift register.

</pre>

<p>
The function <code>gpiopin_set()</code> sets a specific value to the
GPIO pin -- I'm not describing that function here -- setting GPIO pins
is well-documented,
and you can look in the complete source code if you need the details.
</p>
<p>
What's important in the code is the sequence of events, which matches
the explanation I gave earlier. I use the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> 
operator to shift the value of <code>val</code> down, so that 
the least-significant
bit of <code>val</code> eventually becomes 
"bit 7" in the output, and the most significant
bit in <code>val</code> becomes "bit 0". With this 
mode of operation, you have to think
of the outputs being numbered in the opposite order from that which we
usually use. If this is a problem, we could just shift the bits
of <code>val</code> onto the data pin in the opposite order.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
I mentioned earlier that the fastest a value can be changed in the shift
register is about one eighth the speed at which the GPIO pins can be
changed. That's <i>sort of</i> true, but it's worth thinking about 
what that means in practice. 
</p>
<p>
It turns out that, with my test circuit and code, it takes about 1msec 
to set a specific bit in the shift register. Looking at the datasheet
for the 74HC4595, it appears that we ought to be able to clock in values
hundreds of million times per second. We <i>should</i> be able to read
in eight bits in a microsecond. So why can't we?
</p>
<p>
The problem lies in the timing precision of the Pi kernel. Whatever
value is supplied to the <code>usleep()</code> function, the smallest
delay we can get is about 0.1 msec. Note that this is an <i>idle</i>
delay -- during that time, the CPU can do other things (if it has other
things to do). If we implement a <i>busy</i> delay, where the CPU just
cycles pointlessly for a fixed number of clock cycles, we can get much
smaller delays -- unless the kernel happens to interrupt the busy loop
to service another task. 
</p>
<p>
The same, of course, applies to changing the states of the GPIO pins. 
That's why it's <i>sort of</i> true that it takes about eight times as
long to change a value in the shift register as to change a GPIO
pin -- I'm assuming we're using the same timing method for both.
</p>
<p>
What I'm trying to explain, in my rather ham-fisted way, is that a standard
Raspberry Pi kernel isn't ideal for controlling precise, high-speed
timing operations. There are nasty ways to get more precise timings
-- if we don't mind burning CPU for nothing -- but they aren't ideal
in a multiprocessing kernel. The relatively relaxed pace of 
1msec per output change will at least be reliable. 
</p>
<p>
If should also be clear that, although we can extend the number of outputs
almost indefinitely by chaining shift registers together, each new 
shift register in the chain adds another millisecond or so to the 
time required to set a specific output to a new state. 
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
A simple shift register circuit can easily expand the digital output
provision of a Raspberry Pi, but at a cost. Most obviously, to change
a single output pin requires shifting in a whole set of values, which
takes time. The extra time required is particularly unavoidable on
multiprocessing systems, like the standard Pi kernel, which don't have
fine timing control. In addition, some thought has to be given to
ensuring that the outputs start up in the correct state when the system
powers up.
