<h1>Using a CP/M machine to log into a Linux server using an RS232 connection</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/terminal.png" 
  alt="terminal prompt"/>
Because -- why not?
</p>
<p>
Also, this is a good test that the serial communications ports and cables are working
properly. The objective here is to use my CP/M system, which is based on the RC2014 bus,
to operate a Linux server using RS232. It's a reasonable place to start
fiddling with serial communications, because we know that Linux will support terminal
sessions over a serial connection -- although this can be a little fiddly to set up. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>System set-up</h2>
<p>
The diagram below shows the test configuration. 
</p>
<p aign="center">
<img src="img/kermit1.png" alt="Diagram of the system set-up" width="650px"/>
</p>
<p>
The CP/M system has its serial console port connected to a terminal emulator 
(which is a self-contained unit based on a Raspberry Pi 3, but that's not really important).
The second serial port is connected via a serial cable to the Linux machine which, since 
modern PC-type hardware doesn't have a real serial port, uses a USB-serial adapter. 
At the Linux level, this serial connection appears as <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code>. Most 
USB-serial adapters are supported by modern Linux distributions without additional software
or configuration.
</p>
<p>
All the 'RS232' lines in this diagram are actually using 5V TTL logic levels, not real
RS232 (which typically uses 12V). In a simple test like this, there's no point adapting the
logic levels to real RS232 and back again. Of course, to use a 'real' RS232 device, like a 
serial printer, you'd need a level converter.
</p>

<h2>The CP/M system</h2>
<p>
The system I'm using has a Z180-based main board with two serial ports. One of these is used
for the main user console, while the other is unassigned. This second serial port appears
in CP/M as <code>UC1</code> ("user console 1"), among other things. 
</p>
<p>
The CP/M system uses ROMWBW firmware, which supplies a CP/M utility <code>mode</code> for setting
the serial port properties (baud rate, etc). This utility is specific to the CP/M implementation
-- other firmwares will have their own ways of setting up ports. Within the <code>mode</code>
utility, the second serial port is referred to as <code>COM1</code>.
</p>
<p>
I'm using Kermit on CP/M to make the connection, although ROMWBW supplies a simple utility
<code>talk.com</code> which will actually work fine for this simple test. I've been using
Kermit because it's supposed to support software flow control (of which, more later).
CP/M Kermit exists in various versions for particular hardware. I'm using the 'generic'
version, which should work on any CP/M whose BIOS has <code>IOBYTE</code> support. That is,
it has the ability to redirect the standard console to auxiliary hardware. Because
Kermit can be slightly awkward to build, 
here is a binary of <a href="cpm/kerm411.com">Generic Kermit 4.11 for CP/M</a>.
</p>
<p>
The fastest baud rate I've been able to use reliably is 19200. To set the serial port to
use this baud rate, I do:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
B> mode com1 19200
</pre>

<h2>The Linux system</h2>
<p>
My Linux system is running Fedora which, for better or worse, uses <code>systemd</code> to
control log-in access to serial terminals. To start a log-in listener on the USB-serial port, I 
use <code>systemctl</code> as follows: 
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
# setenforce 0
# stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 19200 
# systemctl start getty@ttyUSB0
</pre>
<p>
<code>setenforce 0</code> turns off SELinux security enforcement, which might not be a good plan
in a production system. This is only necessary because of a bug (sigh) in the <code>systemd</code>
implementation in my version of Fedora -- other systems might not need this measure.
</p>
<p>
It's necessary to set the baud rate before starting the listener -- I've noticed that if I
do it later, it appears to change but, in fact, does not. 
</p>
<p>
For the record, what <code>systemctl</code> actually ends up doing is to run <code>agetty</code>,
like this:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
agetty -o -p -- \u --noclear ttyUSB0 vt220
</pre>
<p>
<code>agetty</code> is a modern, cut-down version of the traditional Unix <code>getty</code>, which
listens for serial connections, and invokes <code>login</code> to start a user session. The way
that <code>systemd</code> invokes <code>agetty</code> can be modified by hacking on various
<code>systemd</code> configuration files, but the default behaviour is fine for simple
testing.
</p>

<h2>Logging in</h2>
<p>
With <code>agetty</code> running on the Linux system, and both systems configured to use the
same (low-ish) baud rate, it's just a matter of running <code>kerm411</code> on the CP/M
system, and typing CONNECT at the prompt. Here is a screenshot of a log-in session, just
to demonstrate that it actually works.
</p>

</p>

<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>
I expected to have problems with terminal compatibility but, in fact, I did not.
I feel that it's only fair to point out that this is because I'm 
using a Linux-based terminal emulator with my CP/M system.
By default, Linux assumes that the terminal -- whether it's a real terminal or just an
on-screen console -- is broadly VT100 compatible. 
</p>
<p>
The heyday of CP/M predates the VT100, really. If I weren't using a VT100-compatible terminal emulator,
but a real serial terminal of earlier vintage, things would be a little more complicated. However,
Linux has wide terminal support so, provided I use a supported terminal, probably all I need
to do in Linux is to set the <code>TERM</code> environment variable to match the terminal
I'm using. So, in fact, terminal compatibility isn't really a problem at all.
</p>
<p>
What definitely <i>is</i> a problem, however, is the lack of hardware flow control in the 
serial port. My Z180-based main board has full flow control in the console port, but no
flow control in the second serial port. This, I'm told, is a limitation of the Z180.
</p>
<p>
I've been using Kermit for communications because it's documented as supporting software
(XON/XOFF) flow control. This should be a viable alternative to hardware flow control but,
in practice, it doesn't seem to work very well. If the Linux system sends a large amount
of data to the CP/M system (and 'large' here depends on the baud rate), some characters
get dropped. I suspect that the Linux system is so fast, compared to the CP/M system that,
by the time the CP/M system sends its 'XOFF' to pause transmission, the Linux system has
already sent a heap of data.  Whatever the explanation, I can't get baud rates greater
than 19200 to behave well. To be fair, it I were using a long serial connection
between the two computers, or a telephone modem of 1980's vintage, I probably wouldn't be able to get
speeds much faster than that anyway.
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
I can't think of many good reasons to use a CP/M system as a front end to a Linux server -- especially
when the CP/M system has its own Linux-based terminal. Still, it's good to know that ancient
technologies can, to some extent, be used with modern ones.
