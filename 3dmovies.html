<h1 id="they-dont-make-em-like-that-any-more-3d-movies">They don’t make
’em like that any more: 3D movies</h1>
<p><img src="img/movieclip.jpg" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>I’ll watch <em>anything</em> in 3D. I even enjoyed <em>The Phantom
Menace</em> in 3D and, frankly, the 3D effects were the only good thing
about that movie. Around 2015 I thought about converting my home A/V
set-up for 3D. I already had a wall-sized screen and seven-channel
sound, but I didn’t have 3D. I’m kind-of glad I didn’t, though – by 2015
the golden age of 3D movies was already over, though we didn’t know it
at the time. Perhaps we should have guessed – this wasn’t the first time
3D had exploded with a fanfare onto our screens, and the previous time
it hadn’t stuck around long.</p>
<p>But, no: in 2015 everybody thought that 3D was the future of the
movie industry, the one thing that could save it from the inexorable
rise of streaming television. Studios were tripping over themselves to
throw new 3D releases into cinemas, and cinema-goers were yumming them
up. Movie studios and cinemas glommed onto 3D because it offered
something that television could not – well, not easily, anyway.</p>
<p>But right now my local movie theatre, which has twenty screens, is
not showing a single 3D movie. It’s two years since it screened a 3D
release that I wanted to watch.</p>
<p>So what happened? How did a technology that everybody told us was
going to be the salvation of the movie industry fail so comprehensively,
so quickly?</p>
<p>An obvious limitation was that not everybody liked 3D. A substantial
number of viewers said it gave them a headache, or made them nauseous. I
never had that experience, but my wife did. I can fully understand that,
if you go to the cinema to be entertained, you’re not going to be happy
if you’re nauseated instead. I find the special 3D glasses a minor
nuisance, but I’m used to wearing spectacles, so the extra weight on my
nose isn’t all that annoying. For some people, I guess, it might be.</p>
<p>A more substantive problem, though, was that in their rush to produce
3D movies, studios often didn’t make them very well. Relatively few
movies were produced with a full 3D workflow: more often they were
filmed with conventional 2D equipment, and then converted. <em>Phantom
Menace</em> was actually a 3D conversion of the original 2D movie, which
had been released ten years earlier. It wasn’t a great conversion,
either; it had a distinctly ‘layered’ look, like a kid’s pop-up book.
Many of the fast action sequences worked well enough, but I get the
impression that the studio didn’t really know what to do with the
slower, dialogue scenes. To be fair, such scenes don’t really benefit
much from a 3D presentation, but scenes still have to be rendered in 3D
if it’s a 3D movie.</p>
<p>And then there was the cost. To get a natural 3D effect, studios had
to use specialist equipment, like James Cameron’s <em>Fusion Camera
System</em> that gave us the <em>Avatar</em> movies. And, um… <em>Yogi
Bear</em>. This kind of equipment is expensive and requires specialist
operators, as well as more sophisticated and time-consuming editing and
post-production. This expense was passed on to consumers and, by 2015,
we cinema-goers were starting to feel we’d seen it all before. It wasn’t
clear to me now, and still isn’t, whether <em>Yogi Bear</em> needed full
3D. To be fair, the ‘Jellystone’ scenery was very impressive in 3D, but
it doesn’t really add much to the overall presentation. If you don’t
find a gluttonous, talking bear funny in 2D, you’re probably not going
to laugh when he’s in 3D, either. But showing his antics in 3D added to
the ticket price.</p>
<p>Eventually, cinema-goers started to feel that seeing objects flying
towards them out of the screen was getting a bit passé, particularly
when it made a night at the movies more expensive. It was even a little
irritating, that the studios planned movies around opportunities to use
these gimmicks, rather than the development of the story.</p>
<p>We should have predicted this. It turns out that the rise and fall of
3D technology between 2010 and 2020 echoed the similar trajectory that
it followed between 1950 and 1960, and for similar reasons. As now,
studios were seeking ways to distance themselves from television. The
technologies they used to create 3D movies in the 50s weren’t all that
different from the ones we use today – except that they’d <em>had</em>
to film in 3D: the computer technology needed to convert a 2D production
to 3D wasn’t available at that time.</p>
<p>In the 50s there were two main 3D technologies, both of which
required the viewer to wear special glasses – as is the case today. Both
these technologies have the effect that each of the viewer’s eyes sees
an image filmed from a slightly different position. ‘Anaglyph’
technology worked using coloured filters, with images from two different
viewpoints tinted in colour. ‘Polarization’ technology uses filters that
pass light preferentially when it is polarized in a particular way,
different for each viewpoint. Almost all modern 3D movies use
polarization methods, although it’s possible now for cinemas to use a
single, specialized projector that shows both polarizations in alternate
frames. For this to work, there needs to be a filter that can switch
polarities tens or hundreds of times each second, which is a relatively
new development. Nevertheless, its the same basic principle, and the
same customer experience: we’re still wearing glasses that show
different images to each eye.</p>
<p>As in our more recent 3D boom, the movies of the 50s sometimes
focused on the 3D effects more than the storytelling. We’ve probably all
seen that scene where something releases a heap of balls that come
bouncing out of the screen. But I think of the ‘alien monster’ genre as
the exemplar of 50s 3D – even though the monsters were just as obviously
guys in rubber suits when they were in 3D. These were loud, garish
productions, played for cheap thrills. <em>Expensive</em> cheap
thrills.</p>
<p>Then, as now, not everybody liked 3D, or could even tolerate it. By
the late 50s, cinema-goers were reluctant to pay extra to see something
they increasingly regarded as a gimmick.</p>
<p>But it was CinemaScope that really finished off 1950s 3D. This
technology allowed for huge, wide-screen images, using lenses that could
easily be retro-fitted to existing cameras and projectors. Like 3D,
CinemaScope also allowed movie theatres to offer something that TV could
not. And, as its proponents never missed an opportunity to point out,
you didn’t have to wear special glasses to see it. The trend towards
larger and larger screens is also evident today.</p>
<p>So why were movie producers in the 2010s so keen on 3D, knowing that
the technology had already failed before? It isn’t even as if 3D
technology had changed all that much in preceding 50 years. The studios
didn’t do anything differently the second time around – they still
emphasized effects over storytelling, and they still used 3D for
productions that didn’t benefit from it. It seems that cinema-goers are
no more willing now to pay extra for a gimmick than they were in the
1950s. I can only imagine that the studios believed that 3D <em>in
combination with</em> contemporary computer graphics would offer
something that was not possible in the 50s.</p>
<p>Whatever the explanation, 3D isn’t completely dead. It’s plausible
that the next <em>Avatar</em> movie, <em>Fire and Ash</em>, for example,
will be shown in 3D. Whether that’s because the filmmakers have a real
commitment to the format, or because they started filming it in 2015,
I’m not sure.</p>
<p>Other than that, nearly all the 3D movies produced in the last few
years have been animated, because it’s no more expensive to produce 3D
animation than 2D. If your movie is produced entirely using computer
models, as the <em>Lego</em> movies are, then you can just run the
rendering process twice, with slightly different camera positions to
represent the two eyes of the viewer. It takes more computing power, for
sure, but that’s cheap these days.</p>
<p>I lament the passing (more or less) of 3D movies, although sometimes
I suspect that nobody else does. I still toy with buying 3D equipment
for my home, but I’m put off by the fact that I’ve already seen every
movie that was released in 3D, and there might not be any more. Which is
a shame.</p>
