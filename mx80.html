don’t make them like that any more: Epson MX-80 dot matrix printer</h1>
<p><img src="img/printer_logo.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>Epson released the MX-80 in 1980, before the company was even called
Epson. It was an immediate hit, and went on to become the best-selling
printer of the decade, despite not being cheap: its UK list price was
equivalent to about £2000 in today’s money.</p>
<p>The MX-80 was, I think, the last printer I didn’t hate.</p>
<p>Yes, it was slow and noisy, with unimpressive text quality. Any
throw-away laser printer from Staples will out-perform it in any way in
which performance can be measured, except one: hatefulness. We loathe
these modern printers with a passion, but we didn’t hate dot matrix
printers in the 80s.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Well, because they actually <em>worked</em>. And they went on
working, day after day, year after year. Modern printers are notorious
for letting us down when we most need them. Need that report tomorrow?
Tough. Printer manufacturers have responded to the declining sales of
their products, not by making them better, but by finding ways to scalp
their owners for the cost of consumables. And then, because consumers
naturally look for cheaper, 3rd-party suppliers of consumables, the
printer manufacturers retaliate by using encryption technologies to
prevent the printer accepting any consumables but OEM ones.</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard is even trying to move to a subscription model for
toner cartridges, so customers will have to pay by the month. It’s
telling that HP ran an advertising campaign using the slogan “Built to
be hated less”. We have to laugh, I guess, since the alternative is to
weep: everything HP has done recently makes us hate their printers more
and more.</p>

<p>Like most of the printers you can buy in Staples or PC World, the
MX-80 was designed for home or small business use, rather than heavy
commercial load. Unlike a modern printer, it came with a hundred-page
manual, clearly written by somebody who gave a damn. This manual
included details of connecting the MX-80 to popular computers of the
day, like the Tandy TRS-80, along with dozens of programming examples in
BASIC.</p>
<p>Although it was expensive to buy, the MX-80 was cheap to run – the
opposite situation from the one we find today. A replacement printer
ribbon cost about £5 in today’s money, and was good for about a million
characters. If even £5 were too expensive, I’m told you could re-ink the
ribbon – although, to be honest, I never saw this done successfully.
Even the print head was user-replaceable, which meant that the MX-80
could potentially last forever: there were few other moving parts.</p>
<p>Although it was sized for the desktop, and reasonably portable, the
MX-80 was a solid machine, that looked as if it were built to last. I
suspect that all the MX-80s ever made – those that haven’t ended up as
land-fill – would still work today. I still see one from time to time,
in a warehouse or a car inspection yard or something of that nature. You
can still buy replacement ribbons for them, and they still cost a
fiver.</p>
<p>Of course, the MX-80 wasn’t quiet or fast. It took about two minutes
to print a full page of text, and the noise was just appalling. The
sound of a 1980s dot matrix printer is immediately recognizable if
you’ve heard one, and indescribable if you haven’t. Many users bought,
or built, sound-proof boxes to operate them in, because otherwise the
noise was unbearable.</p>
<p>Although it wasn’t fast, the MX-80 did have some
performance-enhancing features that improved on its predecessors. For
example, it could print in both directions. That was a bigger deal in
1980 than it might appear, because bidirectional printing requires the
ability to buffer text and process it, which in turns requires some
computational ability. It also tried to calculate the fastest way to
seek the print head to the right place when feeding lines. Again, this
process requires a bit of intelligence, as well as a way to read
ahead.</p>
<p>The MX-80 only had a 9x9-pin print head, so it was never going to
offer letter quality. With that resolution it’s <em>just</em> possible
to print recognizable descenders (tails of letters like ‘g’ and ‘q’),
rather than raising the whole letter to the baseline. So it wasn’t the
worst print quality in the world. In general, though, text rendering was
pretty poor by modern standards, although perfectly readable.</p>
<p>The original MX-80 was designed for tractor-feed, fan-fold paper.
Once set up, the feed mechanism was rock-solid; it could print
unattended all night, and there was never a risk of jamming. There was a
friction-feed add-on for single sheets of plain paper, but I never used
it. The problem with fan-fold paper was that we had to separate the
individual sheets manually, and remove the perforated edges. This was a
tedious process, particularly with a long document, but that’s not the
fault of the printer.</p>
<p>I believe the MX-80 was the first printer to support a control
language: as well as accepting plain ASCII characters and a handful of
others, the computer could send codes to change the text size and
quality, and move the print head to a specific point. Eventually there
was a firmware upgrade that provided some limited dot graphics support,
again driven by control codes. With the right software – which you’d
probably have to write yourself – the MX-80 could plot graphs and render
photographs, newspaper-style. So far as I know, modern Epson printers
still accept the MX-80 control language, although they extend it.</p>
<p>In short, the MX-80 was the first, reasonably-affordable, completely
reliable printer designed for microcomputers. Later models in the same
series improved on the text quality – usually by using more pins on the
print head – and speed, but I’m not sure the robustness and reliability
were ever bettered.</p>
<p>I suspect that most computer users think that dot matrix printing is
obsolete – if they’ve ever even heard of it. Not so: they’re still used
in environments where absolute reliability is required. They’re
particularly good for filling in pre-printed forms, like MOT inspection
certificates. In fact, Epson still makes them. The LQ-350 is a very
similar machine to the MX-80 – still a 9-row print head, but with a USB
interface you wouldn’t have found in 1980. The newer model has less of
an industrial look, but that’s just the whim of fashion.</p>

</figure>
<p>Epson actually publishes service life expectations for its dot matrix
printers – I’ve not found comparable data for any modern laser printer,
and I suspect it would be shaming. The LQ-350 is rated at 10,000 hours
continuous printing duty: that amounts to an hour a day, every day, for
seventeen years. I’ve had modern laser printers that lasted only a
couple of years.</p>
<p>So, if printer manufacturers continue to throw away what little
goodwill their customers have left, I suspect that my next printer will
be a dot matrix.</p>
