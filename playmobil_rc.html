don’t make ’em like that any more: Playmobil RC model trains</h1>
<p><img src="img/playmobil_rc_logo.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>Ernst Paul Lehmann introduced the world to <em>Lehmann Gross
Bahn</em> (LGB) G-scale (“garden scale”) model railways back in the 60s.
LGB model trains were, and are, substantial enough for outdoor use,
running on track with a 45mm gauge. A typical locomotive weighs
1-2kg.</p>
<p>Despite their heft, most LGB models were finely detailed scale
replicas of real railway stock; they were, and remain, ruinously
expensive, and hardly suitable for small children. The exceptions are
the ‘starter’ sets, which can still be bought new for £200-300. Not
pocket change, to be sure, but the starter sets include a locomotive, a
few wagons, a circle of track, and a power transformer – enough to get
started playing trains outdoors. I’ve always wondered whether the
starter sets were a loss-leader for the manufacturer, sold at
less-than-cost price to entice people into the devastatingly expensive
world of garden railway modelling. Whether that’s true or not, I own a
couple of complete starter sets, and parts from others, and I’ve never
even considered buying any of the more expensive LGB locomotives. Not
that I could afford to.</p>
<p>In 1980, the Playmobil company – better known for its range of
rugged, all-pastic toys – joined forces with Lehmann to produce a range
of LGB-compatible toy trains for kids. The locos and coaches had the
same 45mm gauge and 22:1 scale as LGB, and were superficially similar in
appearance. However, the Playmobil rolling stock was definitely
toy-like: all plastic, with coarse detailing that could stand some abuse
from the little folk.</p>
<p>The original Playmobil train sets were supplied with LGB track, which
could be extended with other elements from the LGB range, if you were
wealthy enough. LGB track was, and still is, made of solid brass, with a
realistic cross-section, attached to separate, moulded sleepers. It
isn’t surprising that it’s so expensive. I presume that the intention
behind supplying LGB track was that the young owner of a Playmobil train
set would graduate in due course to running real LGB rolling stock on
the LGB track. Whether any did – presumably after selling a kidney – I
don’t know.</p>
<p>Like LGB, the first Playmobil locomotives were track-powered, using a
mains transformer. Playmobil transformers didn’t produce as high a
voltage as LGB transformers, although neither would be likely to deliver
an electric shock in dry conditions. However, the transformers weren’t
really designed for all-weather use, and could conceivably have been a
shock hazard if operated in the rain.</p>
<p>In addition, the track had to be kept scrupulously clean, including
the joints where sections of track butted together, as did the power
pick-ups on the locomotive. These might have been the metal wheels, or
separate spring-loaded pads that pressed on the track. If any of these
contacts were substandard, current couldn’t reach the motor, and the
train would stop. Serious adult modellers might have been willing to
spend the hours needed to keep their track in perfect running order, but
few children had that kind of dedication. Nor did I – I converted my LGB
locomotives to battery power as soon as it became practicable.</p>
<p>In 1987, Playmobil split with LGB, and decided to manufacture
complete garden train sets themselves. In place of the inconvenient and
potentially dangerous track power, their first home-grown sets were
battery-powered, with remote controls (hence “RC”). Instead of the
expensive, brass LGB track, the new sets were supplied with a
newly-designed, all-plastic track, whose rails and sleepers were moulded
in a single piece. Realism took a beating, to be sure, but the new track
was a fraction of the price of LGB’s product, more robust, and
maintenance-free.</p>
<p>As you can see from the photo below, Playmobil RC trains were clearly
toys, rather than collectable scale models.</p>
<p><img src="img/playmobil_rc_1.jpg" class="article-centre-image" /></p>
<p>The locomotives and coaches had lots of chunky moving parts for
little fingers to fiddle with, and they accommodated the popular
Playmobil mini-figures. The track maintained the LGB 45mm scale, but it
wasn’t backward-compatible: you couldn’t extend Playmobil RC track with
LGB track, even if you could afford to. In fact, annoyingly, Playmobil
RC locomotives wouldn’t run on LGB’s brass track at all, even though the
gauge was the same. Although you could push a Playmobil wagon around an
LGB track perfectly well, the locomotives would just sit and hum when
powered up. I’m guessing that the brass rails were just too slippery for
the Playmobil locos, which were much lighter than LGB ones. In fact,
most LGB locos have metal weights hidden inside, to increase the wheels’
friction on the tracks. Without these weights, the wheels just spin
pointlessly while the train stands still. Whatever the explanation,
Playmobil RC trains wouldn’t run on LGB track.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Playmobil’s plastic track still offered points, so
trains could be switched onto different sections of track. Unlike LGB
points, which had delicate, spring-loaded control mechanisms, LGB points
just had a big plastic knob to change them.</p>
<p>At its height, Playmobil offered a good range of models: modern
locomotives, steam locomotives in US and European pattern, passenger
coaches, goods wagons, track maintenance trucks, and buildings.</p>
<p><img src="img/playmobil_rc_2.png" class="article-centre-image" /></p>
<p>Because the locomotives’ bodies were separate from their motors, you
could use the motor with a custom-made body. I once made, for no better
reason than the joy of construction, a wooden locomotive body to fit a
Playmobil motor.</p>
<p>The RC locomotives were powered by a rechargeable battery pack that
slotted under the motor. These packs could be opened, with some
difficulty, to reveal four ordinary AA ni-cad batteries wired in series.
If these were left outdoors, they would self-discharge, and then burst,
turning the entire battery pack into a gloopy mass of green crystals. If
this happened when the battery pack was in the locomotive, you could
look forward to a happy evening dismantling it, and cleaning the
corrosion off the battery contacts with glasspaper.</p>
<p>In fact, the batteries were the weak point of the entire system. 4 AA
batteries would only run a train for about ten minutes, so you needed
multiple battery packs, and probably multiple chargers, to get the best
from the set. Still, neither the battery packs nor the chargers were
particularly costly.</p>
<p>Each set provided a chunky, hand-held radio controller, with a large,
friendly speed/direction knob. The controllers, too, were prone to
battery-related catastrophe, but were less likely than the locos to get
left in the garden with their batteries discharging.</p>
<p>In a splendid example of attention to detail, Playmobil supplied each
RC set with multiple band-setting crystals for the remote control. You
could thus run multiple sets independently in the same garden or, if you
were brave, multiple trains on the same track. The crystals were
colour-coded, so it was easy to figure out which controller handset went
with which locomotive.</p>
<p>Playmobil RC trains got sound features in 2010 but, by that time, my
kids were losing interest in trains, and we never had a sound-equipped
loco. Still, at the height of their enthusiasm, we did have about a
hundred metres of track, twenty pieces of rolling stock including three
locos, and a half-dozen batteries.</p>
<p>Happy days.</p>
<p>Other than the disaster-prone battery packs, Playmobil RC trains were
more-or-less indestructible, although they weren’t designed to be left
outdoors in the rain. My LGB trains lived outdoors through numerous
British winters, with no ill-effects; the Playmobil locos’ few metal
parts could corrode in those conditions.</p>
<p>Another problem was the track joiners. LGB track just slotted
together, and really needed to be secured to the ground in some way –
burying the sleepers in fine gravel was a popular method. Each piece of
Playmobil plastic track was a solid lump, and couldn’t be secured in
such a way. Instead, the track was supplied with small plastic
spring-clips which held the sections together. Well, it would have done,
if the clips hadn’t been so small that they just got trodden into the
mud, and never seen again.</p>
<p>Playmobil train sets were reasonably priced – certainly compared to
LGB – more-or-less child-proof, long-lasting, and great fun. And yet, by
about 2010, it was clear that sales were flagging. Playmobil stopped
production completely in 2015.</p>
<p>You can still buy Playmobil RC sets from online auctions, and they’re
not too expensive. However, before buying, it’s worth checking the
condition of the battery pack and the metal parts in the loco, as
they’re so prone to corrosion damage. Also, check that there are as many
track joiners as their are track pieces, because these are so easily
mislaid.</p>
<p>I suppose a 28-year production run isn’t bad for a toy, and I imagine
that Playmobil made a good return on their investment. Still, it’s
interesting to speculate why no comparable product now exists. So far as
I can see, kids still like trains, and they still like playing outdoors.
Playmobil RC trains were affordable, and could probably be made at lower
cost with contemporary manufacturing practices.</p>
<p>As the density of British housing increases, I guess fewer houses
have a garden, or even a yard; but outdoor space has never been
compulsory for playing trains. At one point, the entire ground floor of
my house was laid with track. Still, G-scale trains definitely need more
space than Hornby OO and the like.</p>
<p>The real reason for the demise of Playmobil RC might be, sadly, just
what Playmobil’s executives said it was: too many of today’s children
are more interested in video games than hands-on play, even when they’re
very young. Since many of my happiest memories are of playing trains
with my kids, I can’t help feeling a little sad about that.</p>
