<h1>Using the rdkafka library to integrate a C program with Kafka messaging</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/kafka_logo.png" 
  alt="Kafka logo"/>
The Kafka messaging platform is mostly associated with Java clients, but
users of other languages need not miss all the fun. <code>rdkafka</code> is
a set of libraries for C and C++ applications, supporting all the most
important features of Kafka, including transactions and encryption.
The library is maintained by Magnus Edenhill and others, and is loosely
associated with Confluent which, of course, is a company that is very
active in Kafka development. The Kafka client-server protocol is
completely proprietary, so a specific library will always be needed
for Kafka clients. 
</p>
<p>
This article provides a brief overview of <code>rdkafka</code> for
C, based on a trivially simple program that just sends a few
messages to Kafka. 
</p>
<p>
Binary versions of <code>rdkafka</code> are available for many Linux
versions, Windows, and MacOS. However, it should be possible to build
the library on any POSIX-like platform that has a C compiler. The
source code 
<a target="_blank"
 href="https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka">is available on GitHub</a>. 
</p>

<p>
In this article I focus on the C library. The C library can be used
with C++ programs but, of course, the converse is not true. Owing to the
way the C library is implemented, the C and C++ APIs are very similar.
The clean-up requirements are perhaps a bit easier to get right in the
C++ version but, frankly, there's not a lot else to choose between them.
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>Where I describe building the C program I'm mostly focusing on Unix-like systems. However, the rdkafka API itself is not platform-specific</blockquote>.

<p>
<code>rdkafka</code> is 
<a target="_blank" 
href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/clients/librdkafka/html/index.html">pretty well documented</a>, for an open-source project. However, the
sample programs use extra libraries which make them harder to follow
than they should be -- the C API is actually easier to use than the
examples make clear. In this article, I will describe how to code and
build the simplest Kafka C program I could think of: one that sends a 
couple of text messages to Kafka. This example does not support
authentication or encryption, so will probably need to be tested on a
local installation of Kafka. I might write another article covering
these features in due course, if there seems to be enough interest. 
</p>

<p>
I will give the describe source code for the simple
program only in outline.
 The full source code is available from 
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/kafka-c-trivial">my GitHub repository</a>.

</ul>

<h2>Overview of the rdkafka C library</h2>

<p>
<code>rdkafka</code> for C is implemented in a kind of object-oriented
C, a popular approach in modern C libraries. Data structures are
used to represent classes, each of which has a 'constructor' and a 
'destructor'. For example, we use the <code>rd_kafka_t</code> object,
which is the main entry point for both message production and consumption,
like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"> <font color="#008080">rd_kafka_t</font> <font color="#990000">*</font>producer <font color="#990000">=</font> <b><font color="#000000">rd_kafka_new</font></b> <font color="#990000">(...)</font> <i><font color="#9A1900">// Create the object</font></i>
 <b><font color="#0000FF">if</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>producer<font color="#990000">)</font>
   <font color="#FF0000">{</font>

   <b><font color="#000000">rd_kafka_destroy</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>producer<font color="#990000">);</font> <i><font color="#9A1900">// Call the destructor</font></i>
   <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
</pre>

<p>
"Methods" on these class-like structures are named after the 
class itself, and take a reference to the object as the first
paramter (which is what happens in C++, but invisibly).
So to use the <code>producer</code> object to send a message,
we can do:
</p>
<p>
<pre class="codeblock"> <b><font color="#0000FF">if</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>producer<font color="#990000">)</font>
   <font color="#FF0000">{</font>
   <b><font color="#000000">rd_kafka_producev</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>producer<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#990000">....)</font> 
   <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
</pre>
<p>
We can think of this usage as calling the "method" <code>producev()</code>
on the "class" <code>rd_kafka</code>. When I refer to "methods" in this
article, this what I have in mind. Of course, these are
really just C functions with a particular usage convention. 
</p>

<p>
Care needs to be taken with the clean-up of the "objects" allocated using
the API. In general, every object that is created needs to be cleaned
up; <i>but</i> some objects take ownership of other objects that are
passed to them. When that happens, the "owner" object will clean up
the dependent object when it, itself, is cleaned up. Trying to clean up
these dependent objects again will likely cause a crash. The 
<code>rdkafka</code> documentation is reasonably clear about the 
situations where this happens, and needs to be read carefully. 
</p>

<p>
As with any C program, it's well worth testing with a memory checker like
<code>valgrind</code>, because it's all too easy to miss some aspect of
clean-up, and end up with a nasty memory leak.
</p>

<h2>Initialization</h2>

<p>
Initialization is done in <code>rdkafka</code> in a very similar way to
the Java client. Producers and consumers have their own initialization,
based on name-value pairs. In <code>rdkafka</code> we create
an object of type <code>rd_kafka_conf_t</code>, and initialize it with
specific values, like this: 
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#008080">rd_kafka_conf_t</font> <font color="#990000">*</font>conf <font color="#990000">=</font> <b><font color="#000000">rd_kafka_conf_new</font></b><font color="#990000">();</font>
<b><font color="#000000">rd_kafka_conf_set</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>conf<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#FF0000">"bootstrap.servers"</font><font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#FF0000">"localhost:9092"</font><font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#990000">...);</font>
</pre>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>The ellipses [...] in these listings indicate places where I've left out code that is not necessary for the explanation; in this case it is related to error handling. Of course, the full source code does not omit these elements.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>"bootstrap.servers" is the only compulsory configuration setting. However, it's advisable to allow users to set other values, perhaps from a configuration file, as the exact settings for best performance often cannot be known at compilation time.</blockquote>

<p>
The <code>conf</code> object is then passed as an argument when creating
the <code>rd_kafka</code> object for producing messages.
</p>

<h2>Sending a message</h2>

<p>
There are various ways to send a message. The simplest is probably to call
<code>rd_kafka_producev()</code> which takes a topic name, a key, and
a value. This method will return very quickly because, in fact, it does
not wait for the message to be sent. The actual send happens asynchronously.
To wait for all pending sends to complete, we can do this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#000000">rd_kafka_flush</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>producer<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#993399">1000</font><font color="#990000">);</font> <i><font color="#9A1900">// milliseconds</font></i>
</pre>

<p>
If there is a problem communicating with the Kafka server, most likely it
is at this point it will become obvious -- messages will remain queued and
never get sent. We can check for this kind of error by testing the 
producer's queue length which, after seconds, ought to be zero:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#009900">int</font> unsent <font color="#990000">=</font> <b><font color="#000000">rd_kafka_outq_len</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>producer<font color="#990000">);</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">if</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>unsent <font color="#990000">&gt;</font> <font color="#993399">0</font><font color="#990000">)</font>
  <font color="#FF0000">{</font>
  <i><font color="#9A1900">// Handle error -- some messages are unsent</font></i>
  <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
</pre>


<h2>Error handling and logging</h2>

<p>
The <code>rdkafka</code> API uses a number of different error-handling 
mechanisms. First, there is the traditional return-value method that
is widespread in C programming. With this approach, a functional call
returns zero if it succeeds, and a number that indicates the cause
of the error if it does not. The
<code>rdkafka_producev()</code> method, for example, works this way.
The function <code>rd_kafka_err2str()</code> provides a textual representation
of the error code, if necessary. 
</p>

<p>
Some functions provide a textual error message directly. For example, the 
<code>rd_kafka_new()</code> function takes a <code>char *</code> as
an argument, along with an integer size argument. In the event of error,
the buffer that the <code>char *</code> references will be filled in
with text, up to the limit set by the length. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, the <code>rdkafka</code> library logs error conditions 
directly to <code>stderr</code>. A simple program, therefore, could get
along without doing any error reporting at all. Of course, it would
still have to test for errors, and take action accordingly. In a more
complex application, you'd probably want to capture the <code>rdkafka</code>
error messages, and combine them with other logging into a single 
reporting mechanism. The <code>rd_kafka_conf_set_log_cb()</code> sets a
new handler for library-generated log messages.
</p>

<h2>Compiling the simple C program</h2>

<p>
All that needs to be done, apart from the usual compilation steps, is
to link wth the <code>rdkafka</code> library. On Linux, for example: 
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
$ gcc -o myprog myprog.c -lrdkafka
</pre>


<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>
My test application writes to a particular topic on a particular
Kafka installation. To run it, you'd first need to edit the soure code
to define the Kafka bootstrap URI and the topic. Then you would need
some way to check that messages are actually being produced correctly.
For example, you could log into one of the Kafka broker hosts and
run <code>kafka-console-consumer.sh</code> directly, like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server :9092 --topic my-topic
Hello
World
...
</pre>

<h2>rdkafka licensing</h2>

<p>
<code>rdkafka</code> is an open-source library, made from components maintained
by different contributors. Its licence is a little more complex than will
be found in a project that is covered by a single, global licence like
GPL. All the components are licensed to allow distribution in source and
binary form, so in most cases this slight additional complexity won't
be a problem. However, it's probably advisable to read the various
licence documents in the source code, if you're planning a substantial
project based on <code>rdkafka</code>.  
</p>


<h2>Serializers and compatibility</h2>

<p>
If you're familiar with the Kafka client library for Java, you might be
struck by the lack of mention of <i>serializers</i> in <code>rdkafka</code>. 
Fundamentally, Kafka keys and values are just sequences of bytes -- 
Kafka does not impose any particular structure on them. It's up to the
clients to agree on how these bytes should be interpreted. This can be
problematic when the Kafka clients are based on different programming
platforms.
</p>
<p>
Java requires serializers because the internal representation of data
types in the JVM is opaque. For example, Java stores <code>String</code>
objects in a format that is based on UTF-16 encoding but, in fact, this
format is never directly exposed. To store a Java string in some other
location, external to the JVM, requires it to be converted to some
known format. So when we use the <code>StringSerializer</code> class in
a Java Kafka application, we're actually converting Java strings to
some other format. As it happens, this format is UTF-8. I stress that
this UTF-8 convention is imposed by the <code>client</code> -- Kafka does
not care how data is represented. 
</p>
<p>
The simple text program I have used for this article writes a string in,
essentially, ASCII format. ASCII is a subset of UTF-8 and, therefore,
a Java-based Kafka application would read the message payloads sent
by the C program correctly. UTF-8 is a good choice for a string
encoding, because it is so widely supported. However, I want to reiterate
that Kafka itself imposes <i>no</i> structure on the data it carries.
</p>
<p>
Java applications very often use <a href="avrotest.html">Apache Avro</a> 
to serialize complex data structures. Avro is widely used with Kafka,
and the Kafka client library for Java has built-in support for this.
An Avro library is also available for C, although it does not yet support
the same range of platforms that <code>rdkafka</code> does. The
problem is that C data types are not opaque, as Java's are: C developers
are used to working with raw data in memory. This means that
conversion from one platform to another, or even from one C compiler to
another on the same platform, is often problematic.
</p>
<p>
In short: unless your application is developed to work with raw bytes, 
you'll have to be careful to ensure that your Java and C applications
can use a common format for data representation. XML encoded with
UTF-8 is a pretty safe choice, but it's a lot less efficient than
Avro's binary encoding.
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>

<p>
If you're familiar with programming for Kafka in Java, you'll find few
surprises in <code>rdkafka</code> -- except, perhaps, the absence of
serializers. Even without that experience, <code>rdkafka</code> is
pretty easy to use -- at least for simple applications.
