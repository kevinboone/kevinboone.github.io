<h1>Using Keycloak for authentication with Apache Artemis: part 2</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/keycloak-logo-small.png" 
  alt="Keycloak logo"/>
</p>

<p>
In a <a href="artemis_keycloak.html">previous article</a> I described a 
minimal set-up for configuring the Apache Artemis message broker to authenticate
JMS messaging clients against Keycloak using OAuth2. The authentication flow
used in that 
article was the 'direct grant', which proceeds like this:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The JMS client provides its user ID and password to the Artemis
message broker </p></li>
<li><p>Artemis passes these credentials to Keycloak to validate </p></li>
<li><p>If the user is authenticated, Artemis uses the list of roles provided by Keycloak to determine what the user can do on the broker </p></li>
</ul>

<p>
This is a perfectly respectable way to do authentication, but the use of
long-lived user/password credentials on the wire is something that many
security administrators now want to avoid (more on this later). 
A more modern approach is to
use short-lived <i>bearer tokens</i>, which applications must periodically
renew, in order to continue their access. 
</p>
<p>
For JMS clients of Artemis, a token-based authentication flow 
looks like this: 
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The client sends some credentials to Keycloak (not to Artemis), 
and gets a bearer token
</p></li>
<li><p>The client sends this token to Artemis in place of a password
</p></li>
<li><p>Artemis verifies the token -- not the credentials -- against Keycloak
</p></li>
<li><p>When the token expires, the client asks for a new one, or issues a
renewal request on Keycloak
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
The use of bearer tokens is very common in web-based applications. A
user (usually a human, not a machine) directs a web browser at some
protected URL, and gets redirected to an authentication page. If authentication
is successful, the authentication system sets a bearer token in a cookie,
and the browser then re-tries the request. Because the bearer token is
now present, the service can pass it to Keycloak determine what the 
user's security roles are.
</p>

<p>
Bearer token authentication is less common in machine-to-machine interaction,
and the notion of redirecting to an authentication page has little meaning
here.  Still, we <i>can</i> use bearer token authentication in
machine-to-machine interaction -- we just have to provide some way for the
client software to get a bearer token, and some way for it to provide the
token to the
protected service. The latter requirement is relatively easy -- protected
services are used to getting user IDs, passwords, or certificates -- they
can usually be adapted to receive a token instead.  
</p>

<p>
In this article, I describe a minimal set-up for doing bearer token
authentication between a JMS client, Keycloak, and an Artemis message broker. 
The 
broker will already have been configured to use Keycloak for authentication,
if you followed the previous article.
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/><b>Important!</b> This article follows directly from the previous one, and assumes the same set-up. If you want to try the technique I describe here, I would strongly recommend reading the previous article, and setting up a test system as it describes. This article will not repeat any previous set-up</blockquote>

<h2>Why token-based authentication for Artemis?</h2>
<p>
Both the token-based and direct access approaches to authentication are 
reasonably secure, provided that
the credentials or tokens are themselves protected by an encrypted transport.
Token-based authentication is becoming more popular, however, as organizations
centralize their authentication. The great advantage of token-based 
authentication in a distributed enterprise is that <i>only the authentication system ever sees credentials</i>, which tend to be long-lived and
human-readable. Every other application in 
the enterprise sees only tokens, which
are short-lived. Direct access is fine, so long as every application or
system that needs to authenticate can be trusted with credentials.  
</p>
<p>
In this specific example, the use of bearer tokens means that the Artemis
broker never sees credentials. In normal operation the broker won't
expose, store, or log the credentials anyway; the risk that is averted is 
that of the broker doing this by accident, or its administrator doing it
maliciously.
</p>

<h2>Artemis set-up</h2>

<p>
In the previous article, I described how to set Artemis up using JAAS to
configure a <code>DirectAccessGrantsLoginModule</code>. This module is
the one that forwards the user's credentials to Keycloak for validation. 
</p>
<p>
The only change needed to user bearer token authentication is to 
enable the necessary JAAS module. This configuration is in 
<code>etc/login.properties</code>.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
activemq {
    org.keycloak.adapters.jaas.BearerTokenLoginModule required
      keycloak-config-file="${artemis.instance}/etc/keycloak-direct-access.json"
      role-principal-class=org.apache.activemq.artemis.spi.core.security.jaas.RolePrincipal
    ;
};
</pre>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>In all these examples, I'm only specifying one JAAS login module at a time. You can, and probably will, use multiple authentication mechanisms in a practical system. The JAAS configuration allows this, and you would probably specify the modules as <code>sufficient</code> rather than <code>required</code> in such cases</blockquote>

<p>
The file <code>keycloak-direct-access.json</code> is the same one I described
in the previous article -- we can use exactly the same Keycloak configuration
for direct-access (user/password) and bearer token clients. The contents
of this file were, and still are, as follows:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
{
  "realm": "foo",
  "resource": "artemis-broker",
  "auth-server-url": "http://localhost:8080/auth",
  "use-resource-role-mappings": true,
  "principal-attribute": "preferred_username",
  "ssl-required": "external",
  "credentials": {
    "secret": "foo"
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
The Keycloak client configuration was, and remains, "public", meaning that
no <i>additional</i> authentication is needed, to invoke the token-generating
API to get a token. Of course, this still needs to be done as a valid user,
using user/password credentials. In a practical set-up, you'd probably want
to create a 'confidential' Keycloak client, that has its own client ID and
client secret. This is not difficult, but it's beyond the scope of the
minimal set-up I'm describing here.
</p>
<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>I'm using the word 'client' in different ways here, because that's the terminology that everybody else uses. A JMS application is a client of the message broker, and the message broker is a 'client' of Keycloak. I'm sorry if that's confusing -- the problem is not really avoidable.</blockquote>
<p>
In short, broker set-up amounts to adding a new section to the JAAS
configuration to enable bearer token authentication. Everything else
in the broker, and Keycloak, remains the same.
</p>

<h2>Getting a token</h2>

<p>
When it wants to connect to the Artemis broker, the client application will
first go to Keycloak to get a bearer token. It will do this using an
HTTP request (or, more likely, HTTPS in a real installation). 
</p>
<p>
The request will specify the user (with password) for which a token
is required, the Keycloak client it is for, and (perhaps) the client
secret for that client. As I mentioned earlier, I'm not using client
secrets in this example, but the request will still have to contain 
a secret -- it will just be empty.
</p>
<p>
I'm not going to explain how to make an HTTP request using a messaging
client -- there are many ways to do this. You could use one of the many
libraries that handle this kind of request, or just code the HTTP
interaction at the network level. This is what the request will
look like on the wire:
</p>


<pre class="codeblock">
POST /auth/realms/foo/protocol/openid-connect/token HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Accept: */*
Content-Length: 89
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=artemis-broker&client_secret=&username=user1&password=user1&grant_type=password
</pre>

<p>
For testing purposes, we can make this request using a utility like <code>curl</code>:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ curl -d client_id=artemis-broker -d client_secret= \
    -d username=user1 -d password=user1 -d grant_type=password \
    localhost:8080/auth/realms/foo/protocol/openid-connect/token
</pre>

<p>
All being well, the response from Keycloak will be a JSON file that
has the following basic structure:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
{"access_token":"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiI.....", "expires_in":300, ...}
</pre>

<p>
The application will parse this JSON file, and extract the (very long)
token string. It should also parse the expiry time (which is in seconds),
and be sure to refresh the token, or request a new one, before this
time expires. It's important to remember that the client application
won't have any way to know whether its connection to the broker failed
because the credentials were incorrect, or whether the token had simply
expired.
</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>
You'll need to test that the authentication succeeds before the token
expires! For a simple test, any messaging client that accepts a 
user and password can be used. We will supply the long token string
as the password; the user ID can be anything.
</p>

<p>
Since we're configuring Artemis here, a simple -- but completely 
thorough -- test
is to use the <code>artemis</code> utility itself to connect to the broker.
For example:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ artemis producer --user dummy --password eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiI.....
</pre>

<p>
Naturally, authentication should fail if you supply a defective token.
It will also fail in five minutes even with the correct token, because
the token will have expired.
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>

<p>
In this article and the previous one, I've explained how we can configure
the Artemis message broker to authenticate against Keycloak, in two
different ways. 
</p>
<p>
In the first article, I described the 'direct grant' method, which requires
the Artemis client to send an ordinary user ID and password to the broker,
which in turn passes it to Keycloak to validate. In this article, I 
described how a client could go directly to Keycloak to get a bearer
token, and pass that to the Artemis broker instead of a user and password.
</p>
<p>
I do want to reiterate that these articles describe a minimal set-up. 
In practice, many more steps will be needed to ensure a thoroughly
secure installation.
