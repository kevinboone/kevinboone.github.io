don’t make them like that any more: Denshi block electronics kits</h1>
<p><img src="img/mosfet.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>I’ve been fascinated by electronics for as long as I can remember –
my interest certainly started before my parents would have trusted me
with a soldering iron or more than three volts. For a child to have such
an interest wasn’t that unusual back in the 70s: there wasn’t the same
barrage of passive entertainment available to children in those
pre-internet days. Without something to occupy our minds, my infant
friends and I would have been playing war games in the drainage
culverts, and risking drowning.</p>
<p>So, instead, from about the age of three I was trying to connect
bulbs and batteries with wires, just to see what would happen.
Eventually I moved on to transistors and resistors, but not integrated
circuits – not in those days.</p>
<p>For more sophisticated electronics experimentation of this kind, the
usual platform was a ‘spring clip’ electronics kit, of the kind sold by
Radio Shack (Tandy, in the UK) under the ‘Science Fair’ brand.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A typical spring-clip electronics kit;

</figure>
<p>In these kits the electronic components were fastened rigidly to a
baseboard, with their terminal brought out to spring clips. To carry out
experiments, we used lengths of wire to join the spring clips, following
detailed instructions. Each connection followed a route of a different
length, so the kits included pre-trimmed wires in various lengths. In
practice, the trimmed ends would eventually fail, and the wires would
have to be re-trimmed, creating an opportunity to slice off piece of a
finger. I have to confess that I’ve done the same thing more than once
in my adult life as well, when I’ve too impatient to fetch the proper
wire-stripping tool.</p>
<p>The problem with these kits – well, where do I start? Educationally
the main problem was that the thing you assembled bore no visual
relationship to the electronic circuit as it was drawn. If anybody had
drawn the circuit as it got constructed, it would have been
incomprehensible, like a diagram of a bird’s nest. Because the
relationship between function and structure was unclear, assembling the
circuit was an exercise in painstaking instruction-following – “connect
terminal 42 to terminal 6…” – rather than comprehension of the theory.
Troubleshooting was, as you might imagine, a nightmare.</p>
<p>Still, these Science Fair kits did allow for some interesting
constructions: AM radios, amplifiers, telegraphy devices,
light-sensitive alarms, and so on. As the only moving parts were the
wires, the kit would last forever, so long as you could trim new wires
when the old ones broke. The springs themselves did eventually get
sloppy, but you could generally find a place to put a wire that still
had a bit of tension.</p>
<p>To be fair to Radio Shack, their instructions were clear, written by
a native English speaker, and they explained the design principles in
detail. But, as you could assemble a circuit without understanding it –
in fact, the construction method more-or-less necessitated this approach
– the kit was only educational if you took the trouble to read all the
documentation. I did, as an aspiring geek, but I doubt I understood much
at ten years of age. The worst drawback, though, was that assembling
circuits with spring clips and flying wires was tedious and
error-prone.</p>
<p>So my mind was blown when I first came across a Gakken ‘denshi block’
kit, although I wasn’t to know that’s what it was for many years. A
sketchy-looking chap was selling these from a barrow in a village
market, squeezed between other disreputable fellows selling imitation
leather jackets and meat products that had started to smell. The kit
wasn’t expensive, even by pocket-money standards, although I can’t
remember how much I paid for it in 1976. £2, perhaps.</p>

</figure>
<p>I didn’t know at the time that the kit I had purchased was the
bottom-of-the-range model, nor that it was already discontinued by the
manufacturer – but subsequent events made that likely, as I’ll
explain.</p>
<p>The kit consisted of a plastic base-plate into which were cut slots
in a rectangular grid. Into this base you could slot the ‘denshi’ blocks
themselves. Each block was a clear plastic box about 1cm square and
about 2cm tall, containing a single component – transistor, resistor,
capacitor, etc. Later kits would have blocks containing only wires, but
mine had the wires as separate metal clips that plugged into the
base.</p>
<p>‘Denshi’ is a Japanese word that translates loosely as ‘electronic’.
I didn’t realize at the time that these kits were made in Japan,
although it was clear that the instructions hadn’t been written by
anybody who had English as a first language. I learned later that they
were produced by the Gakken company, and they were a genuine
innovation.</p>
<p>The denshi system radically reduced the tedium, and increased the
success rate, of assembling circuits. Not only was physical process of
assembly quicker and less error-prone, what you assembled actually
looked like the electronic circuit as conventionally diagrammed.</p>
<p>Although it isn’t clear in the photo, the electrical connections on
the denshi blocks emerge from the bottom of each block. Electrical
contact is made when two connectors are forced against one another in
the slot in the baseboard. It wasn’t a reliable means of connection over
the long term and, eventually, the contacts had to be bent slightly
outwards to restore connectivity. This clearly carried the risk of
snapping the contact off the block completely but, somehow, I managed to
avoid this.</p>
<p>Gakken’s later ‘EX’ range of kits used a different means of
connection, which can be seen in the photo below. For reasons I’ve never
understood, the new plastic was tinted, making the internal component
less visible. Perhaps the blocks were cheaper to manufacture in this
colour?</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The denshi blocks in the EX range had

</figure>
<p>These blocks were not held onto the baseboard by their contacts, as
had been the case in the SR kits. Instead they had corner cut-outs that
engaged with pegs, as can be seen in the photo below. The electrical
connectors were sprung, so the combination of the connectors and the
pegs made a solid assembly.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The EX-250 – an altogether more grown-up
implementation of the denshi block system</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another difference between the EX kits and the earlier SR series was
that the new kits had a kind of console that contained more
sophisticated (and not user-modifiable) components. In particular, the
tuned circuit for radio designs wasn’t a plug-in block in the EX kits,
but was built into the console, which also contained an amplifier and a
voltmeter, along with the battery. The SR kits had these either as
blocks, or just as external parts that had to be wired to the baseboard
using cables.</p>
<p>I had two favourite circuits for my SR-2A kit. The first was a simple
microphone amplifier. I could hide the loudspeaker in a sibling’s
bedroom, and project my voice into the room from a distance, causing
intense irritation.</p>
<p>My other favourite circuit was an FM transmitter – probably illegal.
It had enough range that I could over-ride BBC radio broadcasts in the
house, replacing them either with my own jabbering, or the output of a
my cassette player.</p>
<p>Eventually, while assembling one of the radio circuits, I connected
one of the transistor blocks the wrong way around, and burned it out. I
was upset about this but, when I returned to the market and found the
seller nowhere in evidence, I was distraught. My parents suggested I
write to the manufacturer, and see if they could supply a replacement.
It turned out that Gakken was based in Japan, but they had a UK
distributor. I can’t remember the name of this company, but they earned
my life-long affection. I was hoping at best to get a replacement
transistor but, in fact, within a week they sent me, free of charge, a
huge bag of denshi blocks and baseboards. With hindsight, I suspect it
was the rest of their UK stock – the SR range had already been
discontinued by this time.</p>
<p>With these extra parts, and the assistance of better-informed
relatives, I was able to construct things far beyond the original scope
of the kit, and elevate my ability to irritate my family to a whole new
level.</p>
<p>The Gakken kits eventually became more sophisticated, including logic
gates and, eventually, a microcontroller. I never had one of these kits,
though. Not only would it have been far beyond my purchasing power in
the 70s, by the time integrated circuits had become widely available I
had graduated to soldering circuits on strip-board. The first time I had
to solder up a 14-pin DIP IC, I cooked about a dozen of them before I
learned how to do it, or that there was such a thing as an IC socket.
Sadly, I’m even worse at this job fifty years later because, well,
because I’m fifty years older.</p>
<p>Denshi blocks, along with my youth and good eyesight, are a fading
memory. By about 1980, kids had found more interesting ways to spend
their time: home computers for the geeky ones, and video games for the
rest. When I was a teenager, I was interested in making electronic stuff
because, apart from it being an interesting pass-time, building it was
cheaper than buying it. I could make a perfectly serviceable stereo
amplifier for about a tenth the price of the slinky, brushed-aluminium
article in the hi-fi shop. Now, of course, that’s not true: improvements
in mass production have made it cheaper to buy finished goods than
components for anything that has a mass market. So it’s not just denshi
blocks that have faded away, but electronics kits of any kind.</p>
<p>The best we have these days are the dumbed-down, garish toy-like
products such as the “Snap Circuits” offering shown below. Superficially
these resemble denshi blocks, in that they have moveable components with
push-together contacts. Like the Science Fair and denshi kits they have
switches, motors, and batteries. What they don’t seem to have is any
connection to electronic theory – I’m sure they’re educational to some
extent, but I doubt you’d learn how a reflex radio circuit works.</p>

denshi system? Not really.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Geeky kids these days aren’t interested in transistors, and why
should they be, when you can pack a million of them into a
microcontroller chip? Contemporary geeks – and not just young ones – are
drawn to the Raspberry Pi, Arduino, or micro:bit ecosystems. Arguably,
learning about these things is more productive in the modern world than
understanding the behaviour of a tuned circuit; it’s also more likely to
broaden your employment opportunities.</p>
<p>The denshi block is a part of my childhood, as was the <a
href="chopper.html">Raleigh Chopper</a>. Both, I understand, had a brief
revival about twenty years ago; but the world moves on, and change isn’t
always for the worse. Geeks of all ages have plenty of other things to
amuse themselves with.</p>
