<h1>They don't make 'em like that any more: NVIDIA Shield K1 tablet</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/k1.png"

I savaged the NVidea Shield K1 in my
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/R3V7FLPJRZGWEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0171BS9CG#R3V7FLPJRZGWEE">2016 Amazon review</a>.
I compared it unfavourably to the Samsung Tab S8, which would have been
its main competitor at the time, even though the Tab S8 cost 
<i>twice</i> as much as the K1, despite its similar specification.
My S8 has long gone the way of eBay, but I use my K1 nearly every
day. In fact, as time has gone by, I've come to appreciate the
K1 more and more. 
</p>

<p>
The most notable thing about the K1, when it was released back in 2014, 
was the price.
The specification -- particularly of its video subsystem -- trounced 
everything at its price point, and sometimes beyond it.
For sure, you could get a cheaper tablet than the K1 -- if you didn't
mind waiting ten seconds between screen updates; but the K1 was
aggressively priced for a quality, high-spec tablet. These days you can
pick up a used one in good condition for about UK&pound;50, 
and it's certainly worth this
small investment, provided the battery hasn't been worked to exhaustion.
</p>
<p>
Although I haven't tried a side-by-side test, I suspect that the K1 would
out-perform any contemporary tablet that is priced comparably with the K1's 2014
price of about UK&pound;150, in spite of ten
years of technological development. Consider, for example, 
the Lenovo M8 tablet (current list price about
UK&pound;200), alongside the K1. 
Both units have  
~2GHz, four-core CPUs. Both have 32Gb of internal storage (although
the K1 was available in 64Gb). Both have an 8", IPS LCD screen. 
</p>
<p>
However, the K1 had a full-HD (1080p) screen, which is exactly the 
right resolution
for an 8" screen. The M8 has "only" an 800p screen, which 
would not have been class-leading even ten years ago, although it 
wouldn't have seemed as underspecified as it might today. The
K1 had an SD card slot for extra storage -- most modern tablets
do not (yes, I'm looking at <i>you</i>, Tab S6 Lite). 
</p>
<p>
In fact, when comparing the K1 to today's mid-priced tablets, 
it's almost as if the
last ten years didn't happen. Of course there are devices with
higher specifications -- much higher -- today, but the K1 out-guns 
today's similarly-priced offerings.
</p>
<p>
In my original review I complained that the K1 was large and heavy, but
it's lighter than my Samsung S5E. Of course, the S5E has a larger screen,
so it's entitled to weigh more; my point is that the K1 no longer 
seems particular heavy in the hand. I pointed out back in 2016 that the
K1 had rubberized hand grips and, although unconventional, this 
continues to be an
ergonomic benefit for me. It's easy to hand-hold the K1 without leaving
fingerprints on the screen, even one-handed if necessary (but not
for too long). 
</p>
<p>
Another point I noted, but did not dwell on, is that the K1 has a real
HDMI port. Not a silly USB C port that needs an adapter, but a real
HDMI port. You can connect the K1 to an external monitor and a power supply
at the same time. This is only possible on my Samsung tablet with a
docking station of some kind.
</p>
<p>
In 2016, I did not need to remark on the fact that the K1 has a proper,
3.5mm headphone jack -- everything did at that time. In a huge 
backward leap, other
manufacturers have abandoned this useful connection. So when I want to
listen to music or watch video with wired headphones, I reach for my K1, rather
than trying to work out where I put the stupid little USB headphone dongle
that I need for my Samsung.
<p>
Another pointless trend that Samsung adopted, but NVIDIA did not, was
the 4:3 screen layout. This was popularized by Apple in its iPad range,
but it never made any sense in devices that were mostly used for media
and games.
Samsung quietly reverted to the same 16:9 layout that everybody else
except Apple used, but a Tab S8 of the same vintage as the Shield K1
looks hopelessly dated now, just because its the screen shape -- 
as, frankly, a contemporary iPad does.
</p>
<p>
Coming from NVIDIA, it isn't surprising that the K1 was marketed
for gaming. It even had a plug-in game controller, although I never
used it, and I don't know how good it was. I guess this gaming heritage
is what made (and still makes) the K1 handle video so well. 
</p>
<p>
The K1 plays most full-HD video content smoothly, without any sign of
stuttering or audio lag. More significantly, perhaps, it scales lower-resolution
content to fit the Full-HD screen faultlessly. Even now, this can't always
be said for my Samsung tablet. Playing local videos using VLC is
a pleasure -- everything just works. Moreover -- again, unlike my
Samsung S5E -- I can stream full HD video on WiFi even if the access
point is at the other end of the house. All Samsung's tablets until
very recently struggled with WiFi reception.
</p>
<p>
Unlike modern tablets (and cellphones) it's relatively easy to
install custom ROMs on the K1. To be fair, it was easier on
most devices back in 2014 than it is now. Sadly, Lineage OS no longer
supports the K1, but version 15 variants for the K1 are still to
be found, which will provide Android 8, and an absence of Google
spyware, if that's a concern. It's comparatively easy to root a
K1, with or without installing a custom ROM. Doing any of these things
on a modern tablet is like sticking your face in a hornet's nest,
although it's probably fair to say that we didn't really understand
the security hazards of portable devices back in 2014. 
</p>
<p>
In summary, as the years have gone by, I've come to appreciate the
NVIDIA Shield tablet more and more. It's not perfect, but any
means -- it's still a coulomb-gobbler, rarely giving more than
three hours of screen-on time between charges. And the batteries
of early models have been known to explode, which adds a certain
something to watching a suspense movie.
</p>
<p>
An Android tablet, especially when rooted, is an amazingly powerful,
portable computing device. Rooting is necessary, sadly, as new
Android releases impose increasingly stringent internal security
constraints, making it more difficult to do productive work. 
The K1 was a powerful, low-cost tablet that was genuinely useful.
It's a shame that no manufacturer seems to be able to produce such
a thing today. Why don't modern tablets have expandable storage, 
HDMI ports, headphone jacks, and screens whose resolutions are
appropriate to their size? I really don't know.
