<h1 id="they-dont-make-them-like-that-any-more-the-raleigh-chopper">They
don’t make them like that any more: the Raleigh Chopper</h1>
<p><img src="img/chopper_logo.jpg" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>In this series of articles I usually write about icons of consumer
electronics, but I feel that a bicycle is sufficiently technological to
include. After all, the Raleigh Chopper – in the UK at least – was to
cycling what the Sony Walkman was to music. The Chopper was a radically
different kind of bike and it sold in crazy numbers, in the UK and
elsewhere. It’s difficult to believe now but, fifty years ago, all kids
and many adults got around by bicycle. Although everybody had a bike,
nobody liked bikes much. They were utilitarian, attracting no more
affection than your pencil case or your school uniform. The Walkman
changed the way we thought about portable audio devices, and the Chopper
changed the way we thought about cycling. For the first time, cycling
was cool. In fact, the Raleigh company might have gone bust, had it not
been for the extraordinary success of the Chopper.</p>
<p>When the Chopper was released in the late 60s, most bicycles either
had dropped or flat handlebars, as most still do. They certainly had two
wheels the same size. The Chopper was modeled on Harley-Davidson’s
motorcycle cruisers. The handlebars were enormous ‘ape-hangers’, the
seat was almost a couch and, oh boy, those wheels: a huge, fat one on
the back, and an absurdly skimpy one on the front. The chopper even had
suspension, and a centre console housing the gearshift lever – like
you’d find in a car.</p>
<p><img src="img/chopper.jpg" /></p>
<p>When I was twelve years old, I desperately wanted a Raleigh Chopper.
In particular, I wanted the model with derailleur gears. Why? Because
nobody else had one, I guess. And for good reason, it turns out. I had
to wait until these started to become available second-hand, because
nobody except the sons of company directors had new stuff. And it was
always <em>sons</em>: bicycles for girls had low crossbars, so girls
could mount them decorously whilst wearing skirts. The Chopper was
always a boys’ bike.</p>
<p>Eventually I got a Mark 2 Chopper – the only model to have the
derailleur gears – a few years old. It had, in fact, belonged to the son
of a company director. He had taken good care of it, or perhaps never
ridden it, but it showed signs of age. The Chopper was predominantly of
steel construction, and prone to rust. I spent many hours trying to
remove the rust spots from the chromed wheel rims and handlebars. I
never had much success with this nor, frankly, with actually riding the
Chopper.</p>
<p>The steel construction meant that a Chopper weighed about 20kg. At 12
years of age, that was <em>half my bodyweight</em>. It’s painful to
imagine pedaling a bike half my weight these days – not that such a
thing exists. In addition, all the weight was at the rear, which meant
that the front wheel lifted easily. That was fine for doing stunts, but
awful for cornering. I guess the Chopper was really intended for
teenagers to cruise around the neighbourhood attractions, not for actual
<em>transport</em>. I, on the other hand, had a four-mile ride to school
every day, uphill and into a stiff sea breeze. As you might imagine, my
infatuation with the Chopper did not last.</p>
<p>Although the Chopper was successful nationally, none of my friends or
schoolmates had one, and they weren’t impressed with mine. I guess they,
or their parents, realized how inappropriate such a bike was for daily
travel.</p>
<p>The sad reality is that the Chopper was a profoundly impractical
bicycle.</p>
<p>For example, the centre-console gearshift was hard to operate
accurately. That wasn’t such a problem for the three-speed models,
because there was so much space between the gear stops. For the
five-speed, however, it was hard to judge exactly where to put the lever
to get a particular gear. You couldn’t adjust the lever incrementally,
because it just didn’t provide enough sensitivity. The ape-hanger
handlebars didn’t allow for multiple hand positions, soon becoming
tiring on long rides. A couch-like seat might have been comfortable on a
Harley but, if you actually had to pedal, it chafed horribly. And that
seat never got any more comfortable with use.</p>
<p>Everything that made the Chopper look good to a teenaged boy in the
70s made it horrible to ride. I’m tempted to say that the Chopper was a
triumph of style over substance but, in fact, it was the substance – the
sheer amount of it – that was the main problem.</p>
<p>The Chopper, or bikes like it, are often shown in TV shows set in the
70s, for period authenticity. The Chopper shouts ‘70s’ like few other
artefacts. But, despite what I’ve often read, the bike ridden by Mike in
<em>Stranger Things</em> is not a Chopper: it was custom-made for the
show and, probably based on the Schwinn Sting-Ray (yes, it really does
have a hyphen in the name). The Sting-Ray (see photo below) has
distinctive, curved frame members, which set it apart from the Chopper.
And the wheels are the same size.</p>
<p><img src="img/stingray.jpg" /></p>
<p>Since the Sting-Ray was introduced in 1963, it’s plausible that it
was an inspiration for the Chopper, but the Chopper departs from
conventional bicycle aesthetics far more than the Sting-Ray does. I
imagine that the Sting-Ray was less of a pain to ride, as well.</p>
<p>For all its faults, I rode my Chopper for thousands of miles, every
mile of which was agony. I went on to cycle (sensible bikes) in races
and, even in my old age, I still cycle every day. After all, after
you’ve ridden a Chopper for a few years, every other bike feels like
it’s made of air. My current mount, a Genesis <em>Tour de Fer</em>, is
porky by modern standards, especially with its full set of luggage, but
it’s still a mere vapour compared to the Chopper. So perhaps I should
thank the old Chopper for preparing me well for a lifetime of
cycling.</p>
<p>The Chopper had a pretty good run for what was, essentially, a fad:
from 1969 until about 1983. At that time it was superseded by the next
teenage cycling fad: BMX. BMX bikes were mostly designed for stunts and
showing off just as the Chopper was, but you could at least use one to
get from A to B.</p>
<p>Such is the nostalgic appeal of the Chopper that Raleigh briefly
introduced a new model a few years ago. I understand that it sold well,
but Raleigh has so far not continued the production run. Understandable:
I can’t imaging that the Chopper would appeal much to kids today, even
those few who live in a place where it’s actually safe to cycle. And I
can’t imagine any father who had a Chopper in his youth would inflict
one on his kids.</p>
