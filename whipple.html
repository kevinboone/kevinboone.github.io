<h1>When science and engineering are in conflict: the weird Whipple truss bridge</h1>

<p>

  alt="close up of truss pin"/>
Since the 19th century We have come to understand structural 
engineering as a branch
of the physical sciences. Science and mathematics guide and inform all 
aspects of design, from skyscrapers to nanotechnology. 
</p>
<p>
This has been a staggeringly productive approach; so much so, that 
it's easy to lose sight of
the fact that we humans have been building magnificent, long-lasting 
structures for thousands of years <i>with no science whatsoever</i>. 
Our ancient Greek forebears built the Parthenon only a generation after
Pythagoras, and a century before Aristotle laid the foundations of
experimental science. Two thousand years later, this breathtaking 
building is largely still standing. So, of course, are the pyramids
of Giza and Stonehenge. 
</p>
<p>
How could the ancients do this? Leaving aside the popular 
theory that our ancestors 
had help from space aliens, the most plausible explanation is simply:
experience. Engineering in the pre-scientific world was entirely pragmatic.
Designers and architects did what had been found to work before, and 
expanded it incrementally, generation by generation. In this way we got from
mud huts to the great, soaring cathedrals of the middle ages, with no more
math than elementary trigonometry.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this process took a long, long timer: millennia, in fact. 
On the other hand, by treating
engineering as a science we got from Ulm Minster -- at ~160m the world's
tallest building at the end of the 19th century -- to the half-mile tall Burj
Khalifa in a mere hundred years.  
</p>
<p>
Science and engineering are now so closely bound together that it's almost
impossible to think of one without the other. And yet, science isn't
always a friend of engineering. Sometimes, science can lead us to design
strategies which, with hindsight, look completely barmy.
</p>
<p>
To support this odd, counter-intuitive claim, I would like to introduce the
<i>pin-joint truss bridge</i>. In the US, this design of bridge was known
for a long time as the 'Whipple truss', after Squire Whipple, who patented 
a design in the mid-19th century. Whipple's design was widely used by
a number of US railroad companies, and was almost ubiquitous in some
regions. 
</p>
<p>
If you've spent any time around heritage railways -- or, in some regions,
modern railways -- you'll have seen railway bridges of the Whipple
type (although I don't think that name was ever common in the UK).
These bridges have as their characteristic feature steel members
held together by giant pins, like this:
</p>

<p align="center">
<img width="650px" src="img/whipple.jpg" 
  alt="truss pin joint"/>
</p>

<p>
On the face of it, these pin joints amount to crazy engineering. Why?
Because they offer no redundancy. The entire load of the joined members
is carried by the pins, and they are loaded in shear. The shear strength
of a material is hard to assess, even in the lab, and much 
less in real-world conditions. 
</p>

<p>
To compound the problem, the part of the joint that is subject to the
heaviest sheer stresses is completely invisible. These days we have
ultrasonic imaging equipment that allows us to see into the joint and
check for cracking, but there was no such equipment in the 19th 
century. If a pin sheared, the entire bridge was at risk of collapse.
</p>

<p>
A more modern way to build a truss bridge is to make the joints using
<i>gusset plates</i>, like this:
</p>

<p align="center">
<img width="650px" src="img/whipple2.jpg" 
  alt="gusset plate joint"/>
</p>

<p>
Rather than a single pin, the load is shared across many smaller bolts
or rivets. This design not only offers improved redundancy, the joint
elements are reasonably easy to visualize, and individual elements can be
repaired or replaced without dismantling the bridge. 
</p>

<p>
People often wonder what purpose the pin joints serve. To be clear, they
<i>aren't</i> to allow movement in the structure. A truss bridge is
-- or should be -- completely rigid. To be fair, bridge designers do
sometimes use moveable pin joints to attach a bridge to its supporting
structure, to allow for some movement. But the characteristic feature
of the Whipple truss is that <i>all</i> joints are pin joints.
</p>

<p>
It's not as if 19th-century designers knew of no other way to join
bridge members. The world's earliest all-metal bridge -- the Coalbrookdale
Iron Bridge -- uses no pins. Pin joints seem to have been a feature of
truss bridges in particular. 
</p>

<p>
From the standpoint of engineering experience, or just common sense,
it seems that any bridge that could handle its load with pin joints could
also handle that load with rigid joints -- and more safely. So why the
fascination with pin joints?
</p>

<p>
This is example of science having an ambiguous relationship with 
engineering. From a 
purely scientific perspective, a pin-joint has a huge advantage
over any other kind of coupling. If construction members are pin-jointed,
they can <i>only transmit load in compression or tension</i>. In 
particular, no load on the bridge (other than the weight of the
construction members themselves) can <i>bend</i> the members.  
</p>

<p>
This means that it's easy to work out the stresses in each member of
the bridge -- and by 'easy' I mean that it requires no more than high-school 
trigonometry.
In fact, Squire Whipple didn't even use trigonometry: he worked out the
stresses using scale drawings of the size and directions of the loading 
forces.
</p>

<p>
This approach was called the 'method of joints'. To apply the method, we
start at some point on the bridge where all but two of the loading forces
are known -- probably at one end. Since we know that there can be no <i>net</i>
horizontal or vertical
force on the joint (else the bridge would be in motion) we can sum the
forces in each direction to get two equations for forces in balance. 
Solving these equations
gives us the two unknown forces. With these forces known, 
we can proceed to apply
the same process to the adjacent joints, one by one. Eventually, we can 
determine all
the stresses in all the members. From this we can choose materials and
sizes that will handle these stresses. It's important to understand that
there are no approximations here: the load-related forces can be 
determined <i>exactly</i> if we know the load the bridge has to carry.
And, of course, if the bridge can be constructed to match the mathematical
analysis we have used.
</p>

<p>
Whipple's method of joints only works if the members are joined by
perfect frictionless pins. Any other kind of joint can transmit
load in <i>bending</i>. Whipple did not have the math to work out the
stress in bridge members that are subject to bending forces. In fact, 
I'm not sure we do today, either -- in practice we would probably use a computer
to apply finite-element analysis to a problem of this kind.
</p>

<p>
When Squire Whipple was designing bridges in the mid 19th-century, 
the scientific approach to engineering was still somewhat in its infancy.
Whipple's method of joints allowed a precise calculation of the load-related
stresses, which in turn allowed for smaller, less expensive structural
members. Without this scientific approach, we would simply have had to 
use over-sized construction members -- the Forth Bridge is a good
example of this approach. 
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, applying the method of joints required engineers to 
construct bridges to
match their mathematical models, rather than the other way around. The math
only works for perfect frictionless pins, so they had to approximate 
perfect frictionless pins in their constructions, however unsafe that
was. The result was the rapid proliferation, all over the US and elsewhere,
of bridges with no redundancy in their construction. It's as if passenger
aircraft all had only a single engine, because we couldn't do the math
for a multi-engine design.
</p>

<p>
The method of joints is correctly considered a major landmark on the path
to scientific engineering. We've made many advances since Whipple's
day, and it's now almost inconceivable that we would undertake any 
major engineering project without a good understanding of the science.
</p>

<p>
And yet... Whipple's method could have been catastrophic. Despite their
19th-century popularity, nobody's building pin-joint truss bridges 
any more -- except garden railway modelling enthusiasts. 
</p>

<p>
If this situation makes you feel equivocal about the relationship between
science and engineering, it should. Of course science is the foundation
of modern engineering, but that's not a good reason to abandon common
sense and experience.
