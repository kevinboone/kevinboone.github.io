<h1>A skeptic's guide to headphones</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/headphones.jpg" 
  alt="headphones"/>
A bewildering array of headphones is now available, at prices
from a few pounds to sell-a-kidney. It's difficult to make an
informed buying choice, for two reasons.
</p>

<p>
First, the entire field is full of specialized jargon terms that
mean little to most people. The skeptic in me wonders whether
they mean anything to anybody. Second, whatever manufacturers 
say, there are no truly general-purpose headphones. 
No device will suit all
applications, so many people will own more than one, or 
make compromises.
</p>

<p>
In this article I'll describe the characteristics of the various
types of headphones that are currently available, without recourse
to vague, audiophile silliness. All the specific headphones I 
mention cost less than UK&pound;300 because, although I'm
fussy, I'm not stupid.
</p>

<h2>A note about cost/benefit considerations</h2>
<p>
Whatever anybody else tells you, relatively cheap headphones offer 
better value for money than expensive ones. Thousand-pound headphones
sound a lot better than ten-pound headphones, but they probably
don't sound a hundred times better. Of course, it's difficult to
assign a numerical value to how good something sounds, but common sense
would suggest that thousand-pound headphones would have to sound
staggeringly, bewilderingly good to justify the price.
The Sennheiser HD800S (current price about &pound;1300) sounds
pretty darned good, and no mistake. But the Sennheiser HD58X sounds
pretty good, too, and costs one eighth the price. If somebody left
me his HD800S in a will I'd accept gratefully, but I'm not about
to part with that amount of my hard-earned cash for such a 
marginal improvement in sound.
</p>
<p>
In fact, there are some great-sounding headphones in the &pound;100-200
range. And, unless you use headphones exclusively for listening to
music in a quiet room, the cheaper headphones are likely to be
much more versatile. That's because the really expensive headphones
are catering for the "audiophile" market, where extortionate 
pricing and single-minded
lack of versatility are actually selling points.
</p>
<p>
I'm not saying that expensive equipment is bad -- only that, with the
levels of technology and mass-production we have today, inexpensive
equipment can be quite good. It's true that, in general, you
get what you pay for; but with headphones over about &pound;200
you'll pay an increasing amount for a diminishing improvement.
</p>

<h2>Headphones and headsets -- a digression</h2>
<p>
There was at one time a distinction between a "headset" and
"headphones".
A headset was
a communications device -- a headphone with a built-in microphone.
These days, almost all headphones have a microphone, because manufacturers
know that most people will use them with a cellphone.
So most modern headphones qualify as "headsets" in the original
sense. Consequently, the word "headset" is
now used to describe something boringly functional, 
probably designed for office use. 
</p>
<p>
In fact, modern "headsets" are essentially light-weight headphones 
(with microphone),
designed for all-day use. You shouldn't turn up your nose at the sound
quality of some of these devices, particularly if all-day wear is
important. The Sennheiser SC75 weighs almost nothing, has both
jack and USB connections, and actually sounds pretty good for
its current price of about &pound;50. It's the headphone/set I use
most often for music during the working day, simply because it's to 
hand all the time and I use it for business calls. To be
sure, it won't win any hi-fi awards, but the sound is quite acceptable
for anything other than the most critical listening.
</p>
<p>
There are also gaming headsets that offer excellent sound quality.
These are usually more expensive than office headsets, but 
less expensive than branded "hi-fi" headphones.
</p>

<h2>In-ear, on-ear, around ear, bone conduction</h2>
<p>
"In-ear headphones" is the new, rather precious term for what we used
to call "earphones". These push into the ear canal, usually
providing good sound isolation and (necessarily) light weight. There are
a few almost-in-ear phones, like most of the Bose in-ear range, that don't
completely seal in the ear canal, but are held in place above it using
soft flanges. The lack of sound isolation created by this arrangement
is good for safety (you can hear traffic), and has a musical delivery 
that suits some people.
</p>
<p>
On-ear headphones clamp onto the pinna of the ear, so are usually
smaller and lighter than full-sized, around-ear designs. However, 
the fit leads to an awkward compromise -- if the clamping force
is too tight, the fit will generally
be uncomfortable on the ears, and tend to cause overheating. But if
it's too loose, the whole weight is carried by the headband. 
These headphones need a well-padded headband for long-term comfort,
but often don't have one. The hugely popular Sennheiser HD25 range
has a split headband, which can be adjusted to spread the weight
in a satisfactory way. Still, the awkward weight distribution does
reduce somewhat the benefit of light weight that on-ear headphones
ought to offer.
</p>
<p>
Around-ear headphones completely surround the pinna of the ear and,
as a result, clamp against the skull, not the ear. Most headphones
that aim for optimum sound quality are of this construction. They're
usually heavy, particularly if wireless, and restrict head movement.
It's also been argued -- not entirely convincingly --
that some component of audio sensation is actually in the pinna, not
the auditory apparatus of the ear. Around-ear headphones do
not completely prevent the pinna responding to sound, and this is potentially
an argument in their
favour. Still, if you're looking
for top-end sound quality, you're probably going to favour
around-ear designs anyway, because that's what's available.
</p>
<p>
Both on-ear and around-ear headphones <i>usually</i> offer better
sound quality than in-ear devices, in the same price bracket. Moreover, the
larger designs aren't as dependent on fit to get decent sound. This is
why reviews of in-ear phones vary so wildly, I think -- some people are
lucky, and get a good fit; others less so. Bass performance is exquisitely
sensitive to fit, and it's worth experimenting with whatever is provided
to adjust the ear fit. Some people buy aftermarket foam sleeves and
what-nots for their in-ear phones and, in fact, these aren't entirely
snake oil -- changing the fit even slightly can hugely affect the sound.
Whether it affects it for better or worse is, like everything in this
field, a matter of personal preference.
</p>
<p>
It's now quite difficult to get on-ear, wired phones that offer really
good sound quality, simply because it's difficult to get on-ear, wired
phones
at all. They have limited application, and few manufacturers still
make them. The Audio Technica ATH-m60x is a notable exception, and
not too expensive.
</p>
<p>
Bone conduction is a relatively new technology, which uses the direct
mechanical conduction of sound from a transducer to the skull around
the ear canal. It's taken a long time to design bone conduction phones
that sound decent, but such designs are now available. The sound quality
doesn't rival any of the more traditional designs, but it's still 
acceptable. Bone conduction designs don't isolate external sound
at all, which is good if you want to be able to hear people or
traffic around
you. And, because they don't work on the ear canal at all, you can
block <i>all</i> external sound using well-fitted ear plugs. In
principle this makes bone conduction phones very versatile. 
These devices are invariably wireless, and usually light-weight and
unobtrusive. I use Aeropex <i>Aftershokz</i> headphones in the gym
with ear plugs, and often at home without. They are
by no means my first choice for sound quality, but they are
convenient and unobtrusive.
</p>
<p>
Another advantage of bone-conduction phones is that they can be
made completely sealed and waterproof.
</p>
<p>
I find that bone conduction phones vibrate uncomfortably at high
volumes -- it feels like I have a bug in my ear. However, reports that
they can shake the fillings out of your teeth are probably exaggerated.
</p>


<h2>Wired or wireless</h2>
<p>
The convenience of wireless -- usually Bluetooth -- headphones can't
be denied. However, the sound quality of wireless headphones only 
approaches that of wired headphones at the top end of the market.
There has, until recently, been little motivation for 
manufacturers to emphasise sound
quality in their wireless models, because the main limitation in 
quality was the Bluetooth interface itself. 
</p>

<p>
Recently, however, Bluetooth audio coding methods like LDAC and
AptX have, in principle, opened the way to the development of 
wireless headphones with plausible hi-fi credentials. The introduction
of AptX HD has gone even further in this direction. 
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, all these coding methods are proprietary, and are not
available in all headphones, or in all playback devices. A few cellphones
support AptX HD, as do a few top-end portable music players. Some devices
support both AptX and LDAC but, in practice, it's usually one or the other,
because of licensing costs.
</p>

<p>
If your playback device is primarily a cellphone, you might find that
the decreasing lack of support for wired headphones pushes you 
towards wireless. It's usually possible to connect wired headphones
to a cellphone's USB socket, but results are variable, and
somewhat unpredictable.
</p>

<p>
I think it's fair to say that, among wireless technologies,
only AptX HD really comes close to the sound quality that can be
achieved with wired headphones. But, frankly, LDAC and AptX are 
good enough for most people in most situations. However, the
presence of these technologies in headphones is no guarantee that the
rest of the device is up to the same standard -- the rest of the
device has to be constructed accordingly.
</p>

<p>
In short, if you want decent sound quality from wireless headphones,
you need to be willing to spend a bit of money, and look for support
for at least AptX or LDAC. And, of course, you'll need a player
(or cellphone, or whatever) that supports these standards.
</p>

<p>
Leaving aside sound quality, it's important to remember that 
wireless headphones (including in-ear) 
will be heavier than wired and, of course, will
have a battery that needs to be charged. Wireless headphones are usually
designed for use with cellphones, and have call controls and 
microphones built in; wired
devices usually don't have these features. Top-end wireless headphones
usually have active noise cancelling but, again, this adds weight
to the device.
</p>
<p>
Wireless in-ear phones come in many different formats. Typically 
both ear units are connected to a common electronic module, either
in a neck-band or slung between the ears. Neck-band designs usually
offer the best battery life and Bluetooth range, and least weight
in the ears, but the format does not suit everybody. These units have
become very popular for sports and fitness activities, because they 
don't place a lot of weight on the head, and don't restrict motion much.
Sports units are typically water-resistant, and have locking flanges
to keep them in place during activity.
</p>
<p>
So-called "true wireless" or "free wireless" designs have independent
electronic units for each ear. 
Designing these tiny devices has been a magnificent
engineering effort, and they have become very popular, despite
their profound disadvantages. The most obvious of these is that it's
difficult to achieve both low weight and long battery life. Despite 
manufacturers' optimistic claims, 1-2 hours continuous use is 
common. Proprietary charging cases take away some of the sting, but you 
can't use the phones at the same time as charging them. Having said
that, I should point out that the Samsung true wireless buds can
be used singly, leaving the other free for charging. I'm 
not sure whether that's true of other models.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I do not much care for true wireless earbuds for anything
other than listening to audiobooks. I have yet to find any 
that I would feel happy using to listen to music. I can only guess that
the success of these devices has come about because their owners haven't
heard anything better. It isn't even as if they're particular convenient,
except perhaps for sports; and, even then, you'd probably need an
(expensive) noise cancelling model if you don't want to blow your
eardrums out.
</p>
<p>
Although it's not relevant to music, the issue of <i>latency</i> arises
when using wireless headphones to watch video. There's often a small
delay between the picture and the sound, caused by the time taken to
encode, transmit, decode, and process the digital audio signal.
In my experience, few modern wireless headphones are badly affected
by latency, but I appreciate that some people may be more fussy
in this area that I am.
</p>


<h2>Noise cancellation and isolation</h2>
<p>
In most circumstances, we want headphones to block external sounds,
at least to some extent. It's not really safe to crank up the volume
to drown out the environment although, like most people, I find myself
doing this from time to time. We can block external sound in simple,
mechanical ways, like providing a good seal around the ears, or in
fancy electronic ways. The Sennheiser HD25 is a master of "passive"
(mechanical) sound isolation, but this effectiveness comes at the expense
of tight clamping around the ears. Many in-ear phones are naturally
isolating, because they block the ear canal. 
</p>
<p>
For many years, Bose was the king of active (electronic) noise cancellation.
The first time I switched on the Bose QC20i, in a noisy airport 
departure lounge, I felt that I had suddenly gone deaf. To be fair,
this in-ear headphone wouldn't be my first choice for listening
to music -- it's sound delivery isn't really to my taste -- but
oh, my, the noise cancellation was awesome.
</p>
<p>
Since then, other manufacturers have caught up, and decent active 
noise cancellation
is no longer limited to Bose. In full-sized headphones, the 
Sony WF-1000XM3 and Sennheiser 
<i>Momentum 3</i> are viable challengers to the hugely-popular Bose
QC35 in the noise cancellation contest. All three of these devices
are wireless, heavy, and right at the top of my price range. 
As yet, I have not found an
<i>in-ear</i> phone, at any price, that has active noise cancellation
as good as the old QC20i. 
</p>

<h2>Open back, closed back</h2>
<p>
Most headphones that aim for top sound quality are of an open-back
design. A fully open back allows the loudspeaker diaphragm to 
vibrate freely in uncompressed air, which reduces many problems with
unwanted resonance. However, as much noise leaves the back of the headphone as enters your ears, which makes them unsuitable for use at high volume
around other people. Moreover, the open design does not block much,
if any, external sound. 
</p>
<p>
It is often claimed that the open design leads to an improved
<i>sound stage</i>, that is, an increased feeling of openness and
three-dimensionality. To get this benefit, you'll probably also
have to go for an around-ear, rather than on-ear design.
</p>
<p>
My experience is that there is some truth in these claims.
I've found that the AKG K702 (around-ear, open-back) is particularly
good in this area (although not in all areas; such is the nature
of headphones). Closed-back headphones, at any price, don't seem
to offer any sensation of sound stage at all; the same is true for
in-ear phones. At their best, closed-back designs will create a 
stereo image just outside your head. At worst, the stereo image will
be a meaningless jumble.
</p>
<p>
Still, I've not found any headphones, at any price, that offer a
sound stage that matches that of even modestly-priced loudspeakers. 
Since many open-back designs direct almost as much sound into the
environment as loudspeakers would, their application is limited.
</p>
<p>
I use open-back headphones for listening in a quiet environment at home,
when there are other people around, but not in the same room. For all
other applications I use closed-back headphones. It goes without saying
that open-back headphones are no use for travel, or in the gymnasium.
</p>
<p>
My favourite open-back headphones (in my price range) are the
Sennheiser HD58x. They have a neutral sound delivery even at 
high volume, with no obvious unexpected resonances or distortion.
However, they are big and heavy, even for a wired design. If there
is a <i>wireless</i> open-back headphone design that sounds any good,
I haven't heard it. All the decent wireless headphones have
closed backs. 
</p>


<h2>High impedance, low impedance</h2>
<p>
<i>Impedance</i>, measured in <i>ohms</i>,
controls the amount of current that flows
in an electrical device when a certain alternating voltage is
applied to it. Impedance depends on frequency, so values quoted by
manufacturers are only nominal. In the headphone context, a
"low" impedance is in the range of 30 ohms, and a "high" impedance
over 300 ohms.
</p>
<p>
Traditionally, the impedance of a
headphone was determined mostly by the amount of wire in its
speaker coils -- more wire, greater impedance. Lower 
impedance has (or rather had) the advantage that we can get
more current in the speaker coil -- hence more volume -- for
a particular voltage. This is a big deal when using portable
music players and cellphones, because they are battery-powered.
With mains-powered equipment, impedance could be higher, if there
was any advantage to making it so.
</p>
<p>
And was there an advantage? Perhaps. If the headphone offers a
high impedance, its response to an electrical signal will be
less affected by the characteristics of the amplifier and the
cable. The high impedance leads, in principle, to a more
predictable electro-mechanical behaviour.
</p>
<p>
Whatever the notional advantages, using high-impedance headphones
can be a nuisance with portable devices. You'll often see these
headphones described as "hard to drive" or just "fussy". Most
decent-quality portable music players will drive high-impedance 
headphones reasonably well, but most (all?) cellphones won't.
</p>
<p>
Most headphones currently on the market have nominal impedances
less than about 70 ohms, simply because portable players are
so popular. Even more traditional "hi-fi" vendors are now moving
to low-impedance designs. If sound quality is a primary concern,
then you should use low-impedance headphones with low-impedance
cabling and connectors. The main symptom of poor-quality cabling
is a lack of stereo channel separation but, frankly, the effect
is not usually prominent. Cable upgrades are available for many
popular headphones, but make sure you buy from a seller with a good
refund policy, as you're unlikely to notice much difference.
</p>
<p>
It goes without saying that issues of impedance are irrelevant in
wireless headphones, or in any headphone that has built-in electrical
amplification.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
There was a time -- not so very long ago -- when you had to spend a lot
of money to get reasonable sound quality from headphones. It wasn't
all that long ago that wireless headphones sounded awful, and were
unreliable, at any price. 
</p>
<p>
Things have changed. While there will always be people willing to
spend a fortune chasing the tiniest improvement in sound quality,
for most purposes it isn't really necessary. 
</p>
<p>
What is, necessary, perhaps is to know how you intend to use your
headphones, and choose a design that is suitable for that application.
Headphone manufacturers present us with a lot of glossy silliness but, in
the end, the principles are not that complicated.
