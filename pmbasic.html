<h1>Back to BASICs with a Pro Micro microcontroller</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/pro-micro.jpg" 
  alt="Pro Micro"/>
Back in the day -- and the "day" I'm thinking of was sometime in the mid-1970s
-- desktop computers had 8-bit CPUs, and booted to a BASIC programming
environment. There's little place for an 8-bit CPU in a modern computer --
even my watch has more computing power than this. However, 8-bit CPUs are still
pretty common in the form of microcontroller units (MCUs). These are the
small devices that operate electronic equipment, from refrigerators to TV remote
controls.
</p>
<p>
The Arduino range of products aimed to bring microcontrollers to the masses
(well, kind of), by providing ready-assembled boards with intuitive development
tools and a useful library of software components. Most of the Arduino range is
based on Atmel AVR microcontrollers which appear, on the face of it, to be
similar to the Z80 and 8080 CPUs of yesteryear. They have an 8-bit data bus,
and a 16-bit address space (meaning that they can directly handle 64 kB of
memory of all forms). They have a CPU-like instruction set, with registers and
accumulators, a stack pointer and program counter -- all the stuff you'd find
in a CPU of the 70s and 80s.  In some ways, though, 
an AVR MCU is strikingly, and
inconveniently, different to an old-school CPU, as I'll explain later. 
</p>
<p>
Still, if you want to re-live the 1970s programming experience (and
who wouldn't?) running BASIC on an Arduino-like device seems like
a reasonable way to do it. It would be possible to build a "real" BASIC
machine by fitting an Arduino with a keyboard and some sort of display
-- an LCD character matrix, for example. However, for proof-of-concept
purposes I'm happy to connect my Arduino to a terminal emulator, and
just pretend. The SparkFun Pro Micro is a reasonable choice for this
project, because it has built-in USB, which can be used for
communications, and only costs a few pounds. 
Having only 32kB of flash ROM and 2kB of RAM means it has capabilities
very similar to mid-70s desktop computers. Even by 1981, the idea
of 1-2 kB of RAM was starting to look dated. 
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>Fun fact</b>: the Sinclair ZX81 had 1k of RAM built in. You could obtain an
extra 16k the form of a plug-in "RAM Pack". This fitted so poorly that the
ZX81 would crash if you even looked at it in a funny way. Eventually,
enterprising vendors started producing "anti-crash devices". These were,
essentially, wedges to put under the ZX81, which caused the RAM Pack to lean
more heavily on its contacts. Ah, those were the days... 
</blockquote>

<p>
This article is about the implementation of "PMBASIC", a proof-of-concept,
minimally-interactive BASIC coding environment for
the Pro Micro. It will probably work on the Arduino Leonardo and, with
some modifications, on other Arduino boards.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>
Like many computing professionals who are past the first flush of youth,
I have <a href="retrocomputing.html">an interest in early home computers</a>.
However there is, potentially, a less sordid aspect to this exercise.
Devices like the Raspberry Pi and Arduino are being promoted as educational
tools in the area of "physical computing" -- that's making motors turn
and lights flash, basically. But a Raspberry Pi is not a cheap piece
of equipment (in classroom terms), and it's still really a desktop computer
with a few I/O pins. The Arduinos need a considerable learning investment
just to get an LED to flash, because you've got to master the proprietary
IDE and toolchain, which also means installing a couple hundred megabytes of
software on a workstation. You can do this is a classroom setting, but 
not in five minutes.
</p>
<p>
Although I have no direct experience of school-level teaching, it
seems plausible to me that kids will take more of an interest
in programming, if they can see real-world things happening. Telling your
computer to print "Hello, World" doesn't offer much satisfaction, especially
when you had to type "Hello, World" in the first place. But moving
a robot arm around on a desktop has a more visceral appeal. 
</p>
<p>
A BASIC environment for a cheap Arduino-like device like the Pro Micro
provides a way to experiment with physical computing that has almost 
no start-up cost. There's no need to spend more than, say, ten pounds on
hardware per desk, and there's no software to install on your workstation apart
from a terminal emulator. 
Just flash the ROM on the Arduino and you're good to go. And if you
blow it up in the classroom, just throw it away and plug in a new one.
</p>
<p>
So, from the start, I wanted a version of BASIC that would offer
specific Arduino capabilities -- particularly, the ability to read
and write I/O pins, and do reasonably precise timing. Here's what
"blink" looks like in PMBASIC, with an LED on pin 17 (which is the
"receive" LED on a Pro Micro, so you don't even have to connect
any additional hardware).
</p>
<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#993399">10</font> pin <font color="#990000">=</font> <font color="#993399">17</font>
<font color="#993399">20</font> pinmode pin<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#993399">1</font>
<font color="#993399">30</font> digitalwrite pin<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#993399">1</font>
<font color="#993399">40</font> delay <font color="#993399">1000</font>
<font color="#993399">50</font> digitalwrite pin<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#993399">0</font>
<font color="#993399">60</font> delay <font color="#993399">1000</font>
<font color="#993399">70</font> goto <font color="#993399">10</font>
</pre>

<p>
If you want to get nearer to the bone, and work directly with the 
Arduino's memory-mapped I/O model, you can do the same thing like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#993399">10</font> poke #<font color="#993399">24</font><font color="#990000">,</font><font color="#993399">1</font>
<font color="#993399">20</font> poke #<font color="#993399">25</font><font color="#990000">,</font><font color="#993399">1</font>
<font color="#993399">30</font> delay <font color="#993399">1000</font>
<font color="#993399">40</font> poke #<font color="#993399">25</font><font color="#990000">,</font><font color="#993399">0</font>
<font color="#993399">50</font> delay <font color="#993399">1000</font>
<font color="#993399">60</font> goto <font color="#993399">10</font>
</pre>

<p>
This method, of course, requires a bit more understanding of how
the hardware works -- potentially not a bad thing.
</p>
<p>
Using an interactive (even minimally-interactive) command-based interface
to the Arduino provides an immediacy that is lacking if you have to
compile code and burn it to flash to do simple tests.
If I want to test whether a particular analog sensor (for example) is
setting a particular pin to the right voltage, I just need to enter
at the PMBASIC prompt:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
> analogread 10, a
> a
442
</pre>


<h2>How?</h2>
<p>
There are plenty of minimal BASIC interpreters written in C. Some have
even been ported to run on Arduino, with varying degrees of success. 
I wanted a complete (if simplistic) editing environment, and I did
try to graft one onto an existing interpreter. However, I never 
ended up with anything that both (a) worked and (b) would fit into
a Pro Micro. 
</p>
<h3>BASIC interpreter</h3>
<p>
The nearest I could find to a simple BASIC interpreter that would 
fit the bill was 
<a href="https://github.com/adamdunkels/ubasic" target="_blank">uBasic</a>, 
by Adam Dunkels, from around 2014. In end, I could not use this code in
its existing form, for a number of reasons, but I found its general
approach useful.
</p>
<p>
The approach to parsing BASIC taken by uBASIC, and now by PMBASIC, is a
mixture of formal syntax tree descent, and ad-hoc pattern recognition,
done on a line-by-line level.
For example, consider a BASIC statement like this:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#993399">10</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">PRINT</font></b> <font color="#FF0000">"t="</font><font color="#990000">,</font> t<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#FF0000">" msec"</font> 
</pre>
<p>
We <i>could</i> build this statement into a formal syntax tree, with all
the various arguments in place, and then process it in that form. However,
we know that <code>PRINT</code> processes all its arguments sequentially,
with no regard for more detailed structure. The statement ends at the
end of the text line, whatever happens to be on the next line.
So, rather than building a 
syntax tree, we just need to loop over the arguments and process each one.
</p>
<p>
But consider this statement:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#993399">10</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">PRINT</font></b> <font color="#FF0000">"t="</font><font color="#990000">,</font> q <font color="#990000">+</font> <font color="#990000">(</font>t <font color="#990000">-</font> r<font color="#990000">)</font> <font color="#990000">/</font> <font color="#993399">1000</font><font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#FF0000">" msec"</font> 
</pre>

<p>
We can't just parse the arithmetic expression 
<code>q + (t - r) / 1000</code> as a sequence of tokens, strictly 
left-to-right. We need to evaluate the bracketed expression
<code>(t - r)</code> first, then divide by 1000, then add <code>q</code>.
At this point, we really do have to parse against a proper syntax tree, so
that the expression elements are evaluated in the right order. PMBASIC
uses the familiar recursive-descent method for this task, which does
absorb a certain amount of stack. However, as we're printing the results
as we go, there's no need to build an abstract syntax tree or anything
of that complexity.
</p>
<p>
A similar approach can be used with more complex constructs, like this:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#993399">10</font> FOR i <font color="#990000">=</font> <font color="#993399">1</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">to</font></b> p 
<font color="#993399">20</font>   <b><font color="#0000FF">PRINT</font></b> i
<font color="#993399">30</font> NEXT
</pre>

<p>
This FOR...NEXT construct does span multiple lines, but all we need to
control its execution is in line 10. So what we need to do is to store
the line number "10" and the loop counter in a stack, then 
execute the following statements
until NEXT. At that point, we check what is the top of the FOR stack, 
and make the appropriate tests. Then we can either jump
back to line 10, or pop the FOR information off the stack and continue.
In practice, we won't store the line number in the stack, but the offset
of that line in the program text, which is a bit faster.
</p>
<p>
This semi-formal approach to parsing works well with a language that is
essentially line-by-line, like BASIC, and it uses minimal resources. 
A more flexible language (I considered Lua, for example) requires a
more formal approach to parsing, with a lot more parsing logic, requiring
a lot more memory. There is actually an "eLua" specifically for embedded
systems, but I couldn't get it even close to fitting into the flash of
a Pro Micro.
</p>
<p>
The problem with PMBASIC's approach to parsing is that it's horribly
inflexible. Any trivial addition of features requires changing the 
parser, which means another round of testing. Also, tokenization,
parsing, and execution are hopelessly entangled, which makes things 
like error recovery really awkward. 
</p>
<p>
The problem with error recovery is that you can't just <code>exit(0)</code>
your program on error in a microcontroller, even if that would be
an acceptable way of dealing with errors in a desktop application.
An error has to deliver the
user neatly back to the editor, so changes can be made. This means inserting
fairly extensive error checks into all parts of the parser and tokenizer.
This error handling contributes perhaps 30% of the total size
of PMBASIC. 
</p>

<h3>Editor</h3>

<p>
PMBASIC has only the most rudimentary editing facilities. There are a 
couple of reasons for that. First, handling editing keys other than
"backspace" requires a knowledge of the terminal's control
sequences. Various terminals,
and terminal emulators, exist and I don't want to have to provide
PMBASIC with a terminal capability database. Frankly, it's difficult 
enough even to be sure which control code corresponds to the 
backspace key. Parsing ANSI-style keyboard escape codes is 
a programming task of about the same level of complexity
as parsing BASIC.
</p>
<p>
Second, and probably more important -- if you're operating 
PMBASIC from a desktop computer with a terminal editor, you can just
cut-and-paste code from the desktop into the terminal. 
</p>
<p>
Consequently, PMBASIC has an early-70s approach to editing BASIC:
if you type a line that starts with a number, it's assumed  to be 
part of the program. If you type something that doesn't start with 
a number, it's either a BASIC statement to be executed immediately,
or it's a command. Commands are non-program verbs like LIST, LOAD,
SAVE, and NEW. To change a line in the program, just type a new one
with the same line number. To add a line between two existing lines, 
just enter it with a line number between the existing numbers. 
To delete a line, just enter the line 
number with no text. You probably wouldn't want to enter more than
a dozen or so lines of code this way but, in a pinch, it does work.
</p>
<p>
LOAD and SAVE are implemented to store and retrieve program code
from the Arduino EEPROM. The Pro Micro has 1kB of EEPROM, which is
roughly the same amount of RAM available to store a program, so that's
a happy coincidence. In the days when line-based BASIC editors were
the latest thing, we stored programs on cassette tape; I've no wish
to relive <i>that</i> experience.
</p>

<h2>The result</h2>

<p>
Here's a screenshot of a PMBASIC session, seen in the Minicom terminal
emulator on a Linux system.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/pmbasic_screenshot.png" width="650px"/>
</p>

<p>
Because parsing and program execution are so closely interconnected,
PMBASIC is not going to be fast. Here is a timing test session:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#993399">5</font> l <font color="#990000">=</font> <font color="#993399">100</font>
<font color="#993399">10</font> millis a
<font color="#993399">20</font> for i <font color="#990000">=</font> <font color="#993399">1</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">to</font></b> l
<font color="#993399">30</font>   for j <font color="#990000">=</font> <font color="#993399">1</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">to</font></b> l
<font color="#993399">40</font>     rem
<font color="#993399">50</font>   next
<font color="#993399">60</font> next
<font color="#993399">70</font> millis b
<font color="#993399">80</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">print</font></b> l <font color="#990000">*</font> l <font color="#FF0000">" loops in "</font> b <font color="#990000">-</font> a <font color="#FF0000">" msec"</font>
<font color="#990000">&gt;</font> run
<font color="#993399">10000</font> loops in <font color="#993399">17618</font> msec
</pre>

<p>
That's about 500 do-nothing loops per second. It's nowhere near as fast
as a similar piece of C code, which might achieve 50,000 loops per second.
Still, it's fast enough for experimental purposes. It's fast enough, for
example, to scan a keyboard matrix -- provided you don't want to do a
whole lot when a key is pressed.
</p>
<p>
PMBASIC has many, many limitations. Most obviously, it has no support
for floating-point math. It wouldn't be hard to add that support, and
there's plenty of room left in the flash ROM, but speed would suffer,
as the Pro Micro has no hardware floating-point processor. 
There's no way to define functions, or to pass data between subroutines
except in variables. And so the list goes on. Can these limitations
be overcome? Certainly. Is it worth the effort? Well...
</p>

<h2>Problems...</h2>
<p>
The limitations of working with an 8-bit microcontroller with 2k RAM
shouldn't need much explaining. In fact, though, implementing a BASIC
interpreter (or any interpreter) in an Arduino is even more difficult
than it first appears. It's more difficult that it is on "real"
8-bit CPUs like the 8080 and Z80.
</p>
<p>
Most real CPUs are based on some form of Von Neumann design. The VN
architecture is so widespread that we hardly even think about it. In
a VN system, program and data memory are freely mixed -- the RAM
of my desktop PC will contain, at any given time, a mixture of data
and program code. 
</p>
<p>
AVR devices, including Arduinos, implement a "Harvard" architecture, in
which program and data memory are <i>completely separate</i>. Program
code cannot, for the most part, read data stored in the flash ROM; nor
can executable code be placed into RAM. What this means is that, although
the static and textual data that accompanies the program is burned into flash 
when the program is uploaded, the first thing that the program has
to do is copy all that data into RAM. This must happen
<i>even for data that will never change</i>. If you're using 
regular development
tools this is taken care of automatically -- as a developer you don't
have to control the process. But if you <i>don't</i> control it,
it's very easy to fill up the RAM with read-only data.
</p>
<p>
A parser, for any language, will store and process a lot of text. Most
obviously there will be tables of keywords and symbols, error messages,
prompts, and instructional messages. We simply can't copy all this stuff into
RAM, and still have any space left to store a program in.
</p>
<p>
It's possible to subvert the compiler's usual behaviour,
and leave all the static data in flash. But then you have to
take care of copying it into RAM when you need it, because it
can't be read directly from flash at runtime. You'll either need
to allocate RAM for it dynamically, or rely on fixed buffers in
certain areas of RAM. In either case, the process of copying the
data from flash to RAM is comparatively slow.
</p>
<p>
Managing data this way is not too difficult for relatively large
blocks of data, that are used infrequently, like error messages. For
symbol tables and other parser structures, which are potentially going
to be used hundreds of times per second, it's both awkward and slow.
Worse, it leads to a program structure where components have complex
and unmanageable dependencies on one another. Although it's written in
C, PMBASIC is structured rather like an assembler program, with all
the problems that entails.
</p>
<p>
The only real solution to this problem is to use a microcontroller
with a completely different architecture -- perhaps one based on 
ARM cores. As I write this, the Raspberry Pi Pico has just been announced, 
and it appears to have a radically improved specification from a Pro
Micro, for about the same price. The Pico appears to be capable of
running Python, but whether it can do it in an interactive session,
I'm not sure. I'm not even sure whether the USB port on the Pico
can be used for terminal communication like the one 
on the Pro Micro can. I shall
try to find out, when they become available.
</p>

<h2>Further work</h2>
<p>
At present, PMBASIC lacks support for many features that are needed to
implement more than toy programs. It would not be all that hard to add
</p>
<ul>
<li>floating-point numbers,<p>
</p></li>
<li><p>
string manipulation,
</p></li>
<li><p>
arrays,
</p></li>
<li><p>
function calls with parameters,
</p></li>
<li><p>
etc.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
What would radically improve the usefulness of PMBASIC would be external
storage, so the RAM could be used just for variables and stacks. Doing
this would require adding at least a minimum of file management. It
isn't hard to add SD card support to an Arduino, but we're in the realm
of specialist components. Doing this will bring the total cost much
closer to Raspberry Pi territory.
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
The full source code for PMBASIC is available
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/PMBASIC">in my GitHub repository</a>.
It clearly is possible to run an interactive BASIC environment
-- albeit a rudimentary one -- on a SparkFun Pro Micro attached to
a terminal. Because of the limitations of the AVR architecture, it's
difficult to do it efficiently without some really fiddling coding
techniques, and I'm unsure whether it's worth developing the project
further. Newer, more highly specified devices like the Pico might
change the picture completely -- that remains to be seen.
