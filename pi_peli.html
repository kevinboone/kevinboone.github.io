<h1>Peli "Protector" case as a rugged enclosure for a Raspberry Pi-based field terminal</h1>

<p>

I'd been thinking for a while that a Peli "Protector" case would make a
good enclosure for a field terminal based on a Raspberry Pi and a 
touchscreen. The applications I have in mind include inspecting
recordings from my trail cameras. These cameras are installed 
in wet, muddy locations
with no mains electricity supply. 
I'm more familiar with Peli cases for transporting camera
equipment -- they're unremarkable in appearance, but extremely robust.
They're also reasonably waterproof. They do have the disadvantage of being
very expensive, compared to similar-looking brands, but I guess quality
comes at a price.
</p>
<p>
As it happens, I didn't have to design anything myself, because
I found a published design on 
<a href="https://back7.co/home/the-raspberry-pi-quick-kit" target="_blank">
Jay Doscher's website</a>. This design is based on the
<a href="https://peliproducts.co.uk/1150-protector-case" 
target="_blank">Peli 1150 case</a>, and a Raspberry Pi official 7"
touchscreen. The front panel connections are formed from readily-available
(but not cheap) panel-mount extension cables.  
</p>
<p>
Jay helpfully provides STL files ready for the 3D printer (thanks).  
</p>
<p>
My build was delayed because, as I don't own a diamond mine, I had
to wait for a second-hand Peli 1150 to become available on eBay. 
This article recounts my experience of assembling a Pi terminal 
from Jay's design, and
some comments on using this kind of case in general.

</p>

<h2>Printing</h2>
<p>
The whole design is centered on the front panel -- this holds the
touchscreen, which has the Raspberry Pi mounted on its back.
The front Panel is printed in three parts -- the visible panel, 
and two brackets for attaching the touchscreen behind it.
I printed the front panel parts in carbon-reinforced nylon PA12, with no
problems.
The print is almost two-dimensional, so there's not a lot
that can go wrong. The substrate has a gritty, industrial look, which
complements the matte-black case. I thought it would be stiffer than cheaper 
substrates, and it is -- but perhaps not quite stiff enough. If I were
doing this again, I think I'd add a millimetre or so to the thickness of the
front panel. It would add to the cost, of course, but only slightly. I 
don't think it would be necessary to change the shape of the front panel, to
accommodate this extra thickness. 
</p>
<p>
The slight flexibility of the front panel is noticeable because the
glass of the touchscreen is, of course, not flexible at all. So, when
the unit is assembled, there's a small (perhaps 0.5mm) lip between the
front panel and the bottom of the touchscreen glass. The touchscreen
is not fastened to this panel, so I don't think that thickening the panel
would put any extra stress on the screen glass.
</p>
<p>
I should point out that the slight lack of stiffness doesn't affect the
operation of the unit once assembled.
</p>

<h2>Assembly</h2>
<p>
I used this
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08D8VZLQX" target="_blank">panel mount Ethernet extension</a>
and this
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002M8RVKA" target="_blank">panel mount USB extension</a> to bring the Pi Ethernet and USB to the front panel.
On Jay's website he shows the use of a straight Ethernet extension, but I
could only find a right-angle one. The right angle is at the Pi end, and
causes the Ethernet cable to obstruct access to the USB ports. I didn't think
this would be a problem, because I was planning to use only two of the 
USB ports, and use the third front-panel cut-out for an HDMI port. 
As it turns out, though, there wasn't room behind or below the Pi board
to route the HDMI cable. In the end I managed to get three USB cables
and the Ethernet cable into the Pi's sockets, but it wasn't easy, and
I'm not entirely happy with the result. It's definitely better to get
the straight Ethernet adapter, if possible.
</p>
<p>
The biggest problem I had was in attaching the touchscreen to the
front panel. This is done using two brackets which, because of their
thickness, have a small amount of flex in them. The flex here is
probably a good thing, because it prevents shocks to the case being
transmitted directly to the touchscreen glass. The attachment is
fussy though and, although it probably is possible to obtain a self-tapping
screw that would attach the brackets to the front panel, I did not have
one. So in the end I drilled through the front panel and attached the
brackets to the front panel using black M4 nuts and bolts. 
This is a very sturdy fastening,
and adds to the industrial look of the build.
</p>
<p>
I found it quite difficult to centre the touchscreen in the opening in the
front panel -- I never got it perfectly right. I don't think this is a 
fault in the 3D printing -- I think the touchscreen has its mounting holes
a millimetre or so off-centre. Whether all the official 7" touchscreens
are like this, or its a fault in mine, I really couldn't say. In any event,
the discrepancy is not noticeable, because I decided to support the back
of the touchscreen glass using a bead of foam-rubber attached to the 
cut-out in the front panel. Although the semi-rigid mount of the 
screen on the front panel might add to shock resistance, 
I'm worried that I could press hard on the sides of the touchscreen, 
and accidentally
break it, because of the lack of support at the back. The foam bead
provides just enough cushioning to prevent this, while not anchoring
the screen rigidly to the panel. The foam bead also has the effect of
masking the millimetre gap between the touchscreen glass and the panel.

<p>
The front panel forms a completely self-contained unit, and no connections
need to be made to the case itself. The panel just slides into the
case -- but it's an extremely tight fit. It has to be, otherwise the
panel assembly 
would fall out. The design doesn't call for any fastenings between the 
case and the front panel -- it's just a friction fit. The fit is
tight enough that this does kind-of work. It wouldn't be hard to 
make a rigid fastening by putting some fine self-tapping screws through
the case and into the front panel. Unfortunately, there's a lip
around the case at the relevant place that would make it hard to do this
without compromising the waterproofing. 
</p>
<p>
The front-panel design leaves a 4mm hole, which will accommodate a
nut-and-bolt arrangement that stands proud of the panel. This is to yank
the panel out of the case -- and you'll need it, because the fit is
so tight.
</p>
<p>
To be honest, I'm unsure what I think about friction-fitting the
panel into the case like this. It does work, but I suspect that if the case
were dropped, the whole panel could be jolted loose.

<h2>Operation</h2>
<p>
The final build seems pretty solid, and works well out-of-doors when
powered from a car battery via a 12v-5v converter. The unit 
draws as much as 2.5A with
the screen backlight turned up, so you need a more substantial converter
than the cheap nasty ones that are sold as phone chargers. 
</p>
<p>
My main concern about a build like this is ventilation -- that is, the
lack of it. There's s small slot above the touchscreen which seems to be
the only place where air can enter or leave the assembly. Any other
heat loss would have to be by conduction through the case. Of course,
passive ventilation could be improved by drilling ventilation holes in 
the case, but it would be difficult to do that without compromising the
waterproofing.
</p>
<p>
I find that, under full load with the screen backlight on, the
CPU temperature increases by about 35 Celsius. With English weather, this
isn't often going to be a severe problem. In a place where the ambient
temperature can exceed 40 Celsius, you might have to be a bit careful. 
There's really no scope to provide extra ventilation, active
or passive, without puncturing the
case.

  alt="Pi in Peli case 5" width="650px"/>
</p>

<p>
On the subject of waterproofing, I should point out that the finished
build is at best slightly
splash-proof when the case is open. It would be very easy to improve the
waterproofing when open -- ten minutes with a mastic gun would make it
fully submersible. However, opening the unit for maintenance would become
very problematic, and ventilation would be further reduced. 
</p>
<p>
I'd like to build a custom keyboard that will fit in the lid of the Peli
case when it's open, but there's really not a lot of space to play
with. Something like the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4150986"
target="_blank">Gherkin 30% keyboard</a> would fit side-to-side (just),
but it would be too tall. In fact, the depth of the lid is
only just a little larger than a conventional keycap.
</p>
<p>
Although it's not ideal a cheap, folding Bluetooth keyboard fits
comfortably side-to-side, and <i>just</i> fits in height. When the case is
closed, there's just enough clearance to fit a 2mm-thick sheet of foam
between the folded keyboard and the touchscreen; but that's enough to
stop the screen getting scratched. 
</p>

<h2>Further work</h2>
<p>
It would significantly increase the usefulness of the unit if it could
be battery-powered. There's <i>just</i> room, I think, for a charging
circuit and battery in the case -- but it would be a tight squeeze, and
you'd need to fabricate some mounting brackets for the parts. What
puts me off pursuing this further is that my experience is that NiMH
batteries and their chargers tend to get rather hot in use; I'm not
convinced that the case offers enough ventilation. You'd also have to
fit a substantial power switch on the front panel somewhere. 
Connections to at least some of the GPIO pins would also be
useful in some applications. Jay Doscher's website also
shows some designs for larger units, and these might be more appropriate
if you want battery power and external connections to the GPIO. 
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
This isn't a cheap build -- even leaving aside the Peli case, the cost
of parts is about £150. However, I don't think anything remotely like
it is available outside the specialist industrial computing market, where
it would be hugely more expensive.
