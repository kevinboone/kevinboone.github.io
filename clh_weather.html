<h1>Command-line hacking: displaying a weather summary</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/terminal.png" 
  alt="display"/>
This is the first in what I hope will become a series of
articles on doing off-beat and (I hope) interesting things
with standard Linux command-line tools. In this post
I'll give some ideas on retrieving a weather forecast summary
from the BBC's RSS feed, and formatting it nicely.
The idea is that you can just type, for example, 
<code>weather</code> at the prompt, and see a daily weather
summary.
</p>
<p>
The basic strategy will be use <code>curl</code> to retrieve the
weather forecast in RSS (XML) format, <code>xmllint</code> to
extract the relevant parts of the document, <code>sed</code> to
convert the text into <code>groff</code> format, then finally
<code>groff</code> to format it, adding colour and emphasis.
<code>groff</code> is highly configurable and
produces nicely left- and right-justified text. It's easy to
change this layout if required.
</p>
<p>
A quick-and-dirty alternative to using <code>groff</code> would be
to use <code>fmt</code>, and then use <code>sed</code> to insert
terminal escape codes to add the emphasis and colour. But this
isn't very elegant.
</p>
<p>
Disclaimer: I don't claim that the way I go
about solving this problem is the only way, or even the best.
There are many ways to solve the same problem with shell
scripting.
</p>
<p>
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
To follow this example, you'll need <code>curl</code> and <code>groff</code>
(which are part of the base distribution for many Linux variants)
and <code>xmllint</code> (which probably isn't). On Ubuntu and similar, 
you can get
<code>xmllint</code> by running:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ sudo apt-get install libxml2-utils
</pre>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
The basic URL for the BBC's 3-day forecast, in RSS format,
is:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
https://weather-broker-cdn.api.bbci.co.uk/en/forecast/rss/3day/NNNNNN
</pre>

<p>
<code>NNNNNN</code> is a numeric code for the location. So far
as I know, there is no published list of these location codes, and they
don't correspond (to the best of my knowledge) to any geographic
indicator. You can
find the code for your location by looking at 
the <a href="https://bbc.co.uk/weather" target="_blank">BBC weather site</a> and searching for the relevant name.
The numeric code will appear in the URL. In the examples that follow,
I'll be using the code for London, which is 2643743.
</p>

<p>
The following command will request the 3-day weather forecast for
London, and dump it to standard out:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ curl https://weather-broker-cdn.api.bbci.co.uk/en/forecast/rss/3day/2643743
</pre>

<p>
If you examine the output, you'll see the following basic structure:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;rss</font></b> ...<b><font color="#0000FF">&gt;</font></b> 
  <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;channel</font></b> ...<b><font color="#0000FF">&gt;</font></b>
    <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;item&gt;</font></b>
      <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;title&gt;</font></b>Today: Light Cloud...<b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;/title&gt;</font></b>
      <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;description&gt;</font></b>Visibility: Good...<b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;/description&gt;</font></b>
      ...
    <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;/item&gt;</font></b>
    <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;item&gt;</font></b>
      <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;title&gt;</font></b>Friday: Heavy Cloud...<b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;/title&gt;</font></b>
      <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;description&gt;</font></b>Visibility: Poor...<b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;/description&gt;</font></b>
      ...
    <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;/item&gt;</font></b>
    ...
</pre>

<p>
All RSS files are XML with this same layout -- only the content differs.
In this case, there are three &lt;item&gt; elements, one for
each day of the forecast. Each item has a title and a description
which, to some extent, are pre-formatted display. Depending on
the application, it might be sufficient to display only the
"title" element -- the description is a bit wordy. Note
that the title and description are 
intended to be displayed as provided. They do benefit from being
formatted,
though,
and in my example I've added some text highlighting; still, it isn't easy
actually to <i>parse</i> these text strings. Apart from anything else,
the format tends to change, and relying on a particular entry
(e.g., "Visibility") being present is a bad idea.
</p>

<p>
So our task here is to parse the XML, extract the title 
(and perhaps description), and format the results for display in the
terminal. Here's what I'm aiming for:
</p>

 <figcaption>
 <i>
 The output of the script in a Linux terminal. It's easy enough
 to customize the appearance and layout if required.
 </i>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Parsing the XML</h2>
<p>
It would be nice to be able to extract the relevant parts of
the XML file using simple command-line utilities like <code>grep</code>
and <code>sed</code>. Since the structure of the BBC's RSS is so
regular, that's <i>almost</i> possible. We could, for example,
just <code>grep</code> for lines that contain "title" and
"description".
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, there are other lines in the XML that contain 
these tags. Since they tend to occur in the same position,
a quick-and-dirty hack would be to extract specific occurences
by their position in the XML. However, this isn't very robust 
-- and remember that we're working with a file format that
is not documented, and whose layout could change. We need
to ensure that, so long as we get a valid RSS document, we
can display something useful. Consequently, it's necessary to
do real XML parsing to extract the data.
</p>
<p>
The <code>xmllint</code> utility makes this easy, so long as 
the parsing is not too complex. In this case we just want to
extract certain elements, that have well-defined positions in 
the XML's tree structure. This will do the trick:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">curl -s <font color="#990000">[</font>BBC URL<font color="#990000">]</font> <font color="#990000">\</font>
   <font color="#990000">|</font> xmllint --xpath rss/channel/item/title<font color="#990000">\|</font>rss/channel/item/description 
</pre>

<p>
The <code>--xpath</code> switch takes one or more paths, separated
by a vertical bar (pipe). Be careful to prevent the shell treating the 
pipe as an instruction to perform a pipe operation: here I've
escaped it with a backslash but, of course, there are other ways.
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>RSS XML files are usually encoded in UTF-8 format. This is a multi-byte text encoding, whose significance will become apparent later.</blockquote>

<h2>Converting the XML</h2>
<p>
The first task is to strip any remaining XML tags from the text. That's easy
to do with <code>sed</code>
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#990000">|</font> sed -e <font color="#FF0000">'s/&lt;[^&gt;]*&gt;//g'</font>
</pre>

<p>
<code>sed</code> operates on standard input, and outputs to standard output. It
edits the text stream in accordance with the instructions provided on the
command line. In this case, I'm using the <code>s/search/replace/g</code>
instruction, which replaces all instances ('g' for 'global') of the 
pattern with "//" -- that is, nothing. The pattern is a regular expression;
in this case it matches anything starting with "&lt;" and ending in "&gt;",
except for the "&gt;" symbol itself. 
</p>
<p>
<code>sed</code>'s pattern matching is "greedy" by default -- that is,
it will match the <i>longest</i> sequence of characters that it can.
This is why we need the slightly odd pattern described above, and it's a
format that I'll be using repeatedly in this example. We only want to match
the XML tags -- we don't want to match from the start of one tag, right to
the end of the next, which is what will happen if we're not careful.
</p>
<p>
<code>xmllint</code> won't insert any blank lines between the XML sections it 
extracts. The
text of the BBC weather feed contains no line breaks of its own, but we will
need to break the lines later so they fit nicely on the screen. But first,
we need to insert our own line breaks between each day's weather forecast,
forming a blank line. That is, each days's forecast will be followed by a blank
line. If we don't do that, when we format the text using <code>groff</code>, it
will want to merge all the lines together, and then format the whole chunk.
To change a line break into a blank line, I'm doing this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#990000">|</font> tr <font color="#FF0000">'</font><font color="#CC33CC">\n</font><font color="#FF0000">'</font> <font color="#FF0000">'#'</font> <font color="#990000">\</font>
<font color="#990000">|</font> sed -e <font color="#FF0000">'s/#/</font><font color="#CC33CC">\n\n</font><font color="#FF0000">/g'</font> <font color="#990000">\</font>
</pre>

<p>
<code>sed</code> won't easily match on, or convert, end-of-line marks. So, instead
I'm using <code>tr</code> to translate these into hash (#) characters, and
then <code>sed</code> to translate these into pairs of newlines. Of course,
this won't work if the text actually contains hash characters of its own --
you'd have to pick a different symbol.
</p>

<p>
My personal preference is to remove the Fahrenheit temperatures that
the BBC feed provides, and just keep 
the Celcius. Your preference may differ, of course.
The Fahrenheit temperatures appear in brackets:
"(38°F)". To remove these:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#990000">|</font> sed -e <font color="#FF0000">'s/ (.*F)//g'</font> <font color="#990000">\</font>
</pre>

<p>
Again, I know that this pattern doesn't appear anywhere else in the text, so
it's safe to match it this way. Note that I'm removing the extra space
that appears in front of the opening bracket but, in fact,
<code>groff</code> will do that later, anyway.
</p>

<p>
In my script I carry out a number of other simple transformations: shortening
long words, that kind of thing. I'm not going to describe these in detail
because they just use the same application of <code>sed</code> as the
previous steps..
However, there are a few things that merit explanation.
</p>

<p>
In my script, I display the names of the days (which include "Today" and
"Tonight") in red, to make the sections of the output easier to distinguish. 
Since
I'll be processing the text with <code>groff</code>, I want to surround these
words with <code>groff</code> colour codes. These are a bit arcance but,
essentially, we need <code>\m[name]</code> to set the colour, followed by
<code>\m[]</code> to set it back to the default.
</p>

<p>
My way of making this change isn't very elegant:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#990000">|</font> sed -e <font color="#FF0000">'s/Tonight</font><font color="#CC33CC">\|</font><font color="#FF0000">Today</font><font color="#CC33CC">\|</font><font color="#FF0000">Monday</font><font color="#CC33CC">\|</font><font color="#FF0000">Tuesday</font><font color="#CC33CC">\|</font><font color="#FF0000">Wednesday\</font>
<font color="#CC33CC">\|</font><font color="#FF0000">Thursday</font><font color="#CC33CC">\|</font><font color="#FF0000">Friday</font><font color="#CC33CC">\|</font><font color="#FF0000">Saturday</font><font color="#CC33CC">\|</font><font color="#FF0000">Sunday/</font><font color="#CC33CC">\\</font><font color="#FF0000">m[red]</font><font color="#CC33CC">\0\\</font><font color="#FF0000">m[]/g'</font> <font color="#990000">\</font>
</pre>

<p>
Since the day name is always the first token on a line, there ought to be a more
elegant way to match it. However, it isn't the first token on <i>every</i>
line. All the other ways I found to match this text were no less ugly, so
I'm keeping what I have until somebody suggests a better way.
</p>
<p>
Note that in the replacement text, <code>\0</code> means "substitute the 
text that matched". Because the backslash character has a specific meaning
to <code>sed</code>, when we want an actual backslash in the output, we have 
to write <code>\\</code>. It's this kind of fiddly that makes text-processing
scripts so unreadable, but there isn't really an alternative.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, <code>sed</code> can take multiple operations on the same
command line. They are separated by semicolons. This is quicker, but
a <code>sed</code> command with dozens of operations on the same line is
profoundly unreadable (rather than just very unreadable). 
So I've used sequential invocations of <code>sed</code>
with one operation each.
</p>
<p>
I've used a similar technique as the above to add other kinds of emphasis.
To make text bold, for example, we surround it by the <code>groff</code>
codes <code>\fB</code> and <code>\fR</code> ("format bold" and "format regular").
Again, we need to be careful about escaping the backslashes when 
writing these codes in a script.
</p>

<h2>Formatting the text</h2>
<p>
Finally, we're (almost) ready to pass the converted text, with its embedded formatting
codes, to <code>groff</code>. First, though, we need to add a recognizable
character or character sequence to the start of each blank line.
I'm using "###", but anything that we can be sure won't otherwise appear is fine.
</p>
<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#990000">|</font> sed -e <font color="#FF0000">'s/^$/###</font><font color="#CC33CC">\n</font><font color="#FF0000">/'</font> <font color="#990000">\</font>
</pre>

<p>
The reason for doing this is that <code>groff</code> always seems to pad its
output with a bunch of blank lines -- I haven't found a way to stop it doing
that when outputting plain text. We need to strip those blank lines, but
we don't want to strip the blank lines that we <i>inserted</i> earlier to
separate the different days. Marking the "real" blank lines with a
specific pattern will allow us to do that.
</p>
<p>
The <code>groff</code> invocation looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#990000">|</font> groff -k -Tutf<font color="#993399">8</font> -man <font color="#990000">\</font>
</pre>

<p>
The Linux version of <code>groff</code> can not (so far as I know) handle
multi-byte input -- it assumes each character is a single byte. The BBC RSS
feed does produce multi-byte characters. In particular, there is the "degree"
sign, which isn't an ASCII character. The <code>-k</code> argument tells
<code>groff</code> to run a pre-processor that converts multi-byte
characters into <code>groff</code> formatting codes. Since most Linux
systems use UTF-8 character encoding, and the RSS format is UTF-8, no
other configuration is necessary to make this conversion.
</p>

<p>
The <code>-Tutf8</code> switch allows UTF-8 <i>output</i>. <code>-man</code>
is an instruction to format in a way that is suitable for a Unix
<code>man</code> page; essentially, that means for output on a text terminal.
</p>

<h2>Tidying up</h2>
<p>
The final step is to remove the spare, empty lines added by <code>groff</code>,
and then convert the "real" empty lines we marked using the tag "###"
with real blank lines.
</p>
<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#990000">|</font> sed <font color="#FF0000">'/^$/d'</font> <font color="#990000">\</font>
<font color="#990000">|</font> sed <font color="#FF0000">'s/###/</font><font color="#CC33CC">\n</font><font color="#FF0000">/g'</font>
</pre>

<h2>Further work</h2>
<p>
The simple script could be improved in many ways. Of course, the formatting of
the output won't be to everybody's taste. It would be relatively easy to
provide the script with command-line arguments so that you could select
the forecast location, or change the amount of data that is displayed. The
BBC also provides an RSS feed of current weather observations, rather than
forecasts, and it could easily be parsed and formatted with the same approach
-- and much of the same code -- I've described above.
</p>
<p>
Another, slightly useful enhancement would be to suppress the generation of
terminal formatting characers if the output is <i>not</i> to a terminal.
