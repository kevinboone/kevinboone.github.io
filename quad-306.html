don’t make them like that any more: the Quad 306 amplifier</h1>
<p><img src="img/quad-306.jpg" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>British electronics company Quad was known mostly for its signature
electrostatic loudspeakers – monstrous, window-sized slabs with brass
mesh grills – but it also did a good business in amplifiers and other
hifi equipment. The 306 was more-or-less the last product released by
the Company under the auspices of its founder, Peter Walker, and
probably the best.</p>
<p>The 306 is a power amplifier. It has no controls except an on/off
switch, and no connections except input, speakers, and mains. When it
was released in 1987 you’d use it with a preamplifier, which had the
actual controls, and a bunch of separate audio sources. These days you’d
probably do the same, but it’s perfectly possible to connect the Quad
306 directly to the output of a computer’s soundcard, and it will work
fine.</p>
<p>Walker notoriously said that the perfect power amplifier is “a wire
with gain”. That is, the amplifier should make the electrical signal
larger, but not modify it in any other way. Such a goal is difficult to
achieve, and there’s been much discussion about whether it’s even worth
attempting. Still, the design goal of the 306, and it’s predecessor the
405 range (yes, Quad product naming was bizarre) was for the amplifier
to be as transparent as possible. Any modification to the audio
properties would be done elsewhere.</p>
<p>Whether that was a laudable goal in 1987 is debatable, but it’s
certainly a laudable goal <em>now</em>: with digital signal processing
technology we can now make pretty-much anything sound like anything
else. There’s little need for an amplifier to do more than enlarge.</p>

<p>The 306 could, in principle, produce a constant 50 watts into two
8-ohm speakers. Music being what it is, that meant in practice about ten
watts, with the extra power reserved for peaks. It was, and remains,
plenty loud in a domestic setting. The case was comparatively small for
the time, and there were no cooling fans. So heat management was by a
substantial heat sink, mounted unconventionally on the front. The whole
unit was a dull, industrial grey, at a time when brushed aluminium was
all the rage. Certainly it looked businesslike.</p>
<p>Mounting the heat sink on the front makes sense, from a technical
perspective, because there was little else on the front panel. The rear
had all the connections, so a rear heat sink could not have been as
large, and the wiring would have been complicated. The internal layout
of the 306 is, in fact, very simple.</p>

<p>All the electronics are mounted on a single, single-sided printed
circuit board. It’s relatively easy to dismantle the whole thing for
servicing and modifications. And there was plenty of modification, from
simple upgrades to the speaker sockets, to radical changes to the
electronics.</p>
<p>A notable factor about the design is the small number of electrolytic
capacitors. There are only four – the massive power smoothing
capacitors. They have to be this large to store the energy needed to
deliver powerful transients – the thump of a bass drum, for example.
Minimizing the number of electrolytic capacitors matters because these
devices change their electrical properties as they age.</p>
<p>Quad made much of the fact that the electronic design was
non-critical in its component choices. If you replaced, for example, a
95-ohm resistor with a 110-ohm resistor it wouldn’t do any harm. Because
resistors were not made to tight tolerances in the 1980s – cheap ones
still are not – this lack of fussiness was important for
maintenance.</p>
<p>You might also notice that there are <em>no</em> internal adjustments
of any kind. Either the 306 works perfectly straight from the assembly
line, or it doesn’t work at all. The basic electronic design principle
was called by Quad ‘current dumping’. It’s a principle that lends itself
to unfussy component selection and layout.</p>
<p>A hifi power amplifier was a relatively specialist piece of equipment
in the 80s, as it is now. Then, as now, only enthusiasts with plenty of
funds would assemble a hifi system from separate components; everybody
else had some sort of ‘music centre’ that integrated everything
together. ‘Everything’ in 1987 might have included a CD player but, for
most people, good-quality music sources were FM radio and vinyl records.
Plebs like me played cassette tapes, but real enthusiasts scorned such
things, just as they scorned the ‘music centres’, which generally were
cheap and nasty, and sounded awful.</p>
<p>So anybody who wanted a separate power amplifier in the 80s would
expect to have to pay in hard coin: the 306 cost about £1500 in 2024
money. Looking inside one, it’s pretty clear that it doesn’t contain
£1500’s worth of components. Presumably some of that money went into the
design process, but it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that some of it
went into the name: Quad was a prestige brand in the 70s and 80s.
Everybody with an interest in hifi knew about Quad, just as everybody
with an interest in cars knew about Jaguar.</p>
<p>If you spend such a lot of money on an amplifier, you’re probably
going to find that it sounds good. But the one I bought for £40 ten
years ago sounded pretty good as well. I sold it because it, and the
additional equipment that went with it, was too large for the shelf in
my office. The Denon compact system I replaced it with was a lot more
convenient, and a space-saver, but it didn’t sound so good.</p>
<p>Of course, the 306 wasn’t perfect. An obvious, irritating problem was
that it was all too easy to trip the over-current protection by playing
it too loud. The protective device did not auto-reset – you had to grope
around behind the stack of hifi equipment to find the tiny reset button
on the back of the 306. But probably the worst fault was that the
enormous mains transformer wasn’t mounted on the chassis, but on the
printed circuit board. If you dropped the amplifier, there was a good
chance that you’d crack the circuit board. This was repairable, but not
easily.</p>
<p>Given how good the 306 was, it’s not obvious why it wasn’t more of a
success. In fact, by 1987, Quad’s amplifier business was already in
decline. According to Ken Kessler’s book <em>Quad: The Closest
Approach</em>, the 405-2 – the predecessor of the 306 – sold about
100,000 units. The 306 and all the amplifiers that came after it did not
sell that many together.</p>
<p>I suspect that part of the reason for the decline was the increased
popularity of CD players. One of the things that CDs taught us was that
an amplifier probably wasn’t the limiting factor in sound quality. If
you had half-decent speakers and a CD player, even an inexpensive
amplifier could sound pretty good. Not as good, perhaps, as a top-flight
unit, but good enough for most people.</p>
<p>At the same time, the quality of integrated hifi systems started to
improve. It was, and remains, possible to get bettter sound from
carefully chosen, separate components; but the difference gets smaller
every year. My Denon compact system included a CD player and DAB/FM/AM
radio along with the amplifier and speakers, and it still cost only a
quarter as much as a Quad 306.</p>
<p>If you want a Quad 306 today – and I strongly recommend it – you can
pick up a reasonable one from an on-line auction sites for about £200.
You should probably replace the huge capacitors if the previous owner
did not, because capacitors of that size don’t age well. You should also
check the PCB for cracks at the same time. With these simple things
taken care of, the 306 will probably outlive you, and still be sounding
great when it does.</p>
