<h1>Why "RMS watts" is a useless measure of power</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/notes.gif" alt="musical notes"/>
Manufacturers of hifi equipment -- particularly amplifiers and 
loudspeakers -- frequently refer to power in terms of
"RMS watts", or "watts RMS". In this article I will explain that
this is a meaningless measure of power, which does not represent
anything of interest in the physical world. 
</p>

<p>
It is my hope that the designers of electronic equipment know this
perfectly well, and that it is merely a marketing strategy: 
perhaps it creates an aura of technical authenticity to write "RMS" 
on the end of every number. Whatever the explanation, this practice
is widespread, and unnecessary, as I will explain. 
</p>

<p>
There's a bit of math in this article, because I want it to be
reasonably rigorous -- I'm not just <i>claiming</i> that it makes
no sense to express a power as an RMS value: I'm proving it.
If you have no interest in the math, that shouldn't be a problem --
I think the argument is carried without it. However, I do assume
some basic knowledge of electricity. If you don't know what an amp
is, you might consider reading my 
<a href="electricity.html">ten-minute guide to electrical theory</a>
first.
</p>

<h2>The origin of the problem</h2>

<p>In electronic engineering it is common to refer to alternating
currents, and the voltages associated with them, using "RMS" values.
RMS stands for "root mean square", and is a representation of the 
energy or power associated with the signal, which may have an average value
which is, in fact, zero.</p>

<p>
Consider the two standard sinewave voltages 
shown below.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/rms1.png" 
  alt="two votlage waveforms" /> 
</p>


<p>
The red voltage waveform is clearly "larger", in terms of amplitude,
than the blue waveform and,
all else being equal, will be associated with a larger amount of
energy. But both waveforms have an <i>average</i> amplitude of 
zero. Clearly, in order to compare the energies (or powers)
associated with these two waveforms, we need something more than
a simple average.  
</p>

<p>
What we could do is to take the absolute value of the waveform, that 
is, invert the negative part of it. The resulting waveform would be
positive everywhere, and would have a non-zero average. This average
calculated for the red waveform would be larger than that of the
blue waveform, so we seem to have a valid measure.
</p>

<p>
In practice, when discussing alternating currents and voltages, we
typically use the RMS measure, not the average of the absolute 
value of the amplitude, or any other representative figure. 
The reason for this is related to the fact that 
voltages and currents multiply to give power, as I shall explain.
</p>

<h2>Power, voltage, and current</h2>

<p>
In general, the power delivered to any electronic component
<i>at some instant in time</i> is equal to the voltage measured
across it, multiplied by the current flowing through it. This applies
to loudspeakers, motors, lightbulb filaments -- everything that conducts
electricity. Power, like voltage and current, is a time-varying quantity.
Mathematically we make this time-dependence explicit like this:
</p>

$$ P(t) = I(t) V(t) $$ 

<p>
Where <i>P</i>, <i>I</i>, and <i>V</i>, are power, current, and voltage,
and all vary with time, <i>t</i>.
If the electrical device is a resistor, or behaves like a resistor, we
can derive the power just from the voltage, or just from the current,
since we know from Ohm's law that 
</p>

$$ V(t) = I(t) R $$ 

<p>
The resistance, <i>R</i>, does not have a "(t)" suffix, because it
is not time-varying (usually). Combining the two previous formulae 
we can write the expression for power in terms of voltage: 
</p>

$$ P(t) =  \frac{V(t)^2}{R} $$ 

<p>
Since a loudspeaker behaves <i>somewhat</i> like a resistance, we can
at least estimate the speaker power from the amplifier's output voltage,
given an estimate of the speaker resistance. You might notice from
the previous formula that the power decreases with resistance. So,
all else being equal, doubling the speaker resistance will halve the
power delivered to it. This is why the output power of amplifiers will
usually be specified for a particular speaker resistance -- typically
eight ohms. 
</p>

<p>
Voltage and current are both time-varying waveforms, and the current
and voltage in a particular component may have peaks at different
times. This won't happen in a resistor, but it
may happen with more complex components. A loudspeaker coil, in particular,
has capacitance and inductance, as well as resistance. When an alternating
current
flows through a loudspeaker its voltage and current peaks will not,
in general, be coincident. The result is to make the average
power delivered less than a simple calculation would predict. 
The amount by which it differs is known as the <i>power factor</i>, and
is a really big deal when working with electric motors. In what
follows, I will be assuming that the loudspeaker is, for all practical
purposes, a resistor, and ignoring such subtleties. 
</p>
<p>
Like voltage and current, the power at any point in time
<i>may be negative</i>. The distinction between positive and
negative current indicates whether current is flowing in
one direction or another. The same is true for power: 
positive or negative power indicates whether power is being
consumed by, or supplied by, some component. 
</p>
<p>
But -- and this is important -- a loudspeaker is
<i>on average</i> a consumer of electrical power. The
average current and average voltage in a loudspeaker
may average to zero (as in the sinewaves show above), 
but over time power
<i>must flow from the amplifier to the loudspeaker</i>.
</p>
<p>
It doesn't really matter whether we call that direction of
power flow the "positive" or the "negative" direction, so long
as it's an overall flow of power to the speaker. Otherwise, the
speaker won't make any noise.
</p>
<p>
In fact, if the loudspeaker behaves as a resistor, then the
<i>instantaneous</i> power, as well as the average power, will
always be positive. This can be seen from the expression
for power in terms of voltage above -- the voltage is squared,
so it can never be negative, not even for an instant.
</p>
<p>
What all this means is that, although average voltage and average
current may not give a meaningful representation of the energy
associated with a signal, that is not true for power:
<i>average power</i> is a meaningful measure. In fact, it's the only
useful measure: it is the average power that will tell us how hot the
speaker coil and the amplifier's output stage will get.
</p>
<p>
The graph below shows the voltage, current, and power in a loudspeaker
with 8-ohm resistance, with the peak amplifier output being
10V. This means that the peak current is 10/8 = 1.25A, and the peak
power 10*1.25 = 12.5W. 
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/rms2.png" alt="Relationship between power, voltage, and current"
  width="650px"/>
</p>

<p>
The average power does not even need to be calculated -- it's simply
half the peak power, 6.25W, as can be seen from the graph. 
</p>
<p>
So an expression for the average power, given peak
current and voltage, is:
</p>

$$ P_{average} = \frac{I_{peak} V_{peak}}{2} $$

<p>
(for a sinewave).
We don't need anything more than a simple average to describe
amplifier or speaker power. 
</p>

<h2>Understanding the RMS amplitude</h2>

<p>
What, then, is an RMS amplitude, and 
where is it actually useful?
</p>
<p>
To get the RMS value of a signal, we square the amplitude and
take the average of the squared value. Then we take the square root
of the result. The squaring operation produces a value which is 
always positive, whatever the original voltage or current. The
square root returns the value to the same scale as the original
signal. It's important to understand that the RMS value is a
representation of the overall energy in the waveform; 
unlike the original signal, it is <i>not</i>
time-varying.
</p>
<p>
The RMS amplitude will, of course, be related to the peak value of
the signal. In fact, it will be proportional: doubling the peak
amplitude doubles the RMS amplitude. However, the RMS amplitude is
not dictated only by the peak amplitude -- it depends on the shape
of the waveform. For some waveforms it's possible to work out the
RMS amplitude by common sense; in most cases, however, it requires
some math.
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>Math alert!  If you have no interest in calculus, you can skip this section -- I'm just including it for completeness.</blockquote> 

<p>For any time-varying voltage <i>V</i>(<i>t</i>), the RMS voltage is
given (by definition) by the expression</p>

$$ V_{rms} = \sqrt {\frac{1}{T} \int_0^{T} V(t)^2 \, dt} $$ 

<p>An alternative formulation, for signals that are periodic and can
be expressed in terms of a phase angle <i>&theta;</i> that varies from
0 to 2<i>&pi;</i> is</p>

$$ V_{rms} = \sqrt {\frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} V(\theta)^2 \, d\theta} $$ 

<p>The two formulations are equivalent for periodic waveforms, 
but the second may be 
more useful for trigonometric functions such as the sinewave. 
Even if the integration is meaningless to you, you should recognize
the "root" and the "square" elements of these expressions.
</p>
<p>
As an example, consider a simple
sinewave, that starts with amplitude 0 at <i>&theta;</i>=0, and has
a peak amplitude of 1V. We can write this waveform mathematically as 
</p>  

$$ V(\theta) = sin (\theta) $$

<p>
The RMS value is then given by the following calculation. 
</p>

\begin{aligned}
V_{rms} &= \sqrt {\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_0^{2\pi} sin^2 \theta \, d\theta} \\
        &= \sqrt {\frac{1}{2 \pi} [\frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{1}{4} \, sin {2\theta}]^{2\pi}_0} \\
        &= \sqrt {\frac{1}{2 \pi} [(\frac{2\pi}{2})] } \\
        &= \sqrt {\frac{1}{2} } = 0.7071...
\end{aligned} 

<p>
What this result shows is that the RMS amplitude of a sinewave is
the peak amplitude divided by the square root of 2. Alternatively,
the peak amplitude is the RMS amplitude multiplied by square root
of 2.
</p>

<h2>Why the RMS amplitude is sometimes useful</h2>

<p>
Let's return to the expression for average power we derived earlier:
</p>

$$ P_{average} = \frac{I_{peak} V_{peak}}{2} $$

<p>
I now assert -- but I'm not going to prove -- that average power is
related to <i>RMS</i> voltage and current in an even simpler
way:
</p>

$$ P_{average} = I_{rms} V_{rms} $$

<p>
That is, regardless of waveform, the <b>average power can be calculated
by multiplying the RMS current by the RMS voltage</b>. It's easy to
see that this is true for the sinewave voltage we considered earlier:
</p>

\begin{aligned}

P_{average} &= I_{rms} V_{rms} \\
            &= \frac{I_{peak}}{\sqrt{2}} \frac{V_{peak}}{\sqrt{2}} \\
            &= \frac{I_{peak} V_{peak}}{2} 

\end{aligned} 

<p>
However, the relationship expressed in terms of RMS voltage and
current holds regardless of the waveform.
</p>
<p>
So this is why RMS voltage and RMS current are useful: we can use then
to calculate the <i>average</i> power, which is the power we are
concerned about.
</p>

<h2>So what actually is an RMS watt?</h2>

<p>
The problem we have here is that it is, in fact, possible to work out the
RMS amplitude of a power, even though it's unnecessary and it has
no physical meaning. The formula for RMS amplitude can be applied
to any quantity, whether it makes sense to do so or not. So when
a manufacturer says that its amplifier outputs "50W RMS", what does
that mean?
</p>
<p>
Who knows? Probably what the manufacturer actually means is
"50W average", but thinks that "RMS" looks more technical. After all,
an RMS measure is a "kind of" average. It's only a kind of average,
though -- it's not actually an average. The manufacturer might mean
"50W as determined by measuring the RMS voltage", which is a legitimate
way to measure power (if the load is resistive). 
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, it is <i>possible</i> to work out a power in RMS watts --
it doesn't mean anything, but it's a little larger than the true, average
power. My experience is that amplifier manufacturers don't need any
additional excuses to tell fibs about their products,
but I guess every little helps.
</p>
<p>
The <i>correct</i> way to specify the maximum output power of an
amplifier, for the purpose of comparing amplifiers, is to state the
<i>average</i> power that can be sustained indefinitely, with both
stereo channels driving 8-ohm loads. There's no need for "RMS" to
appear anywhere in this formulation.
