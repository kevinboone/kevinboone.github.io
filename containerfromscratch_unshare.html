<h1>Container from scratch: Using unshare to provide private namespaces</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/tuxes.png" 
  alt="Tux logo"/>
In the <a href="containerfromscratch_chroot.html">previous article in this series</a> I demonstrated how to sandbox the container's filesystem 
using <code>chroot</code>. I explained how to use a minimal Linux 
distribution -- Alpine -- in a way that is analogous to an 'image'
in established container technologies. 
</p>
<p>
The demonstration in this article builds directly on the previous one;
if you're interested in following along, please bear this in mind.
If you don't have the <code>container</code> directory and scripts
from the previous article, none of what follows will make sense.
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
Modern Linux kernels support <i>process namespaces</i>.
A namespace is that set of specific kernel entities
of a particular type that a process sees. These entities include:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the process list</p></li>
<li><p>network interfaces, IP numbers, routes, etc;</p></li>
<li><p>filesystem mount points</p></li>
<li><p>network identify -- host and domain names</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
There are other types of namespace, but these are the ones
that will be manipulated in the demonstrations that follow.
<code>man unshare</code> should give you the full list.
</p>

<p>
Although, by default, all processes run in the same namespace, 
it's possible to provide any process with one or more private namespaces.
This is what the <code>unshare</code> utility does.
</p>

<h2>Demonstration</h2>

<p>
In this demonstration, I will show how to isolate the container's
network identity, process table, and mount points, and make them independent
of the host. Networking in
general is something that requires a separate article, because it's
somewhat more complicated.
</p>
<p>
In the previous article I described how to set up the container's
filesystem, and to run a shell inside the container using a script:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"># chroot container /bin/start.sh
</pre>

<p>
Providing the container with private network identify, mount
points, and process table is very straightforward; just run it
under the control of <code>unshare</code>, like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"># unshare -mpfu chroot container /bin/start.sh
</pre>

<p>
The <code>-f</code> ("fork") option is crucial here. This option 
causes <code>unshare</code> to detach from the process it is
running (<code>start.sh</code> in this case). If this isn't done,
we end up with two processes both trying to be process 1 in the
container, and a spiteful and confusing error message (try it).
</p>

<p>
Inside the container, run <code>ps</code>:
<p>

<pre class="codeblock">$ ps
   1 -sh
</pre>

<p>
There's a single process running, and -- by definition -- its
process ID is '1'. You might be wondering what the process ID
<i>really</i> is, that is, what it is outside the container.
It's not very easy to tell with a process called "sh", because
there could be dozens of processes called "sh" outside
the container as well the one inside. So let's run a process in the container
that will be easier to find.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">$ nc -l &
$ ps -ef | grep nc
   11 myuser    0:00 nc -l
</pre>

<p>
<code>nc</code> is a utility for general network testing -- we'll
need this later when discussing network configuration. For now,
note that the <code>nc</code> process has ID 11 in the container
(on this occasion).
</p>

<p>
Now look for the <code>nc</code> process from the host 
(that is, outside the container shell):
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">$ ps -ef | grep "nc -l"
2000      2501  2381  0 14:55 pts/1    00:00:00 nc -l
</pre>

<p>
There's nothing particularly remarkable here -- processes
in the container <i>do</i> have their counterparts in the global
process table: we'd hardly expect it to be otherwise.
</p>
<p>
The process ID in the host's namespce is 2501 in this case, 
and the owner of the process
is user 2000. There is no user 2000 in the host's <code>/etc/passwd</code>
-- this number only maps onto a name in the container. We've already
seen that the container renders the username correctly; In the host
we just see the numeric process ID.
</p>

<p>
So that's processes. Now let's look at network identify.
</p>
<p>
Exit the container shell, and modify 
the <code>start.sh</code> script so that it sets the 
hostname before executing the shell (or anywhere else -- it
doesn't matter). This is, add something like:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">hostname mycontainer 
</pre>

<p>
'mycontainer' isn't an imaginative hostname, but it will do for purposes
of demonstration.
</p>

<p>
Now start the container shell again, and check the hostname. It should
be 'mycontainer' -- but the host system's hostname is unaffected.
</p>
<p>
It's worth repeating that, although <code>unshare</code> has provided
the container with a separate network identify, it is still using
the network interfaces from the host. Running <code>ip addr list</code>
will make that clear. Although we've set the container's hostname, that
hostname doesn't map onto a network interface, so it isn't good for much.
For proper network isolation we will need to
tackle the much more complicated subject of virtual networking
-- later.
</p>
<p>
Finally, let's look at filesystem mounts.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">$ mount
dev on /dev type devtmpfs (rw,seclabel,relatime,size=16132272k,...)
sys on /sys type sysfs (rw,seclabel,relatime)
proc on /proc type proc (rw,relatime)
</pre>

<p>
Note that the only mounts visible are the ones made by the 
<code>start.sh</code> script. The host's mounts -- of which there
are probably many more -- are not visible. 
</p>

<h2>Some things to watch out for</h2>

<p>
With a combination of <code>unshare</code> and <code>chroot</code> we
can get much of what is required from a container -- a private, sandboxed
filesystem, and container-specific namespaces. It's possible, however,
to overestimate the level of isolation provided by these techniques --
quite apart from sharing network interfaces with the host, a subject we haven't even broached yet.
</p>
<p>
In the end, a container isn't a virtual machine -- it's just a bunch
of processes linked by particular cgroups and namespaces. This
means, for example, that you can't get container-specific measures
of CPU or I/O load, even though these figures do exist for individual
processes.
</p>
<p>
For a specific example, try running <code>cat /proc/loadavg</code>
from within the container. You'll see exactly the same values
as you would if you ran this command outside the container -- even
though the container's processes may be contributing little
or nothing to the overall load.
</p>
<p>
This observation does not result from any limitation of the method
we're using to create the container -- you'll see exactly the
same thing if you log into a Docker or podman container and do
the same test. This is no surprise, since these frameworks are using
exactly the same technologies. What's different, though, is that 
when we build a
container from scratch, it's much clearer what the limitations of
the techniques really area.
</p>

<h3>A note on rootless containers</h3>
<p>
Until now, we've been running the container as <code>root</code>.
I said in an earlier article that it was necessary to be
a privileged user to run <code>chroot</code>, but that's not
strictly true. We can run <code>chroot</code> as an ordinary user
by making user of <i>user namespaces</i>. 
</p>
<p>
'User' is one of the other namespace classes that
<code>unshare</code> can create, and which I haven't discussed
until now. In a user namespace, user and group IDs in the 
container are mapped onto different user IDs and groups in the
host. If we use the <code>-r</code> switch to <code>unshare</code>
this sets up a mapping from the user running the utility, to
the user ID 0. With ID 0, <code>chroot</code> will succeed.
</p>
<p>
So try this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">$ unshare -Urmupf chroot container /bin/start.sh
mycontainer:/#
</pre>

<p>
You'll get a bunch of error messages because, seen from inside 
the new user namespace, the files in the <code>container</code>
directory do not belong to the user running the shell. 
You can fix this by setting the ownership of all the files in the
<code>container</code> directory to that of the current (unprivileged)
user. 
</p>
<p>
This provides a way to run a container with no <code>root</code>
privileges at all -- we don't need to become <code>root</code>,
and we don't need any files to be owned by root (although they
appear to be owned by <code>root</code> from inside the container).
That you're running as <code>root</code> in the container is, essentially,
an illusion -- but one that can be very useful.
</p>
<p>
So we have a truly "rootless" container, of the kind that podman
can create. 
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, there are some limitations to this technique. 
In particular, the <code>unshare</code> command-line utility
is not sophisticated enough to set up the kind of user and
group mappings that would be needed for a genuinely useful
container. The manual page describes the "-r" switch as
"merely a convenience feature", which it is. It doesn't take
much C code to set up more useful mappings, but I promised at the
outset that we would set up a container using command-line tools
only.
</p>
<p>
If you run a container as <code>root</code>, and without a user namespace, 
then <code>root</code>
inside the container is <code>root</code> in the host. The other private
namespaces and the <code>chroot</code> sandbox limit the harm that a
rogue container could do, but there's still the option for the container
to operate directly on devices in <code>/dev</code>, for example. 
The way to prevent this kind of problem is for the container to switch
to an unprivileged user as soon into the start-up process as
possible -- which is what my <code>start.sh</code> script does.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, user namepsaces are not without security problems of their
own -- not because of flaws in the implementation, but because the lead
developers to feel a false sense of security.
