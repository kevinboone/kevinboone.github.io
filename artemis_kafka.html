<h1>ActiveMQ/Artemis or Kafka for Java messaging?</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/activemq-logo.png" 
  alt="ActiveMQ logo"/>
The Java Messaging Services (JMS) Specification has been around for over 
twenty years. It provided, and continues to provide, a
systematic way for Java application components to communicate with one
another asynchronously. 
JMS provides for both first-in, first-out ('queue') and multicast ('topic')
messaging semantics. It has support for transactions, so multiple messaging
operations on the same message broker could be made to succeed or fail
atomically. 
Almost all application servers developed in the last twenty years include
a JMS-compliant message broker; indeed, the J(2)EE specification requires
them to.
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>In this article, 'messaging' refers, essentially, to interprocess communication, rather than to telephony or email.</blockquote> 

<p>
Apache Kafka became widely available about ten years ago, although it's
only in the last few years that it's become as prominent and popular
as it now is. 
Kafka is also an interprocess communication broker written in
Java,
with many superficial similarities to existing JMS message brokers,
but it does not implement the JMS Specification. 
</p>
<p>
Since its introduction, Kafka has become a viable alternative to 
a JMS broker for many applications, and the use of JMS brokers
has declined a little.
At the time of writing, if you want a Java-based, open-source message broker,
your choice is essentially between Apache Kafka, and Apache ActiveMQ
 -- either the earlier 'classic' or the new 'Artemis' release. Compared
with Kafka, both these flavours of ActiveMQ are essentially the same, and
I will mostly treat them as equivalent article.
</p>

<p>
There are, of course, proprietary JMS-compliant message brokers. IBM
Websphere MQ (formerly MQ Series) continues to have a loyal following,
for example. In this article I focus on open-source message
brokers 
but, in fact, the same considerations mostly apply to proprietary 
offerings as well.
</p>

<h2>What this article is about</h2>
<p>
There are many middleware applications whose interprocess communication
requirements could
be logically satisfied using either Kafka or a JMS message broker. 
For these applications,
the choice which to use comes down to pragmatic considerations:
throughput, reliability, ease of maintenance, availability of support.
</p>
<p>
However, Kafka is not a JMS-compliant broker and, in many applications,
developers will have to choose
one or the other. Trying to use Kafka in an application
that requires the flexibility of JMS will lead to frustration. Trying to get
the raw throughput of Kafka from a JMS-compliant broker is likely to
be impracticable.
</p>
<p>
In this article, I try to outline how Kafka is different from a JMS message
broker -- ActiveMQ in particular -- and why you might choose 
which to use. I've divided the article
into discrete topics, but they aren't in any particular order -- their
relative 
importance will depend on the application.
</p>

<h2>Fault tolerance and message continuity</h2>
<p>
In the enterprise, we need messaging systems to be able to survive predictable
failures. We usually provide fault tolerance using some measure
of redundancy -- we run multiple message brokers, and provide a way for
their clients to switch from one to another in the event of a broker failure.
This kind of <i>service-level</i> redundancy isn't hard to implement.
</p>

<p>
Service-level redundancy is not usually sufficient, however. 
We nearly always need some measure of message continuity. That is, we
need clients to receive the same messages in the event of a failure, that they
would have received, had the failure not occurred.
</p>

<p>
To achieve this continuity, we usually replicate
message data on multiple servers.
One of the great strengths of Kafka is that it included a robust replication
system from the very start. When 
a client sends a message to a Kafka broker, it will be replicated to
one or more additional brokers before the sending client receives 
a success signal.
This replication system allows for a measure of asynchronicity, so that the
replication isn't necessarily part of the critical path of the messaging
interaction. In practice, though, Kafka administrators usually define
replication to be synchronous. 
</p>

<p>
Kafka does not require all the brokers to be completely synchronized to
one another for
the cluster to be considered 'in sync'. The administrator may
stipulate, for example, that two out of three brokers have to be
in sync for the system to be considered fully synchronized. 
</p>

<p>
In short, the replication system that Kafka uses is well-documented, and
implications of particular configuration choices are reasonably clear. 
</p>

<p>
The JMS Specification, on the other hand, does not mention replication --
it's the responsibility of the product vendor to provide the necessary 
infrastructure. The maintainers of the 'classic' flavour of ActiveMQ 
made various attempts to integrate a native replication strategy, but
none proved to be robust. So installations that used this broker 
had to manage without
replication, or implement it at the filesystem level.
</p>

<p>
Replicating the disk filesystem that ActiveMQ uses for storing its
messages is a reasonable way of providing message continuity, but this
strategy merely pushes the problem from the brokers onto the
storage system. 
There are many replicated storage systems
on the market, but both flavours of ActiveMQ have exacting locking
requirements -- many network storage systems simply don't work properly
with these brokers.
</p>

<p>
Unlike its predecessor, ActiveMQ Artemis does have a native replication
system, as Kafka does, and it works quite well. 
It requires, however, a minimum cluster size of 
six brokers, to protect against
'split brain' situations if there is a network outage. In practice, I've 
found it easier to get a decent combination of robustness and
throughput using a good-quality replicated file store, than the
built-in replication machinery; but I'm aware of installations where
the built-in replication is working well.
</p>

<p>
While ActiveMQ installers usually have to pay
careful attention to the storage requirements imposed by the need
for replication, Kafka unequivocally
works best with simple, locally-connected disk storage. In fact, network
storage based on NFS V4, which is a common choice for ActiveMQ, works
poorly with Kafka. Block-type network storage works reasonably well
with Kafka, if you can keep the latency low enough, but it offers
no functional advantage over locally-connected disks.
</p>

<p>
In short, both ActiveMQ and Kafka offer fault tolerance with message
continuity. The complexity required to provide a robust
system is approximately the same for both systems. However, Kafka's
replication system is an integral part of the software, so administrators
usually don't have a complicated decision-making process to follow.
</p>

<h2>Message throughput</h2>
<p>
High throughput has always been one of Kafka's main selling points.
When properly installed and configured, Kafka can provide hugely increased 
throughput over any JMS-compliant broker, on equivalent hardware. 
</p>
<p>
However, this improvement is not invariable or automatic -- 
I've seen Kafka installations
that completely fail to exploit its inherent speed advantages. 
Usually this happens because the administrators have used
inappropriate storage, or have chosen overly-rigorous synchronization
requirements. Or, in some cases, the developer's ability to exercise
control over message routing has not be exploited properly -- more
on this subtlety later.
</p>

<h2>Messaging models</h2>
<p>
JMS-compliant message brokers must support a first-in, first-out ('queue') 
and a publish-subscribe ('topic') messaging model. Topic subscribers can be
ephemeral or durable; that is, they can ask for messages to be discarded 
or retained when they are not connected. JMS 2.0 introduces some refinements
to this model: in particular, durable subscriptions can now be exclusive
or shared. 
</p>

<p>
Kafka, by contrast, offers only a 'topic' messaging model, which is
inherently shared and durable. In fact, JMS messaging model concepts
don't
really map all that well to Kafka, because of its notion of
message retention -- a point I'll return to later. 
</p>

<p>
Another striking difference between the JMS messaging model and Kafka
is that Kafka imposes a key-value structure on each message. Both the key
and value are just bytes, and can be formatted as the developer wishes.
However, the key is not arbitrary -- messages with the same key are
routed preferentially to the same broker. So while, as a matter of
plain logic, we can just set all the key values to 'empty', doing
so might affect message throughput. 
</p>

<p>
It's perfectly possible to store a key-value combination in a JMS
message, but the key would be considered part of the payload, not part
of the routing logic. There isn't any way with JMS to control how
messages are routed in a multi-broker installation. Of course, the brokers
will try to be intelligent about this, but they are unlikely to be
as intelligent as a human designer working in ideal conditions. These
ideal conditions include being able to exploit Kafka's key-value
routing to advantage, which is not practicable in every application.
If the developer does not handle key-based routing properly, it can
lead to repeated <i>rebalancing</i> of the Kafka cluster, which is
inefficient.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the key-value routing machinery, 
JMS brokers offer hugely more complex and
powerful message distribution models that Kafka does. Part of the 
speed of Kafka, however, comes from its very simplicity.
</p>

<h2>Message retention</h2>
<p>
JMS brokers generally store messages until
they have been consumed by every consumer that has an interest. After that,
they are deleted. 
</p>

<p>
In practice, the implementation is usually not like this. ActiveMQ uses
a journalling message store, that records every messaging interaction
between clients and brokers. These interactions remain in the broker's
filesystem until entire journal files can be tidied up. This typically
happens when every messaging interaction in a specific journal file, 
for every client,
is completed. Still, from a JMS developer's perspective, a message has
to be considered gone once it has been consumed.
</p>

<p>
Kafka also uses a journalling filesystem, but it exposes it
to developers. 
The broker has a specific <i>retention time</i>, and messages live in
the journal until that time is exceeded. After that point, the messages
are removed, whether they have been read or not. Indefinite storage --
intentional or accidental -- is
not a feature of Kafka.
</p>

<p>
So that Kafka can give consumers the illusion that messages are removed
after consumption, 
each consumer
(actually each consumer group) in a Kafka installation has an <i>offset</i>.
The offset is the position in the journal which that consumer has read
up to. The offsets are stored within the Kafka broker itself, using the same
machinery that it uses to store message payloads. 
</p>

<p>
Unlike JMS clients, however, Kafka clients can control their 
reading positions in the journal.
There's nothing to stop a client reading the same message multiple times,
if it wishes. Sometimes the ability to do this is an advantage to the 
developer.
</p>

<p>
Because consumption does not trigger message deletion, making good 
use of storage in Kafka requires being able to judge a suitable
retention policy. This policy will depend on the message 
throughput and size and, of course,
the amount of storage available. My experience is that Kafka does not
behave very well if it runs out of storage. To be fair, no message broker
does, but Kafka seems particular prone to getting in a mess. Usually
we have to overestimate the storage requirements, because running out is
so destructive.
</p>

<p>
But JMS message brokers also have a retention problem -- it's just not
so visible to administrators. In ActiveMQ, the way that
journals are chained together means that an incomplete messaging operation
in one journal file can prevent a whole chain of files being tidied up.
It's not at all unusual for ActiveMQ to use ten times more storage than
the sum total of message payloads would suggest.
</p>

<h2>Wire protocols</h2>
<p>
The JMS Specification has nothing to say about the way that message data
is transmitted over a network. Vendors can choose the protocols they use.
In practice, modern JMS brokers support multiple protocols; common
choices are AMQP, STOMP, and MQTT. Both ActiveMQ 'classic' and Artemis
have their own native protocols as well.
</p>
<p>
Clients of JMS brokers potentially have access to different client libraries
to support these protocols. There are implementations of AMQP, for example, in
Java, C++, C#, Python, and probably others. In fact, there are multiple
implementations specifically for Java and C++. 
</p>
<p>
Kafka, on the other hand, supports only one wire protocol -- its own. 
There is an official Java client for Kafka's native protocol, and 
unofficial clients for
other languages. In the earlier days of Kafka, the wire protocol changed in
ways that were not backwards compatible; this was inconvenient for integrators,
because clients would have to be rebuilt and retested with each Kafka 
upgrade. However, the Kafka protocol has not changed significantly for
several years, and we now rarely encounter such problems.
</p>
<p>
Because of Kafka's popularity, other messaging products have started to support
the Kafka messaging protocol, even when they do not use Kafka internally.
Microsoft's Azure Event Bus is an example: this service is somewhat
inter-operable with Kafka, such that the same clients can use both, to
some extent.
</p>
<p>
It's also possible, with the appropriate libraries, to make JMS client
code work with Kafka, and Kafka clients to work with a JMS broker.
However, as I hope is now clear, Kafka and JMS are so different that
these intra-operability strategies are rarely very successful.
</p>

<h2>Message handling capabilities</h2>
<p>
As I've said, Kafka's messaging model is logically similar to 
a JMS shared durable 
subscription. This simple messaging model is accompanied by a correspondingly
simple client interface: if a subscriber has messages available to
it on a particular topic, at the offset stored, the subscriber
will get the message. And that's it. 
</p>

<p>
JMS, however, allows clients much more control over how (and whether)
messages get passed from producer to consumer. For example, a client
is able to specify an expiry time, after which the message will not be
delivered at all. Consumers can use selectors to receive messages based
on particular expressions. Producers can control how messages are 
grouped, such that they are received in a particular order.
</p>

<p>
Some JMS message brokers provide much more complex message handling.
ActiveMQ ('classic') for example allows Apache Camel rules to be installed
directly in the broker's JVM, to create very sophisticated routing
policies. This is, perhaps, a case of giving the developer too much
rope; it's not by accident that this feature isn't present in the 
Artemis release. Nevertheless, both ActiveMQ flavours allow the developer
to control message routing in ways that would be completely impossible
with Kafka alone.
</p>

<p>
In fact, a full list of things that JMS message brokers can do, that Kafka
can't, would be longer than the whole of this article. For better or
worse, Kafka is designed for speed, rather than versatility. You
<i>can</i> implement complex message routing and processing using Kafka,
but not with Kafka alone. You'd have to combine it with some 
external application code, perhaps based on Apache Camel.  
</p>

<p>
My conversations with Kafka maintainers have confirmed that there are no
plans to make Kafka more like a JMS broker, but offering a more versatile
client API. The speed of Kafka largely
follows from the fact that it <i>doesn't</i> have to do everything that
a JMS broker is obliged to do.
</p>

<h2>Containerization</h2>
<p>
Container-based deployment was already well established
by the time that Kafka became popular. Strimzi in an implementation of
Kafka for Kubernetes; it provides an operator that can deploy all the
infrastructure for a typical Kafka install in almost a one-click
operation. Of course, the installation can -- and nearly always should
-- be tuned; but Kafka's configuration and deployment model lends itself
nicely to containers. 
</p>
<p>
This doesn't mean that Kafka is easy to deploy and maintain on Kubernetes; a 
production-quality installation isn't 'easy' anywhere. But container operation
appears not to be an afterthought with Kafka.
</p>
<p>
Both flavours of ActiveMQ pre-date containers. Neither has a deployment or
configuration model which is well-suited to containerization. That's not
a fault, really: as a JMS broker, ActiveMQ is much more configuration
than Kafka, and supports many more deployment and storage models.
For example, Artemis supports the use of a relational database for the message
store. Using a database means that we need a way to provide database-specific configuration in the container, but it also requires a way to 
integrate the database driver into the
container, and such drivers are usually proprietary. Kafka has no such
problems, because it does not have this flexibility in its storage. 
Work is underway to make Artemis play more nicely with Kubernetes, but
it's going to take time. 
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Both Kafka and ActiveMQ can be used to implement interprocess messaging systems
that are robust and fast. It's arguably easier to get optimal throughput
with Kafka than any JMS-compliant broker; but careless design can easily
rob Kafka of its inherent advantages in this area.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Kafka is optimized for simple point-to-point raw
message delivery. Its speed advantage largely follows from the simplicity
of its distribution model. All JMS-based brokers have greater flexibility
in client-broker interaction than Kafka does, or is ever likely to.
