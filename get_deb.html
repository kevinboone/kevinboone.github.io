<h1>Extracting software from the Raspbian repository, for assembling a custom Linux image for the Raspberry Pi</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/pi.png" 
  alt="Pi logo"/>
Most of the Raspberry Pi-based equipment I build uses a custom
Linux installation -- all the official Linux distributions are
far too desktop-focused for an appliance. I explain in my article
on <a href="pi_boot_shell.html">booting a Raspberry Pi to a shell</a>
how to begin the process of assembling a custom Linux using
the official Raspian Linux kernel, which seems to me to 
be a reasonable approach
unless you're looking for sub-second boot times. I think also that,
when it comes to general-purpose utilities (<code>grep</code>, <code>cp</code>,
<code>sshd</code>, etc), there's something to be said for using
pre-built versions of these things, rather than compiling them
all from scratch. After all, the problem with Raspbian is not the 
software itself, but the way it is assembled into a full distribution.
</p>
<p>
It's perfectly possible to pick individual packages out of the 
repository, and unpack them to get the necessary files. In some cases
there may be no alternative. In most cases, though, it's easier if
you can set things up so you can just download a package, 
and all its dependencies, and have
the contents unpacked into a staging directory, ready to include in
your build. To be fair, there is a certain amount of 'dependency sprawl'
in the Raspbian (and most other) repositories, so you do have 
to exercise a bit of caution, and probably script some post-download pruning.
</p>
<p>
If you're running a Debian-based Linux, or even Raspbian itself,
then you can use the <code>apt-get</code> utility to fetch
files from the repository appropriate for your distribution. However,
this is probably not a good way to try to assemble your own Linux
distribution, for a number of reasons.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The platform you're working on may not even have <code>apt-get</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if it does, it will be configured to use repositories appropriate for the build platform, not the target platform.</p></li>
<li><p><code>apt-get</code> is part of a package manager, not just a downloader. It's awkward to separate it from the build platform's package database.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
In my view it's better, and not all that difficult, to script the 
download of files from a specified repository for a specified
target architecture and a specified version, rather than to try to
subvert existing tools to do the job (even if they are available).
</p>

<h2>How a Debian-based repository is organized</h2>

<p>
Like other Debian-based Linux distributions, Raspbian versions are
identified by name, rather than by number. At the time of writing,
the latest version is 'Buster'. The main Raspian repository
is at <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/">http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/</a>. Within that directory, the actual
packages -- for all platforms and architectures -- are in  
<a target="_blank" href="http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/pool/main">http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/pool/main</a>. The <code>pool/main/</code>
directory is organized into (approximate) alpha-numeric order by package
name but, with all the architectures and versions jumbled together,
it's difficult to locate the required package. 
</p>
<p>
To find the specific download you need for a particular Raspbian
version, you need to look in the package index which, for Buster
on ARM, is the file <code>Packages</code> in 
<a target="_blank" href="http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/dists/buster/main/binary-armhf/">dists/buster/main/binary-armhf</a>. There are
compressed and uncompressed versions, both of which are substantial,
and probably only need to be downloaded once in the life of a project.
</p>

<h2>Structure of the Packages file</h2>

<p>
The <code>Packages</code> file is a plain text file consisting of 
blocks of lines, one block per package, separated by blank lines.
In a script, you can easily find the block corresponding to a 
particular package by searching for a line of the form
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
Package: {name}
</pre>

<p>
and reading to the next blank line.
</p>

<p>
Each block consists of name-value pairs. For illustration, here is the
entry for the <code>findutils</code> package.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">

Description: utilities for finding files--find, xargs
 GNU findutils provides utilities to find files meeting specified
 criteria and perform various actions on the files which are found.
 This package contains 'find' and 'xargs'; however, 'locate' has
 been split off into a separate package.
</pre>

<p>
For our purposes, the relevant entries are <code>Depends</code> and
<code>Pre-Depends</code> -- which amount to the same thing here,
and <code>Filename</code>. These are the dependencies, and the
location of the <code>.deb</code> file that contains the code.
</p>

<p>
Even this simple example does illustrate a potential problem with using 
a repository for the purposes of building a custom Linux. <code>find</code>
has a dependency on <code>libc</code>, which is unproblematic -- 
almost everything does. It also has a dependency on <code>libselinux1</code>,
which may or may not be relevant. If you're building an appliance with an
embedded Linux system, you may have no need for SELinux. However, 
<code>find</code> won't work without the <code>libselinux.so</code> 
library, whether you're using SELinux or not. There's no easy way to
break that dependency other than to build <code>find</code> yourself
from source, with SELinux support disabled. If you download the 
<code>libselinux1</code> package -- and you'll have to, if you're
using repository builds</code> -- you'll find it has a dependency
on <code>libpcre3</code> which has a dependency on... and so it goes.
</p>

<p>
In short, working with a repository is much quicker than building
everything from source, but it's difficult to avoid including a heap
of software that you might not ever need, and which is not optimized
for embedded use. What you gain on the swings... etc.
</p>

<p>
In brief, to download <code>findutils</code>, you'll need to 
download it's <code>.deb</code> package, and then you'll have to
follow all its dependencies recursively, downloading all the 
packages that are referenced. If you're scripting the process, you'll
need to keep track of what you've downloaded, not just to avoid downloading
common dependencies over and over again, but to avoid the inevitable
'dependency loops' that the repository has. The packages themselves are located
by the <code>Filename:</code> line in each package block, and this
is relative to the top of the repository.
</p>

<h2>Structure of a .deb file</h2>
 
<p>
The <code>.deb</code> package file is just an <code>ar</code>
archive, and you can use <code>ar x</code> to unpack it.
Inside the archive are further compressed archives, of which the
only one relevant here is <code>data.xxx</code>. This file will be in
one of any number of compression formats so, if you're scripting the 
download, you need to be prepared to examine the file extension
and use the appropriate decompresser. 
</p>
<p>
The contents of the <code>data.xxx</code> are the actual files,
relative to the root directory of the installation. You can unpack
this file into whichever directory you are using to stage your root
filesystem.
</p>
<p>
Many packages contain post-installation scripts and, while these
might be appropriate if you're installing a package on a running
Linux system, they will be of little use in a custom build. In practice,
you'll need to script these post-installation steps, if there are any,
manually.
</p>


<h2>An implementation</h2>

A simple Perl script that does all the above, may be found on
<a target="_blank"  href="https://github.com/kevinboone/get_deb.pl">GitHub</a>.
By all means use it, but check it for suitability first.


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
Building the root filesystem of a custom Linux using a repository is
not difficult, and it's more convenient than building everything
from source. However, the files you get may not be optimal for an
embedded installation, and you'll almost certainly get a lot more
files than you ideally want. There's more to installing software than
simply copying files into the proper locations, and using a repository
won't relieve you of the need to do the post-installation work,
whatever it turns out to be.
</p>

<p>
One final note: there is software in the Raspbian repository that is
not, or is no longer, used by the mainstream distribution. There is
an implementation of SysV <code>init</code>, for example, which might
be more appropriate in an embedded Linux than <code>systemd</code>
would be.
