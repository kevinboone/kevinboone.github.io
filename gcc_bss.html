<h1>Why 'int x = 0' is uninitialized data to the GNU C compiler</h1>

<p>

</p>
<p>
This article is about a curiosity of <code>gcc</code> that will 
interest almost nobody. 
I came across it whilst implementing a program loader that could 
<a href="pico_run_ram.html">load binary code into RAM on a Raspberry Pi Pico</a>. I suspect that this is the only application where the initialization
behaviour of the C compiler is of any significance whatsoever, 
Still, I thought it worth writing up because, apart from anything else, it's
such bizarre behaviour that I can imagine myself being caught by it
again later, when my own intracranial RAM needs to be refreshed. 
</p>
<p>
I noticed the problem when different (global) variables in my programs,
although of the same type, were being treated differently at
runtime. For example,
I had variables defined like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#009900">int</font> max_columns<font color="#990000">=</font><font color="#993399">80</font><font color="#990000">;</font>
<font color="#009900">int</font> starting_column<font color="#990000">=</font><font color="#993399">0</font><font color="#990000">;</font>
</pre>

<p>
I couldn't work out why <code>max_columns</code> seemed to take the 
correct value, 80, but <code>starting_colums</code> had a crazy
value.
</p>
<p>
Now, I'm writing the program loader myself so, of course, I could well
understand why <i>all</i> the global variables would end up with
crazy values. It would just be a bug in my loader. 
I could even understand why variables of a particular
type or storage class might have ended up with crazy values. 
However, after much experimentation
I realized that the crazy values were all assigned to variables 
which were initialized to zero in my code. It turned out I could set any
value <i>except</i> zero. 
</p>
<p>
Let's look at a simple example to see why this happens. Although I'm
working on an embedded device, the problem can be seen quite easily using
the ordinary Linux <code>gcc</code>. 
</p>
<p>
Compile and link this trivial program:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#009900">int</font> aa1 <font color="#990000">=</font> <font color="#993399">42</font><font color="#990000">;</font>
<font color="#009900">int</font> aa2 <font color="#990000">=</font> <font color="#993399">6</font><font color="#990000">;</font>
<font color="#009900">int</font> aa3 <font color="#990000">=</font> <font color="#993399">0</font><font color="#990000">;</font>
<font color="#009900">int</font> aa4<font color="#990000">;</font>
<font color="#009900">int</font> <b><font color="#000000">main</font></b><font color="#990000">()</font> <font color="#FF0000">{</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">return</font></b> <font color="#993399">0</font><font color="#990000">;</font> <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
</pre>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ gcc -o test test.c
</pre>

<p>
I've chosen these "aa" names just to make it easy to find the variables
in the ELF file created by <code>gcc</code>:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ objdump --all test | grep aa 
</pre>

<p>
The output, on my system, is:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
000000000040401c g     O .data	0000000000000004              aa1
0000000000404020 g     O .data	0000000000000004              aa2
0000000000404028 g     O .bss	0000000000000004              aa3
000000000040402c g     O .bss	0000000000000004              aa4
</pre>

<p>
Notice that <code>aa1</code> and <code>aa2</code> -- variables that
are assigned non-zero values in my program -- are in <code>.data</code>
segments. But <code>aa3</code>, which is assigned the value 0, and
<code>aa4</code>, which is not assigned a value at all, are in
<code>.bss</code> segments. 
</p>
<p>
The problem was that my program loader was not initializing the BSS segments
correctly. So variables whose values were stored in those segments were
not getting zeroed. Since <code>aa3</code> specifically <i>had</i> to be
zero, not zeroing it was a significant error. 
</p>
<p>
But why are different variables of the same type in different segments?
What's so special about the value zero?
The fact is that I don't really know. I presume that this is some kind
of optimization carried out by <code>gcc</code>, in an attempt to be
save a few bytes somewhere.
</p>
<p>
Conventionally, 'data' segments are used to store values that have been
initialized specifically by the programmer. It matters what the values
are, and they are stored in the executable file generated by the compiler.
</p>
<p>
'BSS' segments, however, are traditionally used to "store" variables that
have not explicitly been given an initial value. "Store" isn't really
the right word here: the linker does not 
have to allocate any
space in the executable file for values of these
variables -- they are just placeholders.
</p>
<p>
Although no values are stored in the executable,
values still have to be set in memory. 
The C language standards,
however, stipulate that uninitialized global variables take the
value zero at runtime. So <i>somebody</i> has to initialize them. 
Setting these values to zero is not the responsibility of
the compiler -- at least, it is not in the GCC world. Instead, some
start-up code, executed before <code>main()</code> is invoked, has
to zero all this data.  
</p>
<p>
I can only imagine that <code>gcc</code> assumes that, if the programmer
sets a global variable to zero, it doesn't actually <code>need</code>
to store the zero value in the executable. If it assigns it to a 
BSS segment, the start-up code will zero it along with all the other
BSS data. And, frankly, neither the program nor the programmer usually
care about the exact addresses in memory where data is stored. So this
slightly odd behaviour potentially results in a modest saving
of executable size, at least if large numbers of variables
are involved.
</p>
<p>
It isn't an accident that <code>gcc</code> behaves this way. It turns out
that, on some platforms, <code>gcc</code> has a specific switch to 
control this behaviour: <code>-fzero-initialized-in-bss</code>.
</p>
<p>
As I said, this is an oddity that will affect almost nobody. The
default behaviour seems, well, wrong to me; but, unless you're implementing
a program loader, you probably won't even notice.
