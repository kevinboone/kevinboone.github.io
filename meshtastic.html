<h1 id="some-thoughts-on-lora-based-mesh-radio-technologies">Some
thoughts on LoRa-based mesh radio technologies</h1>
<p><img src="img/antenna.png" class="article-top-image" /> I have two
reasons for being interested in off-grid communication. First, I spend a
fair amount of time in areas that our mainstream communications
infrastructure just doesn’t reach. In the UK, you don’t have to be very
far from a population centre, before you find that there’s no mobile
phone signal. That’s the pragmatic reason for my interest.</p>
<p>A less pragmatic, more nebulous reason stems from the fact that our
communications infrastructure is fragile. I live in a densely-populated
urban area, and yet a single flash flood has rendered me effectively
off-grid, by cutting off a critical electricity supply. The roll-out of
‘fibre to the premises’ technology has made the situation even worse,
because it relies on the integrity of power supplies not just in one
location, but in multiple locations. It would be nice if at least
essential services could continue to function with a degraded
infrastructure. Perhaps we need to develop robust, decentralized,
battery-powered communications systems, and that’s what mesh radio
claims to offer.</p>
<p>In the UK, there are at present two popular mesh radio technologies:
<a href="https://meshtastic.org/">Meshtastic</a> and <a
href="https://meshcore.co.uk/">MeshCore</a>. I’ve tried both of these,
and I’ll be describing my experiences. I’ll also be comparing them to
widely-used analog radio technologies, like VHF and PMR.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-this-lora-thing-anyway">What is this LoRa thing,
anyway?</h2>
<p>LoRa (“LOng RAnge”) is a digital radio technology, optimized for
sending occasional, small‑ish packets of data, using low-power
transmitters. In the UK, LoRa devices transmit at less than 500mW in the
868MHz band – this power is referred to as “27 dBm” in LoRa jargon.
Despite the low power, LoRa can achieve a range of about a mile in urban
areas, and perhaps ten miles outdoors. However, the high‑ish frequencies
mean that LoRa’s transmissions are not really subject to reflections,
limiting its range to the visible horizon, regardless of power. Unlike
short-wave radio, which can bounce its way from one continent to
another, LoRa is usually a line-of-sight technology.</p>
<p>To achieve comparatively long distances with low average powers we
must accept the inevitable downside of low bandwidth – perhaps as little
as a few hundred bits per second. In addition, as any devices may
potentially be operating in the same narrow band, contention may limit
the bandwidth even further. LoRa is good for wide-area telemetry, like
“smart” utility meters: an electricity meter might need to send only a
few bytes each day.</p>
<p>For person-to-person communication, however, the low bandwidth means
that LoRa is mostly only useful for short text messages, and this kind
of messaging is exactly what technologies like Meshtastic and Meshcore
focus on.</p>
<p>Both these technologies and others, similar ones work by forming a
virtual mesh of radio nodes, within which the nodes relay messages from
one to another. The mesh topology makes it possible, in principle, to
achieve better than line-of-sight communication, even at low power. All
the popular mesh radio technologies allow (in some cases, mandate)
messages to be encrypted – an increasingly relevant security
measure.</p>
<p>The frequencies used by LoRa in the UK are licence-free. If you have
an amateur radio licence you can, in theory, use the LoRa frequencies at
higher powers but, in practice, none of the widely-available radio
devices can actually transmit at powers that need a licence. Also, as
it’s unlawful to encrypt communication when operating under an amateur
radio licence, licensed and non-licensed installations don’t play well
together, even when using the same core protocols.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-get-started-in-mesh-radio">What you need to get
started in mesh radio</h2>
<p>To use Meshtastic, Meshcore, or similar technologies, you’ll need at
least one each of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A microcontroller with built-in LoRa radio, like the <a
href="https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32-v3/">Heltec LoRa 32
v3</a>.</li>
<li>An antenna suitable for the frequency band. It need not be
large.</li>
<li>Something to provide a user interface to the microcontroller, such
as a smartphone or computer.</li>
<li>Software for the microcontroller and the user interface device.</li>
<li>A battery, if you need free-standing, off-grid operation. A single
18650 is a popular choice here.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Heltec LoRa device, like most similar parts, is just a tiny
PCB:</p>
<p><img src="img/heltec.png" class="article-centre-image" /></p>
<p>At the far right of the board, in the photo above, you can see the
IPEX antenna connector. IPEX is a tiny coaxial connector that I haven’t
seen used outside of LoRa applications. On the right is the USB power
and data connector, along with a couple of LEDs and pushbuttons. A small
screen can be programmed to provide status information, but this will
probably be powered down most of the time, to save energy. The little
copper coil next to the USB socket is the Bluetooth antenna.</p>
<p>A common set-up is to build all these components, except the user
interface, into a small case. Such cases are inexpensive and widely
available, as are plans to make them using a 3D printer. Alternatively,
you could buy a ready-made mesh radio like this <a
href="https://www.layerfab.com/products/meshtastic-terranode-in-11849"><em>TerraNode</em></a>,
made by LayerFab in the UK:</p>
<p><img src="img/terranode.jpg" class="article-centre-image" /></p>
<p>Although you’d probably use this device with a smartphone as the user
interface, it’s important to understand that the smartphone is
<em>only</em> the user interface – mesh radio doesn’t depend on any
public infrastructure.</p>
<p>The TerraNode uses a Heltec LoRa radio board, which comes
pre-programmed with the Meshtastic firmware. All you need to do to get
started is to pair it with a smartphone using Bluetooth. Supplying the
unit pre-programmed makes it easier for new users to get started, but
the supplied Meshtastic firmware could be a little out-of-date. In that
case, you’ll need to install new firmware yourself. You could also just
change the firmware for Meshcore or something else. More on the subject
of firmware later.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you don’t want to use a phone at all, even as a
user interface, you could use a completely self-contained LoRa device
like the <a href="https://lilygo.cc/products/t-deck">T-Deck</a> which
has its own keyboard and screen:</p>
<p><img src="img/t-deck.jpg" class="article-centre-image" /></p>
<p>The combination of a microcontroller, radio, power supply, and
antenna makes a <em>mesh node</em>, of which there are various
functional types, that is, different roles they can play in the
mesh.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-mesh-works">How the mesh works</h2>
<p>Although there are now a number of competing mesh radio technologies,
they all work in broadly the same way.</p>
<p>The mesh is made of communicating nodes. Some or all of these nodes
are relays (or repeaters, or routers – different words for the same
thing), which can pass messages from one node to another. Others are
non-relay (‘mute’) clients, that can send and receive messages, but do
not distribute them.</p>
<p>If a client can’t reach another client directly, it can ask a relay
to pass the message along. It’s important to understand that relaying
messages around a dynamically-changing network is a Hard Problem, with
no optimal solution. It is the different relaying behaviour that largely
distinguishes the different mesh radio technologies.</p>
<p>For example, in the Meshtastic system, the standard behaviour of
relay nodes is to ‘flood’. That is, when a node receives a packet that
is not addressed to itself, it forwards it to every other node it knows
about (I’m oversimplifying here – later versions allow for more
controlled flooding).</p>
<p>The use of flooding makes the mesh robust, at the expense of
potentially high levels of traffic. Without some way to restrict
traffic, it will tend to grow exponentially with the number of
nodes.</p>
<p>Meshcore supports flooding, but it also allows for nodes to learn
specific routes from one node to another. Because nodes tend to be
ephemeral, Meshcore has to fall back on flooding from time to time, but
the hope is that its more sophisticated routing reduces the amount of
traffic in the mesh.</p>
<p>Meshcore also allows the operator to define a manual route from one
client to another, which could be useful if the operator knows something
about the topology that cannot be discovered automatically.</p>
<h2 id="mesh-radio-firmware">Mesh radio firmware</h2>
<p>So far as I can see, the various mesh radio technologies support
broadly the same hardware. So whether you’re using the Meshtastic or
Meshcore system, or something else, depends on the firmware you install
(‘flash’) on the microcontroller. It’s worth bearing in mind that, at
this time, <em>none</em> of these technologies are interoperable –
you’re making a one-time decision which network to join when you flash
the firmware.</p>
<p>In most (all?) cases, you’ll perform the initial firmware
installation using a computer and a USB cable. Both Meshtastic and
Meshcore have web-based flashing systems, although both support only
Chromium-based web browsers. I could not get Meshtastic’s web flasher to
work on my Linux laptop, but Meshtastic also supplies a command-line
Python program, which worked fine. This would be my preferred way to
work, anyway; but I’m funny like that. Meshcore’s web-based flasher
worked fine for me, which is good because, as far as I know, Meshcore
documents no other way of installing firmware.</p>
<p>Both Meshcore and Meshtastic provide different kinds of firmware for
each supported LoRa device. Some firmwares have Bluetooth support, for
example, which is useful if you’re using a smartphone as the user
interface. Meshcore describes this kind of firmware as “companion”
firmware, which seems to me a rather odd term. Meshcore also requires
the user to select a specific firmware for a particular mode of
operation – we have to select between a relay (repeater, in Meshcore
terminology) or mute client at installation time, for example.
Meshtastic allows the user to set these roles at runtime.</p>
<p>Whatever firmware you use, you’ll need to set the operating frequency
directly after flashing – until you do this, you could be operating
unlawfully, and you won’t see any other nodes. Once paired, you can use
the smartphone app to perform this configuration, and change many other
settings. Alternatively, there are command-line clients for nerds like
me, which can work over a USB connection if you don’t want to use
Bluetooth.</p>
<h2 id="installing-a-user-interface-app-on-a-smartphone">Installing a
user-interface app on a smartphone</h2>
<p>Both Meshcore and Meshtastic support Bluetooth communication to a
smartphone, which is likely to be more convenient than a serial
connection for a portable node. Both also support USB communication,
though, which might be better for a permanently-installed relay
node.</p>
<p>I was pleased to find that both Meshcore and Meshtastic provide
Android APK files for their smartphone software, rather than forcing
users to go to an app store. That’s a big deal for me, as my Android
phones are completely de-Googled, and I can’t use the Google Play Store.
Meshtastic is on the Play Store, but it’s also on F-Droid, which is a
non-Google app store for open-source software.</p>
<p>It’s worth bearing in mind that the Meshtastic phone app is
open-source, which is why it’s available on F-Droid. The Meshcore app is
free, but it’s not open-source. In addition, some features can only be
enabled by payment. I do not know if these features would work on a
de-Googled phone although, of course, this won’t be an issue for most
users.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, I found Meshtastic’s Android app to be both
more useable and more stable than Meshcore’s. However, both are
undergoing rapid development. There are apps for Apple phones, but I
don’t know anything about them.</p>
<h2 id="antenna-issues">Antenna issues</h2>
<p>The maxim “height is might” is truer for LoRa than for many other
radio technologies, because it tries to achieve long range with
comparatively high frequencies, which resist reflection. We don’t
usually care how high we mount our WiFi antennas, because we don’t
expect them to cover more than a single building.</p>
<p>LoRa antennas may be <em>omnidirectional</em> or
<em>unidirectional</em>. A unidirectional antenna will focus the
transmitted power in a specific geographical direction, which is a
useful characteristic if you’re trying to create a fixed route between
two locations. For portable use, omnidirectional is almost always going
to be more useful.</p>
<p>LoRa also requires more attention to antenna <em>gain</em> than other
radio technologies. Broadly, a high-gain antenna will tend to
concentrate the transmitted power into a narrow vertical disk, whether
it’s omnidirectional or unidirectional. Such an antenna will create a
stronger signal at the receiver, so long as it hits the receiver at all.
A low-gain omnidirectional antenna will distribute power in what is
essentially a sphere. The transmitter can’t miss the receiver entirely,
but the received signal might be too weak to decode. In practice,
though, portable operation more-or-less requires low-gain,
omnidirectional antennas, because nodes will move around with their
users. LoRa devices are often supplied with an antenna suitable for
portable use – it will be a stub about two inches long.</p>
<p>As with other radio applications, it’s perfectly possible for a LoRa
node to see other nodes, but not be able to transmit to them. Since all
nodes are notionally transmitting at the same power, this discrepancy
can only be the result of antenna style and placement.</p>
<p>Real enthusiasts make their own antennas, which is relatively easy
with the high frequencies of LoRa. It’s certainly a whole lot easier
than making an antenna for the 3.5MHz short-wave band, which could fill
a field.</p>
<h2 id="mesh-radios-for-outdoor-activities">Mesh radios for outdoor
activities</h2>
<p>Broadly, they work fine. If you’re using a smartphone as the user
interface, you just leave the mesh node powered on, in your pocket or
backpack; Bluetooth provides communication between the radio and the
smartphone. There’s little need to refer to the tiny screen on the LoRa
device itself, if it even has one, because the smartphone app provides
the entire user interface. An 18650 battery will give the node about the
same battery life as a typical cellphone – one to two days with light
use.</p>
<p>For outdoor activities that have a permanent base camp, it’s typical
to dedicate a mesh node as a relay, and provide it with an antenna on a
pole (or up a tree). The relay behaviour of mesh radio means that two
users can communicate if they can both reach the base node, even if they
can’t reach one another directly.</p>
<p>How does LoRa compare with other, well-established technologies in
this area? I’ve used both VHF radios (operating at about 140MHz) and PMR
radios (466MHz) for outdoor activities. For VHF, we have the notorious
Baofeng UV-5R, which costs about £25. PMR radios can be had for half
this price – less, if you buy them in bulk. VHF radios typically require
a licence of some kind – either amateur or commercial; The PMR radio
band is licence-free.</p>
<p>VHF and PMR radios operate at much higher powers than LoRa, and don’t
really achieve better range. But – and this fact shouldn’t be
underestimated – these technologies support <em>speech</em>; LoRa will
only carry short text messages.</p>
<p>Like LoRa, VHF and PMR are line-of-sight radio technologies, but they
don’t have the relay features of mesh radio. Well – they kind of do:
it’s just that the relaying is manual. If Alice can reach Bob but not
Charles, she can ask Bob to pass the message to Charles. To be fair,
this kind of manual relay works best when there is a dedicated base
station that acts as a control point; it’s hit-and-miss otherwise.</p>
<p>I suspect, though, that the terrain features that interfere with VHF
and PMR will also interfere with LoRa <em>in practice</em> if not in
principle. LoRa nodes might coincidentally be placed to route around an
inconvenient mountain but, if they’re just in hikers’ pockets, they
might not be. I’m not sure I’d want to rely on mesh radio in difficult
terrain, unless there were a huge number of nodes, all evenly
distributed. Similarly, in the woods I might get only a (direct) range
of half a mile with PMR (less if it’s wet). But LoRa won’t do better
unless there’s a node every half mile or better.</p>
<p>It’s not even as if LoRa technology is cheaper than the traditional
alternatives, and it’s certainly no more convenient. In fact, being
limited to text messaging is a lot <em>less</em> convenient.</p>
<p>However, some outdoor events have an extended set-up period, and it
wouldn’t add significantly to this time, to deploy LoRa relay nodes at
strategic points around the area. It’s relatively easy to make LoRa
nodes solar-powered, so you wouldn’t necessarily have to
recharge/replace their batteries every day. I’ve also heard of people
attaching LoRa relay nodes to balloons, and floating them hundreds of
feet above the ground; this isn’t something that can usefully be done
with analog radio. If the relay nodes have store-and-forward
capabilities then, in principle, messages could be stored for client
nodes that are temporarily out of range. Again, analog radio can’t do
this.</p>
<p>In short, while I can see certain applications for mesh radio in
outdoor activities, it does not seem to offer an overwhelming advantage
over existing technologies, other than in a limited number of scenarios
that capitalize on mesh radio’s unique strengths.</p>
<h2 id="mesh-radio-for-civil-contingencies">Mesh radio for civil
contingencies</h2>
<p>We take it for granted that we can send a message to anybody,
more-or-less anywhere on Earth, in a fraction of a second; but a vast
assemblage of inter-dependent infrastructure makes this possible. A
natural disaster, even a localized one, can bring this this entire
system down, over a large area.</p>
<p>It’s not uncommon for the civil authorities to turn to amateur radio
operators to provide communications back-up in times like this.
Unfortunately, the number of traditional amateurs is decreasing, and
most likely will continue to decrease. By ‘traditional’ I mean
transmitting voice at tens of watts through vast antennas. But
LoRa-based hobbyist radio is growing in popularity, at least in some
parts of the world. So it’s reasonable to ask whether a hobbyist radio
mesh, or even a governmental one, could step up when the infrastructure
has fallen down.</p>
<p>On the face of it, it seems eminently possible. LoRa nodes are
inexpensive, and can be powered from, say, a USB power bank for many
days. They can even be solar-powered. Mesh radio is tolerant of node
outages, and adapts well to changes in topology. Its low bandwidth isn’t
a problem if all you need to communicate are the locations of evacuation
points or where to get emergency food supplies.</p>
<p>The problem lies in achieving the necessary critical mass of nodes.
Short-wave amateur radio has its problems, but it can cover reasonable
distances with no intermediate stations. Mesh radio, by its very nature,
needs a mesh to be effective. But how dense must the coverage be?</p>
<p>In urban areas, I think you’d need a relay node every half a mile or
so, as a minimum, for reliable coverage. I live in a densely-populated
area near to London; there are, at the time of writing, two Meshcore
relays I can reach at least sometimes, and no Meshtastic relays. I know
there are Meshtastic operators only a few miles from me, because I’ve
communicated with them in other ways; I guess the built-up nature of the
environment makes their relays inaccessible to me, even though I’m using
a high-gain antenna on a 30-foot mast. In the urban environment in which
I live, a mile seems to be about the absolute maximum range that LoRa
can reach, and even that won’t be entirely reliable.</p>
<p>LoRa itself isn’t really designed for general-purpose communication:
it’s designed for telemetry. The only reason for the number of mesh
radio nodes to grow is if more people are using them. And if more people
are using them, there will most likely be more traffic on the mesh.
Existing mesh radio protocols do not scale well to high traffic volumes
so, presumably, there’s a optimal node density that will give reasonable
coverage with manageable traffic – but we don’t know what that density
is yet. I’m fairly sure that, in the UK at least, we’re a long way from
reaching it.</p>
<p>This situation isn’t helped by the fact that there are multiple,
incompatible protocols. Each has its own user base, and the developers
do not seem particularly willing to collaborate. Meshtastic and Meshcore
are so similar that I can’t help wondering why they exist as separate
entities at all. And yet, after a lifetime of working with Linux, I’ve
become used to situations in which people who ought to be working
together are actually in competition.</p>
<p>In short, while LoRa mesh radio offers an unprecedented opportunity
to create a community-driven, robust emergency communications network, I
see little evidence so far of progress in that direction.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>LoRa-based mesh radio is an interesting, inexpensive technology that
provides text messaging without any additional infrastructure. The nodes
are light in weight, and can be powered by batteries or solar panels.
While its supporters promote it for outdoor activities like hiking and
hunting, I can think of few instances were it offers a truly compelling
advantage over, for example, PMR radio. That’s not to say there are
<em>no</em> applications, but I think they are likely to be
comparatively exotic.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as a radio enthusiast, I imagine I will continue to
experiment with it.</p>
