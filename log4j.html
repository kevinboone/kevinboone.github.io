<h1>Log4J -- ask yourself: do I really <i>need</i> that library?</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/java_logo.png" 
  alt="Java logo"/>
Few people who work in the middleware area of the computing
industry will have missed the ongoing Log4J debacle. For those who
did: Log4J is a Java logging library that was revealed to create a 
major security vulnerability in server systems. The vulnerability
wasn't easy to exploit, but there's little doubt that it <i>was</i>
exploited. Because the vulnerability allowed remote execution of
arbitrary code, it's plausible that systems have been compromised in
ways which will be difficult to fix.  
</p>
<p>
Ironically, while we usually advise system integrators to keep their
software components up to date, the most serious of the Log4J
defects only affected relatively recent versions. It's worth thinking
about why this is.
</p>
<p>
Log4J has suffered the "feature creep" that is
so common in general-purpose software libraries. A new feature
introduced into version 2 of Log4J --  a feature that hardly anybody will
use -- combined with pre-existing features in a dangerous way 
that the maintainers
of the library could hardly have predicted. It isn't difficult to
avoid the problem, simply by disabling the offending new feature; but
who knows what harm was done before this was realized?
</p>
<p>
What made the Log4J problem so devastating, and its aftermath so costly
to clean up,
is the ubiquity of this library -- almost every 
Java-based middleware platform uses it. After all, logging is a very
common requirement; almost every server-based application will
need a way to record structured logs. 
</p>

<p>
The problem here is not really a technical one -- it is a
combination of psychological and economic factors. The result
of these factors is that 
<i>we software developers have become lazy and complacent</i>.
</p>

<p>
I've used Log4J many times in my projects. To be honest, when it
came to logging, it hardly
occurred to me to do anything other than to throw an open-source
library at the problem. I was aware that Log4J was a much larger,
more complex piece of software than my application called for,
but that's not really a problem these days. 
</p>
<p>
Modern computers are so powerful that we no longer have to worry
much about efficiency. The core Log4J library contains about 2Mb 
of compiled code. Does it really take 2Mb just to write log messages?
It hardly seems credible. The reality is that most projects that use
Log4J use only a tiny part of its colossal feature set. Most
developers probably don't even <i>know</i> its whole feature set.
I certainly didn't, until I found myself involved in 
working around all its myriad security flaws.
</p>
<p>
In principle, using a library like Log4J, rather than writing new project-specific code, makes
good economic sense. Most immediately, every time I use it, it saves me 
the couple of days it would
take to code and test my own logging implementation. More subtly,
though, it <i>should</i> be the case that an open-source component
like this, that is very widely used, and completely open to 
scrutiny, should be reliable and safe. Experience showed us, however,
that this was not the case with Log4J v2.
</p>

<p>
Log4J shows us what happens when a library grows out of proportion
to its core functionality. The part of Log4J that most developers actually
use can be implemented in a couple of hundred lines of Java code. 
Any reasonably-experienced Java developer could write that code. 
Will it be perfect? Probably not; but it's a lot easier to make a 
couple of hundred lines of code close enough to perfect, than it
is to do the same thing with a hundred thousand lines of code.
</p>

<p>
The sad fact is that, while we all saved time and money in the short
term by using Log4J, that saving was almost certainly swallowed up
in the enormous cost of mitigating its security weakness, typically
in a state of screaming panic with entire installations shut down in fear.
</p>

<p>
That we have become so unconcerned about code efficiency is 
why I recommend that everybody who writes software should
spend some time
<a href="kcalc-cpm.html">developing for an 8-bit computer with 64kB or RAM</a>
 -- <a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/cpm-cal">ideally in assembly language</a>. If we all did that, we wouldn't take the power of modern
computers so much for granted. We might, perhaps, be a little less willing
to allow that power to lead us into complacent, dangerous ways of working. 
</p>

<p>
This isn't just about Log4J, of course. Most of the software I 
maintain is composed of hundreds or thousands of open-source libraries.
We use dependency-management tools so that the dependencies between
these libraries are resolved automatically, with the result that we
often don't even know what software we are using. We certainly don't 
know who wrote most of that software, or what nefarious intent 
one or more of the original developers may have had. Open source is
not a solution to that problem, when the libraries we are using
contain hundreds of thousands of lines of undocumented code.
</p>

<p>
The Log4J incident should be a wake-up call for the entire software
industry. It's an opportunity to re-evaluate our priorities, and
to consider whether short-term benefits outweigh long-term risks.
</p>

<p>
So: the next time you're writing software, think: do I really
<i>need</i> that library? Most importantly, is its size and complexity
appropriate for the way I intend to use it? Perhaps we all need to 
write a bit more original code, and rely less on libraries.
