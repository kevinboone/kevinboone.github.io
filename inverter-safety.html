<h1>Why your cheap mains inverter could kill you</h1>
<p>
<img src="img/plug.png" alt="plug symbol" class="article-top-image"/>
A mains inverter is a device that converts the DC power provided
by a battery (often as 12V car battery) to an AC mains supply. 
These devices can be very useful, and are generally safe if used
carefully and as designed. However, all inverters -- particularly
inexpensive ones -- create electric shock hazards that are not
obvious.  
These hazards are most troubling when the inverter is used in 
a way for which it was not really intended -- for example, 
in a permanent 
or semi-permanent installation, or in environmentally hostile conditions.
</p>
<p>
I see a lot of discussion of this topic on web forums, and it is 
usually ill-informed. In this article I will illustrate in detail
why the
shock hazards exist, and why the steps that are often recommended to
mitigate them will not work reliably.
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>In this article, I'm only discussing electric shock hazards. Careless use of inverters also creates an overheating and possibly a fire hazard. It's important to operate these devices within their design limits.</blockquote>

<h2>The problem with cheap inverters</h2>
<p>
Mains inverters with nominal power ratings of several kilowatts are
available for less than &pound;100. These inverters are invariably
"unisolated" (or "non-isolated"). 
This means
that there is a direct electrical connection between the 
battery side of the inverter, and the mains side. If you attach an
AC voltmeter between either of the battery pins, and either of the
live/neutral pins, you'll measure a voltage.
</p>
<p>
Depending on where you measure, and the design of the inverter,
this voltage will probably be in the range 60-200V -- at least, that's
what I've measured when I've tested these devices. You <i>might</i>
find that one of the input terminals is directly connected to 
one of the mains terminals -- the negative battery terminal to the 
neutral mains terminal,
for example. In that case, you'll read no voltage between negative and
neutral, and probably 200V between positive and live. 
</p>
<p>
It's also important to understand that, while a domestic mains
socket has live, neutral, and earth (or ground) 
pins, these designations are <i>meaningless</i> for an inverter.
The earth pin
on the mains outlet of a cheap inverter is probably not connected to anything.
The notion of "live" makes sense in a permanent electrical installation,
where  the neutral pin is at roughly the same potential as the Earth
(the lump of rock we're standing on). The "live" pin is live because 
its voltage is different from that of the Earth. In Europe we
call that difference "230 volts", but all that matters in this context
is that it's large enough to hurt. With an inverter, though, 
you can't read anything at all into which mains pin is "live" and which is
"neutral" -- they might as well be called "1" and "2". 
</p>
<p>
In summary, "unisolated" means that current can, and will, flow
between the mains terminals and the battery terminals of a cheap
 inverter. Why that's a big deal is something I will return to
shortly.
</p>
<p>
An "isolated" (or "galvanically isolated") inverter has a transformer
(magnetic) coupling between the battery side and mains side. 
This isolation solves some, but not all, the electrical safety 
problems I will describe in this article. 
</p>
<p>
How do you know whether the isolator you bought from eBay is 
is isolated or not? The glib answer is that if you can lift
it with one hand, it isn't isolated. Also, if you didn't have to
think very hard about the expenditure, it's probably not
isolated. An isolated inverter will cost 10-100 times the
price of an unisolated one. 
</p>
<p>
The better answer is that you'll have to ask the manufacturer --
advertisements often do not make it clear. I think that's because
professional-grade inverters, designed for permanent installation
by a specialist, are usually isolated, so this isn't stated. 
Cheap inverters are always unisolated, and this isn't stated either,
because it's not a selling point.
</p>
<p>
If there's any doubt, you should assume that your inverter is
unisolated, and use it accordingly.
</p>

<h2>How to use a cheap, unisolated inverter safely</h2>

<p>
The figure below shows the only way in which it is reasonably safe
to use an unisolated mains inverter. Here the battery and the
inverter are completely isolated from any kind of ground 
connection (by the rubber mats). The user can connect exactly 
one appliance, directly to the socket on the inverter.
Of course, nobody's going to use real rubber mats; but careful
operation (e.g., in completely dry conditions away from other
metallic objects) can approximate to such a configuration.
This set-up is often referred to as a "floating" supply,
meaning that the mains pins are not constrained to take up
any particular voltage with reference to earth -- there is 
no earth.
<p>
</p>

</p>

<figure style="margin: 1em; text-align: center">
 <img src="img/inverter1.png" width="650px" />
 <figcaption>
 <i>
The only safe way to use a cheap, unisolated mains inverter: 
if it's (kind of) safe to stick your finger in the plug, it's 
probably safe in most other fault conditions.
 </i>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Now, I've shown the user -- the blue fellow on the right -- sticking his
fingers directly into the socket, and nobody would be daft enough to
do that. The point I'm trying to make, however, is that this is a safe
configuration. It's unlikely that any other fault condition will expose
Bluey to a worse hazard than direct connection to the mains outlet;
if that's safe, everything else is probably safe.
</p>
<p>
Why is this safe? To get an electrical shock, an electric current has
to flow through the body. The body has to be part of an electric
circuit. In the configuration shown above, the physical separation between
the electrical equipment, and the ground, ensure that no such 
circuit can be formed. If Bluey sticks his finger in the socket,
what will actually happen is that his body will pull the mains
socket down to earth potential. The rest of the equipment, including
the battery, will take on some voltage relative to that. Still,
that won't affect Bluey (so long as he is the only person 
involved in the installation).
</p>

<h2>How to use an unisolated inverter unsafely</h2>

<p>
So that's the safest way to use a cheap inverter: no connection of any
kind to anything except a single electrical appliance -- a
fully-floating supply. So now let's
look at the <i>most</i> dangerous way to use such a device.
</p>

<figure style="margin: 1em; text-align: center">
 <img src="img/inverter2.png" width="650px" />
 <figcaption>
 <i>
The least safe way to use an unisolated inverter: with some
(any) part of the system deliberately earthed.
 </i>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
In this configuration, some part of the electrical installation is
deliberately earthed, perhaps using an earthing stake. The fact that the
earthing connection short-circuits the rubber mats should give us a 
clue that the arrangement is likely to be problematic.
</p>

<p>
Again, I've shown Bluey sticking his fingers into the mains socket,
which nobody would do. However, an electrical short-circuit inside
a metal device (an electric drill, for example), will have exactly 
the same effect -- the user will be left holding a "live" part.
</p>

<p>
Remember that "live" and "neutral" are dubious terms when using an
inverter. Both the "live" and "neutral" pins can potentially
carry a dangerous voltage in the "earthed" configuration, 
so it doesn't matter whether the
putative fault is on the live connection or the neutral.
</p>

<p>
By earthing the battery (or any other part of the system) we have
created exactly the electrical circuit that the rubber mats were
intended to prevent. Current can now flow from the mains socket,
through the body of Bluey, through the ground, and back to the
battery via the earth stake.
</p>

<p>
People do use their inverters like this, because they have some
notion that "earthing" is a good thing. You can even buy portable
earth stakes for exactly this purpose. The kind of danger that is
created by careless earthing depends on what, exactly, is earthed;
but it will never be a good practice with a cheap inverter.
</p>

<p>
How bad the danger is depends on the conditions. If Bluey
is wearing rubber boots, and standing on dry ground, he'll probably
get away with a tingle. If it's wet, and he's barefoot, 
he could be in trouble.
</p>

<p>
In practice, though, you don't need to drive an earth stake to
create an inadvertent path for fault current. Suppose the 
battery, or the inverter,
are standing on wet ground. In such a case, you don't even need the
earth stake -- you've directly earthed the equipment via the 
water.
</p>

<p>
Or consider the case where the battery is actually in a car -- this
is probably a very common application for a mains inverter. 
The car doesn't have rubber mats, but it does have rubber tyres.
These tyres isolate the inverter from the ground and are, in 
effect, safety features.
</p>

<p>
But suppose somebody is standing outside the car, and 
leaning on it. That person is creating an additional path
for fault current, bypassing the insulation of the rubber
tyres. This scenario is not as dangerous as deliberate earthing, 
but it's not entirely safe, either. When cars are provided with
built-in mains inverters, it's really only safe to use them
inside the vehicle. 
</p>

<p>
In short, real-world applications of mains inverters typically 
fall between the "best" and "worst" scenarios I've described
above. Nobody is going to stand their equipment on a rubber mat,
but the nearer we get to that configuration, the safer we will
be.
</p>

<h2>The dilemma of earth-neutral bonding</h2>

<p>
If earthing is so dangerous, why is it so ubiquitous in permanent
electrical installations? There are a number of reasons for this,
but we only need consider one of them here. If the electrical 
equipment has an earthed enclosure, then if a fault occurs
in the equipment, such that an electrical part short-circuits
to the enclosure, the resulting high fault current will blow
a fuse (or trip a breaker).  
</p>

<p>
You'll notice, perhaps, that none of the electrical faults I showed
above will generate enough current to trip a fuse. A few tens of 
milliamps flowing through the human body could be quite dangerous, but
we need amps to blow the fuse. 
</p>

<p>
It is for this reason, I think, that some people recommending bonding
the earth and neutral connections of an inverter. You'll need to
make a piece of equipment to do this, which should be a red flag
from the start; but it's common advice. Let's see why this might
be considered a safety feature.
</p>

<figure style="margin: 1em; text-align: center">
 <img src="img/inverter3.png" width="650px" />
 <figcaption>
 <i>
Making an earth-neutral bond in the inverter will allow an electrical
short circuit to blow a fuse and render the system safe. But 
it's not as sensible as it first seems.
 </i>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
In the diagram above, the inverter's neutral and earth are
connected together, and the mains socket is powering a piece of
equipment with a metal enclosure. The enclosure will be connected
to the earth of the mains plug (because this is necessary for safe
usage in a permanent electrical installation). The red line shows
the faulty short-circuit between the live input and the case.
</p>

<p>
The plug of the equipment has a fuse (and, if it doesn't, there 
will be a fuse or a breaker in the inverter itself). It should
be clear from the diagram that there is a low-resistance path
from the inverter's live to the inverter's neutral, sensible via the 
sensible case of the equipment. This will blow the fuse (or trip the 
breaker) and render everything safe -- sort of. At least it
will stop us using this faulty equipment until the defect
is repaired. 
</p>

<p>
This earth-neutral bond looks like a good idea at first sight; to
see why it might not be, we have to consider what happens in
the <i>no fault</i> scenario.
</p>

<p>
In the diagram below, there is no electrical fault in the
equipment, but somebody (who is standing on the ground) 
has hold of it. The equipment is, perhaps, a power tool, which
the user is likely to grip tightly. 
</p>

<figure style="margin: 1em; text-align: center">
 <img src="img/inverter4.png" width="650px" />
 <figcaption>
 <i>
In the no-fault condition, the earth-neutral bond creates
a path for fault current that is sufficient to cause a 
shock.
 </i>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Bluey on the left can blithely carry on using his
electric drill, until somebody else -- who is also
standing on the ground -- touches <i>any</i> other
part of the electrical system. Because the inverter
is unisolated, there is a path for current through
<i>both</i> the human bodies, via the Earth.
</p>

<p>
To be fair, this is probably a less likely fault scenario
than the one that arises if the equipment is operated in
damp conditions. But that fault scenario can be present
<i>as well</i>. 
</p>

<p>
In short, the earth-neutral bond replaces one danger
-- not detecting that there is a fault in an appliance --
with a different danger -- unexpected voltages raised
elsewhere in the system.
</p>

<h2>Earth-neutral bonding with an earth stake</h2>
<p>
Suppose we bond the earth and neutral (as above) and then connect
the combined earth and neutral to true earth, using an earth stake.
In this configuration the fellow on the right will be fine -- his
equipment enclosure will now be at earth potential, so he cannot
be shocked. But the person on the left will receive <i>double</i>
the voltage with respect to earth. So that's hardly an 
improvement in safety. 
</p>
<p>
In fact, the use of an earth stake means that the car battery is
live, with respect to earth, even if the person on the right is
not even present. The earth stake is creating the risk he previously
created -- a path to Earth for fault currents -- but much more
effectively. Not only is it not an improvement in safety, it's
potentially lethal.
</p>
<p>
The use of an earth stake might make RCD protection (see below)
more reliable, but it's still wrong.
</p>


<h2>A note on RCDs and similar safety devices</h2>
<p>
People often ask whether it's a good idea to use an earth-fault
detector like an RCD on the output of an inverter. If the
inverter system is fully floating, as in the first picture in this
article, then an RCD won't work, and will be unnecessary. In fact,
it won't work <i>because</i> it is unnecessary. Since there's no
path for fault currents, there's nothing to trip the RCD.
</p>

<p>
What about a situation where the supply is supposed to be floating,
but is inadvertently earthed by, for example, being run in the wet?
In such a situation an RCD <i>might</i> trip before somebody is
hurt -- it depends somewhat on the design of the device. In general,
RCDs sense an imbalance in current between the mains supply terminals;
if these currents are unequal, then some current is going somewhere
it should not. 
</p>

<p>
The problem is that RCDs are not really designed to work on 
floating supplies where, as I've said, they are unnecessary. A particular
device might work, but I'm not sure it should be relied on. In any
case, the "test" button on the RCD won't work, because there is no
path for the simulated fault current, and that alone makes the
set-up unsafe. 
</p>

<p>
What about the situation where the inverter's earth and neutral are
bonded? The RCD probably will detect the fault condition I showed
in the picture above, where the path for fault current is through
two people, one of whom is (for example) leaning on the body of a car
that is powering the inverter.
</p>

<p>
The RCD <i>might</i> trip in this situation although, again, this
 isn't an application for which it will have been designed. 
But that's not really
the point -- the bonded earth-neutral creates a shock risk 
<i>even in a no-fault situation</i>. It does not need any kind of
equipment failure 
 for there to be a hazard. 
Maybe, if we're lucky, the RCD will prevent
serious harm; but nobody ought to be exposed to an electric shock
from car bodywork, particularly in a no-fault situation. 
</p>

<h2>The problem of distribution</h2>

<p>
At the start of this article, I said that part of running an inverter
safely was to supply exactly one appliance. If the supply is
"floating", why does it matter how many appliances are connected?
</p>
<p>
Remember that the floating supply is safe so long as <i>nothing is earthed</i>.
Earthing any part of the system potentially creates a problem. The
more appliances are connected, and the more people who use them, the
more likely it is that the "no earth" rule will be compromised.
</p>
<p>
Suppose a person is using an electrical drill with a fault, such that
there is a short-circuit from the motor to the drill body. Although
he is "safe" using this faulty appliance with a floating supply,
the fault will not be detected; so long as he uses the appliance,
the system is no longer a floating supply. 
</p>
<p>
A serious hazard is unlikely; but the more people and appliances are
involved, the greater is the risk. For my part, I think that powering
a bunch of cellphone chargers (for example) from an inverter is an
acceptable risk. Why? Because each charger contains its own isolating
transformer (if it complies with European safety standards). The 
earth pin on the plug is not connected to anything. Still, it's 
difficult to tell what kind of equipment can (relatively) safely
be used this way.  
</p>


<h2>Why an inverter is different to a generator (and why this matters)</h2>
<p>
In a sense, an inverter is similar to a portable generator: it provides
a mains supply and can be operated in a fully floating configuration.
There's a lot more information and discussion about the electrical 
safety of generators than
there is of inverters, simply because generators have been around longer.
</p>
<p>
There is a way, however, in which an unisolated inverter is quite 
different to a generator, meaning that any advice you might receive
that applies to generators has to be treated with caution. A generator
is truly self-contained -- it is electrically connected to nothing but
the equipment it supplies. The same is not true with an inverter. As a
minimum the inverter needs a battery supply. In some cases this may be
augmented by equipment like solar panels. Whatever you do to the
inverter <i>affects everything connected to it</i>. 
</p>
<p>
The safety implications are therefore quite different. An <i>isolated</i>
inverter is more like a generator, and can be set up in a similar
way.
</p>
<p>
</p>

<h2>Isolated inverters -- are they an improvement?</h2>
<p>
An isolated inverter has a built-in isolating transformer. This means
that there is no electrical connection between the input (battery)
side and the output (mains) side. Power is coupled from one side
to the other magnetically. It's not perfect isolation, because 
some electrical current can leak across the transformer by 
capacitive coupling. Unless you're powering medical equipment, though,
this small amount of leakage is unlikely to be problematic.
</p>
<p>
When used in a fully floating configuration, the isolated inverter
offers no advantage over an unisolated one. The "isolation" is 
provided by the fact that there is no earth connection. However,
when a totally earth-free operating environment cannot be guaranteed, the
safety benefit of the isolated inverter quickly becomes apparent.
For example, even if the battery side of the inverter is 
earthed (intentionally or unintentionally), there is still no
path for fault currents across the inverter. The mains side of
the inverter is still a floating supply. If the neutral and
earth terminals of the mains output become bonded (accidentally
or intentionally), then the battery side will still be floating,
and cannot cause a shock. 
</p>
<p>
An alternative to using an isolated inverter is to couple an unisolated
inverter to a separate isolating transformer. These devices are widely 
available: they are the yellow and blue buckets often seen on 
construction sites. An isolated
inverter will usually be smaller and lighter than an isolating transformer
with the same power rating, because the transformer will be supplied
with high-frequency AC power, rather than mains frequency. Why this
is the case is a matter of electromagnetic theory, and beyond the
scope of this article. 
</p>
<p>
In practice, isolated inverters are more commonly used in permanent
installations, where the greater range of risks justifies the
additional expense. 
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Electrical safety is a complicated subject. In this article I've touched
on shock hazards, and tried to show why, where they exist, they are
not easy to mitigate.  
</p>
<p>
Of course, shock hazards are not the only risks associated with 
mains inverters. It's easy to overheat an inverter or, more likely,
its associated cabling. With many vendors, it's difficult to know
how far their specifications can be trusted. Even if you can avoid
the shock hazards, there are plenty of other things to take
care over.
