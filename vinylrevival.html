<h1>Why is there a vinyl revival?</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/record.png" 
  alt="record"/>
In my youth, for better or worse, I never really owned vinyl records.
My parents did -- they had a small selection of country and
"easy listening" LPs, and a stack of 45-RPM pop singles that were
carefully labeled with the kind of dance they might be
suitable for -- foxtrot, quickstep, waltz, tango, and so on.
</p>
<p>
The only vinyl record I owned was a single
of Meco's <i>Star Wars</i>, which I played on a Dansette
suitcase record player until it had been worn smooth.
The record, that is, not the record player; 
nothing about the Dansette could be described as "smooth".
</p>
<p>
So far as I know, these objects all ended up in landfill, and
were not much lamented. My medium of choice, from the early
70s until the invention of the audio CD, was the cassette tape.
In most respects, the cassette tape was an inferior medium to the
LP record, but cassettes were convenient, rugged, and portable.
At one point I owned thousands of cassette tapes; in fact, 
I still have a stack gathering cobwebs in my attic.
</p>
<p>
For people of my generation, the audio CD revolutionized how we
listened to music. A CD offered (in principle, at least)
better sound quality than a vinyl record and, if treated carefully,
would last forever. At the same time, CDs were as convenient and
portable as a cassette. I owned one of the first Sony "Discman"
portable CD players, and it never left my side until
broadband Internet access changed the landscape again in the
90s.
</p>
<p>
So, in short, I have no personal history with vinyl records. 
I feel no nostalgia for them, nor am I a particular admirer
of their characteristic sound signature. However, increasingly
I feel alone in this view. The reality -- and a strange reality
it seems to me -- is that for the last ten years or so,
vinyl record sales have surged. Although most of the big
names in the turntable industry, like Dansette and Garrard,
have long ceased trading, there is a brisk second-hand
market in their products. But you don't have to buy used
-- a number of companies are now using modern
manufacturing methods to produce good-quality equipment at
modest cost. It's no longer necessary to sell a kidney, to
own a real hi-fi turntable.
</p>
<p>
But why would you? What possible reasons can there be for 
the renewed interest in this archaic media format? 
</p>
<p>
<HR width="10%" color="#808080" size="4"/>
</p>
<p>
I think there's one potential explanation that we can put to bed
pretty quickly, although I approach this with some trepidation.
There are no <i>objective</i> grounds for thinking that vinyl records
offer superior sound quality to modern, digital media -- all
other things being equal (not that they ever really are --
more on this later).
I accept that there might have been a valid argument of this kind
in the early days of the CD. In the rush to get 
CDs to market, many music publishers pushed recordings
that had been mastered for vinyl directly to CD, without any 
consideration of the advantages offered by the new medium. For
example, vinyl records had to be mixed so that high-intensity 
(especially bass) sounds were in the
middle of the stereo field; if this wasn't done, there was a 
risk that the turntable's stylus would jump right out of the
groove. CDs had no such limitation. 
CDs had (in principle) a hundred-fold increase in 
dynamic range over vinyl, and yet no use was made of that
fact (sadly, it often still isn't). The low noise levels of
CD recordings offered no benefit when the source material was 
a 30-year old master tape. The
peculiarities of vinyl mastering and the undeniable limitations
of early CD players did not make for a sonically rewarding
result.
</p>
<p>
Those days are (mostly) gone, however. While there are still
a number of poor-quality CD recordings in publisher's catalogues,
most CDs, and other digital content, is now mastered specifically
for digital media. There's no doubt that digital music 
delivery is subject to inaccuracies -- primarily quantization
artefacts and jitter -- but these are utterly insignificant in
quality equipment, set against the
limitations of vinyl. 
</p>
<p>
The fact is that digital audio offers better accuracy, higher dynamic
range, lower noise, and hugely better channel separation than a 
vinyl record. Any characteristic of audio reproduction that can be
measured, measures better with digital technology. The limitations
of digital audio -- which nobody denies -- can be mitigated to
whatever extent is desired, by technological means.
Top-quality sound reproduction comes
at a price, of course, whether it's analog or digital; but it's a 
price that many have been willing to pay. The complication
is that whether one recording "sounds better" than another 
is not entirely an objective matter; it's a 
value judgement, based on a number of musical and non-musical
factors.
</p>
<p>
<HR width="10%" color="#808080" size="4"/>
</p>
<p>
Be that as it may, whatever is driving the "vinyl revival", it isn't 
sound quality, objectively assessed. To some extent, it could
be simple nostalgia. However, as I argued in my article on
<a href="retrocomputing.html">retrocompuuting</a>, there's
probably more than just nostalgia at work here -- but nostalgia
undoubtedly plays a part.
</p>
<p>
"Sound quality" is a hard thing to define, even in a laboratory
context. Some people are highly attuned to the microscopic
quantisation artefacts that affect digital recordings, but
are not particularly concerned about, say, errors in pitch
stability, or poor frequency response. Some people find the
tiniest intrusion of third-harmonic distortion absolutely
unbearable, but will tolerate large amounts of second-harmonic
distortion. Getting a single figure for "quality" that 
everybody agrees on is difficult, even when comparing the same
content on different media; when comparing 
<i>different</i> content on different media, it's probably impossible.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, I think it's important to understand that quality of audio
reproduction -- <i>however that term is understood</i> -- has only ever been
a niche concern. Most people listen to music using poor-quality
equipment in acoustically-hostile environments (trains, gyms, cars)
and are perfectly happy with it. In the days when I was designing
and building my own wardrobe-sized loudspeakers, most of my peers
were listening to cheap, plastic "solid state radios", as they
were then called, with no obvious signs of distress. Even now,
my kids walk around the house with music squawking out of their
cellphone speakers -- a sound that is like fingernails on a 
blackboard to me.
</p>
<p>
No -- for most people, music is part of a social backdrop, and the
fine details of reproduction are unimportant. It's possible to
make too much of "high fidelity".
</p>
<p>
It seems to me that some of the factors that lead people to
develop a new interest in vinyl records are similar to those that 
create the continued interest in 1980s computing; one of these
is comprehensibility.
Vinyl records are an entirely understandable technology. A little
needle wiggles in a groove, and a magnet-and-coil arrangement translates
that wiggling into an electrical signal, which is amplified and
sent to speakers. Fundamentally, the principle hasn't changed since
Edison's waxed cylinders in the Victorian era. CD technology is
much more obscure, and modern music-streaming technologies are 
totally bewildering. The vinyl turntable has a bunch of tweaks that
may, or may not, improve sound quality. Whether they do or not, their
operation is not hard to understand. You can increase drive belt 
tension, or the weight on the stylus; you can change the lateral
force on the tone-arm, and so on. People who really care about
their turntables spend hours fiddling with these things. What can
you adjust in the behaviour of a streaming audio service? Very little,
it turns out.
</p>
<p>
And then there's the undeniable <i>physicality</i> of a vinyl record.
A record is a tangible object that has to be handled in a particular
way. It has to be cleaned, cared for, and stored properly. 
There's even a particular smell associated with vinyl. 
A record is something you can have a <i>relationship</i> with.
</p>
<p>
Audio CDs have nothing to offer (musically) over digital streaming
services. You can fiddle with your CDs if you want but, in the end,
you'll get essentially the same sound from them as you get 
from the streaming
service. Most such services now offer CD-quality delivery, and some 
offer better-than-CD delivery. The poor old CD simply has no place in 
the modern audio world. It's not that it's obsolete in a technical
sense; rather, the same technical characteristics are 
available more cheaply and conveniently by streaming. This is why
you can buy CDs for pennies these days.
</p>
<p>
A vinyl record, though -- that's altogether different. 
The physicality is part
of the appeal, and that can't be superseded by on-line music services. 
It doesn't
matter how good the sound quality of your streaming service is, because
objective sound quality isn't really a key feature of vinyl, when
compared to the competition.
Streaming has killed the audio CD, but there's something about vinyl
that can't be replicated in any other format.
</p>
<p>
<HR width="10%" color="#808080" size="4"/>
</p>
<p>
The popularity of vinyl records seems to me to be entirely explicable
on non-technical grounds. Consequently, it surprises me when enthusiasts
continue to promote the "better sound quality" of records over
digital technologies. I'm quite prepared to accept that some people
<i>prefer</i> the sound of records, but there's no objective grounds
to think it's superior. I've heard people say that records sound
"warmer" or "more human" than digital recordings, but that's a 
euphemism for "inaccurate". It would be easy enough to simulate
these inaccuracies in a digital recording if that's what listeners
want. 
</p>
<p>
To be fair, though, there is potentially a reason to favour
good-quality vinyl recordings from the past, over modern digital
recordings -- but that's more about market forces than 
technology. Back in the 70s we had the technology to make
really good studio recordings for vinyl -- not as high-fidelity 
as
modern digital techniques, but plenty good enough for
most people. In those days, recordings of "serious" music,
and of a lot of popular music, were mastered to sound good on
top-notch playback equipment. In particular, the amount of
dynamic level compression was significantly less than is the
current practice. 
</p>
<p>
Despite what some people claim, level compression is a <i>necessary</i>
part of studio production -- many musical instruments are almost
impossible to record well without it. However, the amount of
level compression that is applied during mastering has increased
steadily over the last twenty years, for two reasons. First,
many listeners just appear to preter a musical presentation that 
sounds "louder". Second,
most studios are producing music for poor-quality equipment in
poor acoustic environments. These environments more-or-less
demand a high level of compression, to compensate for the ambient
noise.
</p>
<p>
Vinyl recordings from the 70s were usually mastered with much 
less compression than is now the norm. Orchestral music,
in particular, can sound more "theatrical" than modern recordings,
just because it was mastered to suit a different audience. There
was no need, in the 1970s, to master recordings for portable
players on the train, because there weren't really any portable players
at that time. 
</p>
<p>
Portable music players are wonderful devices -- I never go far
without mine -- but, to some extent, they are victims of their
own success. Their very ubiquity means that it's difficult for
studios to produce music that is intended for critical listening
in quiet environments. Arguably, art music has suffered less from
this effect than popular music, but all music has been
affected to some extent.
</p>
<p>
<HR width="10%" color="#808080" size="4"/>
</p>
<p>
So, in the end, why are we buying vinyl again? As I've tried to argue,
the objective comparison with digital music is irrelevant.
Most people don't care and, even for those that do, the technical
quality of vinyl is quite good enough. Most of us don't listen
in silent, acoustically-neutral rooms with sell-a-kidney equipment.
We may even <i>prefer</i> the sonic imperfections of vinyl. In
that case, non-musical factors become more important than
musical ones.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, vinyl records give us a feeling of nostalgia,
and a physicality that digital recordings can't match. 
</p>
<p>
Playing a
record isn't just an action, it's an event.
