<h1>Using an I2C analog-to-digital converter chip with the Raspberry Pi, from the ground up</h1>

<p>
<img src="img/chip.png" alt="Chip symbol" class="article-top-image"/>
Interfacing with analog devices or information sources is a key part of
most embedded Linux applications. Devices like the Rasperry Pi do not
usually have general-purpose analog inputs, although they might have
the ability to record analog audio.
</p>
<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>It is not usually possible to repurpose an audio input for accepting sensor data. Audio inputs are usually AC-coupled, and won't work at all with the slowly-varying voltages that most sensors present.</blockquote> 
<p>
In this article I describe how to use a simple I<sup>2</sup>C 
analog-to-digital converter (ADC) chip with the Raspberry Pi, for relatively
undemanding applications, from first principles.
By 'relatively undemanding' I mean 
reading the position of an analog joystick, or 
reading sensor data with a voltage
range of a few volts. Or, perhaps, checking the voltage of a stand-by
battery. I'm not talking about sampling millions of
times a second, or with nanosecond precision, 
or handling inputs of microvolts. By 'first principles'
I mean without the use of any libraries, and without any tools that
are specific to a particular Linux distribution. 
</p>
<p>
I'll be describing the details of connecting the hardware, and writing
code in C to read the analog values. 
I'm aware
that there are libraries that simplify interfacing devices like ADCs,
but they completely conceal the low-level details, and are therefore
of no educational value whatever.
</p>
<p>
There are other ways to connect an analog-to-digital converter to a 
Raspberry Pi, than using the I<sup>2</sup>C interface. However, I<sup>2</sup>C  
devices are cheap, easy to use, and easy to program. In this article,
I use the Texas Instruments ADS7830 device, because I happened to have
some in my parts bin. This device provides eight
single-ended, or four different inputs, with 8-bit sampling precision,
in a device that costs less than &pound;3. It's ideal for remote
sensing applications, because its power consumption is considerably
less than a milliwatt.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately for the experimenter, this device is available only in
a 16-pin surface-mount package. It's about 2mm square. For those of us
who lack the eyesight or fine motor control to solder up a device this
size, there are alternatives. 
</p>
<p>
There are many other devices with similar specifications to
the ADS7830, which can be programmed in almost the same way. An 
example is the NXP PCF8591, which is available in a conventional 
DIP package, suitable for use with breadboard or strip-board. 
Another approach is to use an ADS7830 pre-soldered onto a DIP
carrier. These devices are available from a number of suppliers,
on eBay and elsewhere, for not much more money than the basic device. 
</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>
Note that the carrier might have pull-up resistors on some of the
digital inputs, as the example above does. I'll return to this
point later.
</p>


<h2>About I2C</h2>

<p>
The I<sup>2</sup>C bus is a two-wire, relatively low-speed serial bus, that
supports multiple devices in a chain. Each device has an address,
so that devices on the same bus can be read and written independently. 
"Relatively low speed"
is, of course, a vague term. Even at its fastest, I<sup>2</sup>C 
is much slower than modern USB, but it's still faster than, say, a serial
terminal. The default I<sup>2</sup>C bus speed for the Raspberry Pi
is 100 kbits/second, known in the I<sup>2</sup>C world  as "standard" speed. 
In principle, the bus speed can be increased to 400 kbits/sec, or
"fast". There are faster I<sup>2</sup>C modes, but I don't think the Pi 
supports them, and I've had reliability problems even with the
"fast" mode.
</p>
<p>
I<sup>2</sup>C devices generally do not generate specific signalling
voltages. Instead, they pull down the signal line voltage to represent
 a binary
zero, or leave the line unchanged to indicate a one. In electronics terms,
this arrangement is sometimes known as "open collector", as the 
I<sup>2</sup>C line would traditionally have been connected to the
collector of a bipolar transistor. Of course, in order to send a 
signal, <i>something</i> in the connection chain must establish
a definite voltage, so that the signal voltage can be measured by
receiving devices.
Usually, only one device in the chain needs to do this. 
</p>
<p>
Most Raspberry Pi devices have their I<sup>2</sup>C connections
"pulled up" to the 3.3V line using resistors of a few kilohms. This
means that the I<sup>2</sup>C line voltages will wiggle between 
zero and 3.3V. Consequently, any I<sup>2</sup>C ADC used with the Pi
must be willing to work with 3.3V logic levels. In practice, most
modern devices do, although lower voltages are becoming more common. 
</p>

<h2>About I2C ADCs</h2>

<p>
There are many such devices on the market, and they all seem to 
work in broadly the same way. In general, the controller (the Pi, in
this case) will send a specific command byte on the I<sup>2</sup>C bus
to start a conversion.
Then the controller will read a byte (perhaps multiple bytes for 
higher-resolution devices) from the bus when converted
data becomes available. These ADCs are generally polled by the controller,
that is, the controller asks for values, one at a time. This mode
of interaction <i>can</i> be relatively fast, but there's a comparatively
high level of jitter -- that is, uncertainty in the timing of the 
conversions.  
</p>
<p>
Some I<sup>2</sup>C devices provide additional features, such as analog
outputs, in the same chip. They will generally operate in the same way
as simple, input-only devices, but there will be additional I<sup>2</sup>C 
write operations to set the output voltages. 
</p>
<p>
The ADS7830 device can, in principle, convert at 75,000 samples per
second -- but I'm not convinced that a Raspberry Pi will be able
to read the data at that speed. In practice, a conversion rate of 
a few thousand per second is about as much as can be expected, and that's
if there's nothing else on the same bus. In practice, I<sup>2</sup>C 
ADCs are usually used to sample at rates between a few per hour to perhaps
one hundred per second. Demanding applications will require both more
expensive hardware, and more elaborate programming techniques.
</p>
<p>
In designing a system that uses an ADC, you'll need to give some thought to
the signal voltage levels involved. The voltage sampled will be relative to
some voltage reference or other. In general, the maximum digital value will be
registered for an input voltage that matches the reference, and the 
minimum for zero volts, with respect to that reference.
</p>
<p>
If you're measuring (for example) a joystick position using a potentiometer,
then you'll need to supply the potentiometer with a reference voltage. 
However, if you have a sensor with a specific voltage range, then ideally
you'll need to supply a reference voltage that matches the peak sensor
value. For example, if your sensor voltage varies between 0.5 and 1.0 
volts, you'll ideally need to supply a 1.0 volt reference voltage. In
fact, ideally you'll supply reference voltages for both the upper and
lower voltage, but inexpensive ADC chips don't usually provide that kind
kind of sophistication.
</p>
<p>
In general, if you don't supply a reference voltage, then the analogue
voltage will be measured relative to some internal default. For the AD7830,
the internal reference voltage, if it is enabled, is 2.5V. If it isn't enabled,
then the reference voltage will depend on the supply voltage (more on
this below). 
</p>
<p>
Does it matter if you use a reference voltage that is higher than the 
sensor input voltage? Well, not always. If the input voltage is in the
range 0.0-1.0 volts, and the reference is 2.5 volts, then all the measurements
will lie in the bottom 40% of the range. The top 60% of the range will
be unused. This means that your 8-bit ADC will be providing an effective
resolution of about six bits. Whether that's a problem or not
depends on the application.
</p>
<p>
However the reference voltage is set, care needs to be taken 
with the analogue input voltage applied to 
inexpensive ADC devices. The input voltage can safely exceed the reference
voltage, although the measurements will be junk. But if the input exceeds 
the <i>supply</i> voltage
by more than a few hundred millivolts, or goes negative, the device
may be damaged. 
</p>


<h2>Enabling I2C on the Pi</h2>

<p>
Recent Raspberry Pi units have two I<sup>2</sup>C devices, both of which
are nominally available on the GPIO header. However, device 0 is 
normally reserved for internal use, so I'll be assuming the use of
device 1. When enabled, this device appears as <code>/dev/i2c-1</code>.
</p>
<p>
If you're running Raspbian Linux, there's a configuration utility
which includes I<sup>2</sup>C. Otherwise, it's easy to set up manually. 
</p>
<p>
First, you'll need to ensure that I<sup>2</sup>C is enabled in the
Pi firmware. For the standard firmware, this amounts to adding the
following values to <code>/boot/config.txt</code>: 
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
dtparam=i2c_arm=on
dtparam=i2c1=on
i2c_arm_baudrate=100000
</pre>

<p>
Depending on how your system is set up, the I<sup>2</sup>C modules
may load automatically, or they may not. If they don't, you'll need
to arrange for the relevant modules to be loaded before running
your program. Typically: 
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
modprobe i2c-dev
modprobe i2c-bcm2835
</pre>

<p>
If these set-up steps are correct, you should be able to use the
device </code>/dev/i2c-1</code>. It's worth installing the 
standard <code>i2c-tools</code> package if practicable, because it
provides the <code>i2cdetect</code> utility. This utility will query
the I<sup>2</sup>C bus for devices, and you should get a response
from the ADC on its device port.
</p>



<h2>Hardware configuration</h2>

<p>
The diagram below shows what I believe is the simplest possible
way to connect the ADS7830 to a raspberry pi. Only four connections
are needed to the Pi -- two, in fact, if the ADC gets its 3.3V 
supply from some other place.  
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/adc.png" alt="circuit diagram" width="720px"/>
</p>

<p>
There are a few things to note about this simple circuit. 
</p>
<p>
1. The manufacturer recommends a supply-decoupling ceramic 
capacitor of 100nF or similar,
close to the ADC chip. This is to reduce the tendency of the ADC
clock to pollute the supply connections. If the ADC chip is more than
a few inches from the Pi, an additional 10uF (electrolytic) capacitor 
may be necessary. This is to reduce fluctuations in the supply voltage
of the ADC chip caused by transient changes in current consumption. 
</p>
<p>
2. In most cases, you won't need the 10k pull-up resistors, because
the Pi has its own pull-ups. However, these internal pull-ups can
be disabled in configuration -- you'll need to include them <i>somewhere</i>
in that case. Using a relatively high value of pull-up allows the voltage
to be pulled <i>down</i> using a smaller resistor, if necessary.
If you get the ADC chip in a carrier, it might already have pull-up
resistors in place, in which case you don't need to duplicate them.
</p>
<p>
3. The A0 and A1 pins are for address setting. The ADS7830 is
pre-programmed to respond to device IDs in the range 0x48 - 0x4B. 
That is, there are four possible addresses, controlled by the settings
of A0 and A1. If you want to be really lazy, you can leave A0 and A1
unconnected, and they'll float high. This will make the device 
address 0x4B.
</p>
<p>
4. Although it's not evident from the circuit diagram, the 
ADS7830 has an "analog side" (pins 1-8) and a "digital side" (pins
10-16). You can take advantage of this when laying out the circuit.
Pin 9 is ground/0V for both the analog and digital sides -- there
is no separate analogue ground.
</p>
<p>
5. The ADS7830 has different input modes, with the eight analog
inputs forming four differential inputs. So IN0 and IN1 form a pair,
and so on. But these aren't <i>balanced</i> inputs -- both inputs in
the pair must have a voltage greater than 0V. You'll need level-shifting
if you want to handle balanced differential inputs.
</p>
<p>
6. This circuit does not provide the ADC with a reference voltage. 
The voltage range of the input will depend on whether the internal
reference is enabled or not (which is a matter of software configuration). 
If it is enabled, then the circuit will measure
0-2.5 volts. If the internal reference is not enabled, then the reference
voltage will float up towards the supply voltage. With 3.3V supply, the
reference voltage will actually equal the supply voltage, so the circuit 
will measure 0-3.3 volts (give or take a few millivolts). With
higher supply voltages, things aren't as clear -- see the manufacturer's
data sheet for full details. In any case, you'd want to question whether
the supply voltage is stable enough to form a reference voltage for
conversion.
</p>
<p>
It's difficult to give any more information about the voltage reference, 
because it depends entirely on the application.
</p>


<h2>Software</h2>

<p>
Programming the ADS7830 could hardly be easier -- all the difficult
stuff is done by the kernel driver. It's certainly possible
to get libraries that conceal the details but, frankly, there's simply
no need to. To read analog values from the device in C, here's the basic
process.
</p>
<p>
1. Open the device <code>/dev/i2c-1</code> for reading and writing. 
</p>
<p>
2. Issue an <code>ioctl()</code> call to set the device address. 
</p>
<p>
3. Send the relevant command byte to the device to start conversion. 
The command byte
will indicate which analog channel is to be read, among other things.
</p>
<p>
4. Read a byte from the device. This is the analogue value. 
</p>
<p>
5. Repeat from (3) as necessary.
</p>
<p>
There are really only a few lines of code that are slightly 
complicated, and are likely to vary from one ADC device to another.
Here is a snippet of code that forms the command byte. 
You can <a href="code/ads7830.c">download the full source here</a>.

</pre>

<p>
To understand what's going on here, it's necessary to look at the
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads7830.pdf">manufacturer's data sheet</a>, specifically page 13, which explains the
format of the command byte.
</p>
<p>
From the data sheet we can see that the command byte contains three
elements: one bit (bit 7) to indicate whether to use 
single-ended or differential
conversion, three bits (4-6) to identify which of the eight channels to
convert, and two bits (2-3) to control the control the conversion
properties. In general, conversion starts when bit 2 is set (PDO in the
data sheet). Bit 3 (called PD1) controls the internal reference. If 
PD1 is set (it isn't, in my example), then the reference voltage is
enabled, and the analog value is measured in the range 0-2.5V. If
PD1 isn't set, then the voltage range will be 0-3.3V.
Taking these two settings together, the bottom four bits of the 
command byte are 0x04. 
The final value of the
command byte is formed by bitwise OR-ing these three groups of bits.
</p>
<p>
One last point about software, in case it isn't obvious: the user
needs to have read and write permissions on <code>/dev/i2c-1</code>. 
Some Raspberry Pi Linux distributions create a specific group to
own the device, others will require the use of <code>sudo</code>, etc.
</p>


<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
It's generally not difficult to connect sensors and analog devices to
a Raspberry Pi, and interact with them using a C program. Sadly, even
this relatively straightforward task is not well documented. Most of
the examples you're likely to find are in Python, with all the 
details hidden inside inscrutable libraries. I hope this article
makes good the documentation deficit in a small way.
</p>
<p>
Designers should be aware -- in case it isn't obvious -- that the really
tricky part of analog-to-difficult conversion lies in getting the
analog signals in the range accepted by the converter, and establishing
an accurate reference voltage.
