<h1 id="gentoo-vs.-mx-linux-on-old-ish-laptops">Gentoo vs. MX Linux on
old-ish laptops</h1>
<p><img src="img/tux.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>I have a pathological dread of waste. The idea of disposing of
something that works, just because there’s a newer, shinier alternative,
makes me sick to my stomach. Maybe that’s a generational thing: I grew
up in a time and place where <em>nothing</em> was wasted. I find that I
am drawn to things that were made to last, and can be repaired. Nowhere
is this more apparent than in my choice of computers: I own no computer
more recent than 2017. My favourite desktop computer, in fact, runs
CP/M; I built it myself, with a soldering iron.</p>
<p>Linux has long been the go-to operating system for computers that,
while not necessarily ancient, aren’t based on the latest technology. In
fact, there may be no alternative, with that kind of hardware. So it
dismays me to see Linux becoming increasingly inappropriate for this
kind of use. Nobody much cares about keeping ten-year-old PC hardware
alive; in fact, I suspect there’s more interest in CP/M and the Z80. A
ten-year-old laptop has no retro charm: the only reason for continuing
to use it, is that to do otherwise would be wasteful.</p>
<p>Laptop computers present a particular challenge in this area: they
are usually too poorly cooled to realize the full power of their CPUs.
Why that’s such an issue –and, with Gentoo, it is – is a point I’ll
return to later.</p>
<p>I’ve been on a bit of a mission lately: to find which Linux
distributions are most effective on old laptops. For the last three
months I’ve been migrating my old hardware to <a
href="gentoo_winux.html">Gentoo Linux</a>, but I continue to search for
a more practical alternative.</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll report my experiences with <a
href="https://mxlinux.org">MX Linux</a>, particularly how it stacks up
alongside Gentoo. Now, it’s true that this is hardly a like-for-like
comparison: Gentoo isn’t really a Linux distribution in the way that,
say, Fedora and Ubuntu are. It’s more a collection of tools for building
a Linux installation according to certain rules. Historically, Gentoo
users have compiled most of their software from source, although
recently there have been moves towards a measure of pre-compiled binary
provision. Nevertheless, my criterion for comparison is simply this: how
easy do these competing Linux variants make it, to keep old laptops
alive and useful? So the comparison seems fair to me.</p>
<h2 id="gentoo-on-old-laptops">Gentoo on old laptops</h2>
<p>The great strength of Gentoo is that you can, with patience,
construct a Linux installation that is highly optimized for a particular
application. If you want a Linux that uses nothing but good-ol’ ALSA for
audio support, for example, you can have it. You can configure the build
system (‘Portage’) for ‘ALSA only’, and applications like Firefox and
VLC will get built without support for anything but ALSA as their audio
handler. Similarly, if I don’t want to use Wayland, or systemd, or
Bluetooth, support for these things can be compiled out.</p>
<p>The build rules affect not just how software is built, but
<em>which</em> software is built. That is, the dependency relationships
between software packages are governed by the same rules that control
the build process. With care and patience, you can install a Linux that
contains all of what you want, and little of what you don’t. In
principle, this is ideal for old hardware, which has no resources to
spare.</p>
<p>But here’s the catch: to use Gentoo to install Linux on old laptops,
you’re going to need <em>new</em> computers to do all the actual
compilation. This is because the further your needs are from the
mainstream, the more software will have to be compiled from source.
Although Gentoo now has a binary repository, it mostly holds software
that has been configured for mainstream use. And running on old hardware
is, sadly, a non-mainstream use of Linux these days. I can build a
version of Firefox that has ALSA support for audio, but I’ll
<em>have</em> to build it: I’m unlikely to be able to get a pre-built
binary package for it. And building Firefox on a 2015 laptop can easily
take three days. Yes, days.</p>
<p>Now, the Gentoo maintainers are aware of this problem, and have
workarounds, of a sort. Despite what I just said, you <em>can</em> get a
pre-compiled Firefox package with ALSA support: but it’s a trick. This
package provides the Pulse Audio variant of Firefox – which is widely
available as a pre-compiled binary – and a shim library to adapt it to
ALSA operation. This works, and all the messiness is largely invisible
to the user but, still, it’s ugly. Firefox will use a bit more memory,
and load the CPU a tiny bit more, than a pure-ALSA build.</p>
<p>The Gentoo binary repository provides, in some selected cases,
multiple binary variants of the same package, with different features
enabled. This makes it more likely that you’ll find a binary to suit a
non-mainstream installation but, in my experience, there isn’t enough
provision of this kind to make a significant difference to the amount of
compilation.</p>
<p>In short, unless you’re willing to compile software for your old
computers on a new one, you’re going to have to make compromises: do you
want to use more binary packages, at the expense of a sub-optimal final
installation, or live with more compilation? I should point out that
compiling all the software I use, to get the Linux I really wanted, took
nearly three weeks of round-the-clock compilation on a 2015 laptop.</p>
<p>Laptops are particularly badly hit by this compilation burden,
because they are usually inadequately cooled. It <em>shouldn’t</em> take
three weeks to compile a Linux installation on a ten-year-old i7 CPU –
that it does is a result of the fact that the CPU will have to be
severely throttled to keep its temperature under control, when running
at full CPU load with no breaks.</p>
<p>All in all, running Gentoo on an old laptop is a job for enthusiasts,
not for people who just want to use Linux for running applications. To
work well there will need to be a lot of compiling, and this will
probably have to be repeated every time there’s a significant update.
Desktop and server computers are less problematic in this area, because
they can usually run at full load without throttling. But, all the same,
the amount of compilation shouldn’t be underestimated, even there.</p>
<p>Don’t be fooled by the people who tell you that they’re running
Gentoo on decades-old Pentium systems and the like. Yes, this can be
done. But it’s done as an enthusiast’s exercise, like running
<em>Doom</em> on your refrigerator control panel – it’s possible, but
it’s not for day-to-day use.</p>
<p>I know I’ve said it before, but Gentoo’s unique advantages are
hardest to exploit where they would be most useful.</p>
<p>I also have to point out – for the purposes of the comparison that
follows – that Gentoo has no automated installer. You’re expected to
install it using command-line tools. However, the Gentoo documentation
is excellent, and the installation isn’t difficult; the time it takes to
read the documentation is a trivial part of the overall installation
time, if you’re building much of the system from source.</p>
<h2 id="mx-linux-on-old-laptops">MX Linux on old laptops</h2>
<p>MX positions itself as a ‘midweight, stable, simple’ desktop
operating system. It’s unashamedly a desktop system: there’s no
server-class or embedded installation. Like Gentoo, MX does not force
the use of systemd, and that’s usually a sign of a thoughtful approach
to software provision. MX is available with various integrated graphical
desktops, but its most popular variant is Xfce4. I use Xfce4 on Gentoo
and Fedora already, so I have some basis for comparing the MX
implementation with these alternatives.</p>
<p>MX is based on Debian, and can use software from the same binary
repositories as Debian and its derivatives, like Ubuntu. However, MX has
a whole stack of graphical software of its own, for customization and
administration. I found this software to be well-implemented and
functional; I sometimes even <em>use</em> it, rather than searching for
a command-line way to do something, which is my usual approach.</p>
<p>MX is more mainstream that Gentoo in that it provides a graphical
installer, as well as this bunch of graphical tools. This installer does
allow for a measure of customization, particularly as regards the disk
layout. It can cope with a disk that has existing partitions that have
to be preserved – not all Linux installers can, sadly. However, I didn’t
find the graphical partition manager any easier to use than simply
running <code>fdisk</code> at the prompt, as I had to with Gentoo.
Either you understand how Linux works in this respect, or you don’t: the
available tools won’t explain it to you. The installer offers relatively
little choice of which software to install – it’s optimized to create a
general-purpose desktop system. Still, this does make the installation
fast compared with, for example, Fedora. It’s not fair to compare the
installation time with that of Gentoo, because Gentoo will have so much
software to compile from source.</p>
<p>MX does not claim to be a minimal Linux and, although its basic
desktop installation is slimmer than, say, Fedora with Gnome, it’s still
general-purpose. If you’re trying to make every byte of memory and every
CPU cycle count, you’re going to have a lot of post-installation work to
do. For example, I only use ALSA for audio, not just because frameworks
like Pipewire and Pulse can use a heap of memory, but because it just
works better for me. The MX installer provides Pipewire, and all the
applications it installs are set up to use it. It’s not difficult to
disable Pipewire and go back to using ALSA – and I have – but this
requires making a lot of changes to the desktop configuration. I have to
replace the Pulse volume control with an ALSA one, for example. I also
have to install <code>apulse</code> and change everything that runs
Firefox to run <code>apulse firefox</code> instead, because the Firefox
binary has no ALSA support. None of these changes are rocket surgery,
but they do require a fair amount of knowledge, and some patience. Of
course, some users of old laptops will be happy to live with the
overheads of Pipewire, in exchange for the convenience it offers; but
some of the stock MX installation is nothing but eye-candy, and an enemy
of resource-efficiency. Again, to be fair to MX, I accept that MX does
not position itself as a minimal Linux installation, and I’m aware that
many will justifiably find my objections petty.</p>
<p>Both cosmetically and ergonomically, the Xfce4 set-up is slick. It
looks nice, and the elements of the desktop are conveniently laid out.
But, as I said, there are places where cosmetic impact has been chosen
over efficiency. For example, the default install uses Conky to display
date/time and system status information over the desktop wallpaper. This
is eye-catching, but uses a non-trivial amount of memory and CPU
(particularly updates every second) with little practical benefit on a
low-resource system. Of course, Linux being what it is, you can turn
this off, but you have to know how.</p>
<p>Compared with Ubuntu and Firefox I found it easier with MX to remove
and disable things that I don’t need, to conserve resources. For
example, I have no need for the <code>tumblerd</code> thumbnail
generator and, when I did <code>apt remove tumblerd</code> to get rid of
it, this didn’t strip out a whole chunk of the desktop with it. That’s
the kind of thing that tends to happen with Fedora and Ubuntu – all the
software is so tightly integrated that it’s hard to remove one thing
without breaking something else. On MX, the Thunar file manager
complained (just once) when I removed <code>tumblerd</code>, but
removing it didn’t take Thunar with it.</p>
<p>MX’s real competitor, if that’s the right word, is not Gentoo, but
the Xfce4 ‘spin’ of Fedora. Both are less bloated than the Gnome/KDE
behemoths that most Linux maintainers favour, but I suspect that MX has
the edge – just – where low resource usage is crucial. Also, Fedora uses
systemd, for better or worse, while MX does not have to.</p>
<p>I feel I should point out that, although I’m no fan of systemd,
removing it does not <em>by itself</em> make Linux better. No, really,
it doesn’t. That’s what sets MX apart from, say, Devuan: MX has a
character of its own, that goes beyond mere ‘lack of systemd’. Still,
doing without systemd probably saves a hundred megabytes or so, and that
might be significant on some hardware.</p>
<h2 id="comparison">Comparison</h2>
<p>In terms of RAM usage, Gentoo is the clear winner; in fact, it’s not
even close. Running Xorg and the basic Xfce4 desktop components requires
about 1.4Gb for MX, and only about 500Mb for Gentoo. That’s not just
because there are fewer processes running – although that’s part of it –
each process on Gentoo uses less memory than the same process on MX,
even when these are of the same version. So, for example, the Gentoo
build of Xorg (mostly compiled from source) used about 70Mb on my 2015
Thinkpad, against 140Mb on MX (a pre-compiled binary, of course).</p>
<p>I found these memory differences applied across the board. Even
Gentoo components that I <em>hadn’t</em> built from source used less
memory than their MX counterparts. I don’t know if that’s because Gentoo
binaries are built with better consideration for optimization, or if
they just include less code, and potentially can do less. Whatever the
explanation, the differences were evident.</p>
<p>Gentoo runs common applications a little faster, too – on the same
hardware many applications were noticeably snappier than they were on MX
(or Fedora, or Ubuntu, for that matter). Again, it’s not entirely
obvious why this should be the case, for applications that
<em>weren’t</em> built from source.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>There’s no getting away from the fact that Gentoo is a total bear to
install on an old laptop, and an even larger bear (a grizzly?) when it
comes to routine maintenance. I can set up MX and install most of the
applications I use in a couple of hours. Setting up Gentoo took
<em>weeks</em> on a 2015 laptop. This isn’t practical unless you have
some way to spread the compilation load. Of course, you can mitigate
this up-front set-up burden by configuring the system to be able to take
advantage of more pre-compiled components, but this will have
implications down the line.</p>
<p>I’ve heard of all sorts of tricks to make Gentoo’s compilation burden
more manageable on a laptop. Apart from the obvious one of doing the
compilation somewhere else, I’ve heard of people using cooling pads and
desktop fans, standing their laptops end-on to improve convection,
installing faster fans, and so on. All these measures are for the
enthusiast, as it using one computer to compile for another. I just want
to run applications.</p>
<p>I think the typical Gentoo user is like somebody who buys a Ferrari,
and then spends every weekend fiddling with the engine, so it can do 180
mph rather than 170. But I just want a Volkswagen.</p>
<p>So, stretching this metaphor a little further, I guess MX Linux is
the Volkswagen Golf of the Linux world. It will be practicable for many
people, and will work tolerably well with little maintenance. But it’s
not going to, um… fly on ancient hardware. OK, this is a mixed metaphor,
as well as a stretched one. But perhaps you get my point.</p>
<p>At present, I am persevering with MX Linux on my old laptops, but I
haven’t ruled out the possibility of going back to Gentoo, should the
need arise. I have back-ups of the Gentoo installation, of course,
because the prospect of another three-week set-up time hardly bears
thinking about.</p>
