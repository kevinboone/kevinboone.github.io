<h1>ARM assembly-language programming for the Raspberry Pi</h1>
<h2>12. Basic arithmetic operations</h2>

<p>
This example demonstrates some of the fundamental integer arithemetic
operations in the ARM instruction set.
</p>

<h3>Integer arithmetic</h3>
<p>
Integer arithmetic is arithmetic on whole numbers. It may, or may not,
accomodate negative numbers as well as positive ones,
 depending on the context. If the arithmetic
allows for negative numbers, it is described as <i>signed</i>, otherwise
<i>unsigned</i>. The ARM instruction set provides some signed and
some unsigned operations -- it's for the programmer to decide which
is most appropriate in a particular calculation. 
</p>
<p>
The ARM CPU does integer arithmetic in its 32-bit registers, although 
sometimes these can be used in pairs to handle larger numbers. A
32-bit register can store numbers in the range 0 to 4&nbsp;294&nbsp;967&nbsp;295 if
the value is treated as unsigned, or the range 
-2&nbsp;147&nbsp;483&nbsp;648&nbsp; to 2&nbsp;147&nbsp;483&nbsp;647 if signed.
Whether signed or unsigned, the register can hold one of 2<sup>32</sup>
discrete values -- the difference is in how they are interpreted. A
register is neither signed nor unsigned in itself. 
Signed arithmetic requires not only the proper
choice of instructions, but also attention to how overflows and 
carries are handled.
</p>
<p>
A 32-bit register can hold integers that are fairly large, for everyday
purposes. 32-bits is enough to store any Unicode character, or the 
number of seconds since Julius Caesar lived, or the number of frames
into playback of a movie. A 32-bit register isn't large enough to 
store the number of metres 
between stars, or the number of atoms in a planet but, in cases like
that, we don't usually need the precision to count individual metres
or individual atoms. Calculations like this typically call for the use
of <i>floating point</i> arithmetic, which embodies the notion of scale.
ARM CPUs may, or may not, have support for floating-point math; in these
articles I am assuming no such support, and working only with integers. 
</p>
<p>
It's worth bearing in mind, in fact, that some ARM CPUs don't 
even support integer division operations, although most recent devices
do. I don't believe that any 
have built-in support for integer modulo division, which is one of
the reasons I have chosen it for this article. In addition, it will
come in useful in future examples. 
</p>

<h3>The example</h3>
<p>
The modulo division <i>a mod b</i> is (for present purposes)
 the remainder when <i>a</i>
is divided by <i>b</i>. In integers, it can be expressed by this
formula: 
</p>
<blockquote>
a mod b = a - b * (a / b)
</blockquote>

<p>
To implement it, we'll need three basic integer operations:
multiply, subtract, and divide. 
</p>

<font color="#FF0000">//  easy to understand.</font>
<font color="#FF0000">mod:</font>
<font color="#FF0000">    push    {r4}</font>
<font color="#FF0000">    mov     %r4, %r0</font>
<font color="#FF0000">    sdiv    %r0, %r1</font>
<font color="#FF0000">    mul     %r0, %r1</font>
<font color="#FF0000">    sub     %r4, %r0</font>
<font color="#FF0000">    mov     %r0, %r4</font>
<font color="#FF0000">    pop     {r4}</font>
<font color="#FF0000">    bx lr</font>
</pre>

<p>
It's fairly obvious what <code>mul</code> and <code>sub</code> do.
<code>sdiv</code> is  <b>s</b>igned <b>div</b>ision. There's a
<code>udiv</code> unsigned operation as well -- the division instruction 
is the only one of the basic arithmetic operations that has different
signed and unsigned variants.  
</p>
<p>
Notice that even a relatively simple arithmetic expression like the
one I'm using to calculate the remainder requires a lot of 
assembly expressions. It's often possible to make the operation more
readable by using extra registers, or the stack, but these steps
tend to reduce efficiency.
</p>

<h3>A note on instruction syntax</h3>
<p>
Despite my example above, most ARM arithment instructions take
three operands. The full syntax for an <code>add</code> is
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">   <b><font color="#0000FF">add</font></b> <font color="#990000">%</font>result_register <font color="#990000">%</font>operand_register<font color="#993399">_1</font> <font color="#990000">%</font>operand_register<font color="#993399">_2</font>
</pre>

or

<pre class="codeblock">   <b><font color="#0000FF">add</font></b> <font color="#990000">%</font>result_register <font color="#990000">%</font>operand_register <font color="#990000">%</font>number
</pre>

<p>
That is, an arithmetic operation performs the calculation on two
registers, or a register and a number, and puts the result into another
register.
</p>
<p>
If only two operands are supplied, the first one is both the result 
register and the first operand. So when I write
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">   <b><font color="#0000FF">add</font></b> <font color="#990000">%</font>r<font color="#993399">0</font><font color="#990000">,</font>$<font color="#993399">1</font>
</pre>

<p>that's actually a short form of</p>

<pre class="codeblock">   <b><font color="#0000FF">add</font></b> <font color="#990000">%</font>r<font color="#993399">0</font><font color="#990000">,%</font>r<font color="#993399">0</font><font color="#990000">,</font>$<font color="#993399">1</font>
</pre>


<h3>Other integer arithmetic operations</h3>
<p>
ARM CPUs support a range of <i>shift</i> and <i>rotate</i> operations.
Some of these can be used to speed up certain arithmetic operations.
For example, a left shift by one bit amounts to multiplying by two. 
Two bits is a multiplication by four, and so on. However, these operations 
need to be used with care.  
</p>
<p>
There are also "carry" forms of the basic operations. For example,
<code>addc</code>, <b>add</b> with <b>c</b>arry, adds 1 to the result
if the carry flag is set. The carry flag will be set if a previous
arithmetic operation overflowed, so addition with carry is a useful
way to chain 32-bit operations together to form operations on
larger integers.
</p>

<h3>Integer arithmetic is complicated</h3>
<p>
This is not uniquely a problem with assembly programming, but assembly
does throw it into sharp relief -- integer arithmetic is 
surprisingly difficult to do robustly and efficiently. In fact, it's
difficult to do robustly <i>or</i> efficiently, and both together can be
a real challenge.
</p>
<p>
Problems don't usually arise when handling small numbers -- that is,
numbers much smaller than the maximum value of a register. It's when
handling large numbers that we have to be careful about deciding which
registers or memory locations hold signed or unsigned values, and
combining signed and unsigned operations appropriately. For example,
it's a common trick to shift all the bits in a register left one
place to performa a multiplication by two. This works fine until
you shift a binary 1 into the most significant position of an 
unsigned number, which then gets treated as signed in the next
operation. Your multiplication by two has become a multiplication
by minus two, which is unlikely to yield useful results.
</p>
<p>
Programmers often turn to assembly because they believe they can create 
smaller or more efficient code than a compiler can, and integer arithmetic
is one area that seems, on the face of it, to offer potential rewards
in this area. However, compiler designers have had many years to
optimize the code their tools generate, and we won't beat the compiler
by naive use of assembly. It takes real expertise and a good grasp
of math to do integer arithmetic effectively.
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>ARM supports add, subtract, multiply and, in most modern devices divide. It also has a range of shift and rotate operations.</p></li>
<li><p>A register is inherently neither signed nor unsigned -- the programmer has to implement signed or unsigned arithmetic by careful selection of operations and handling of overflows .</p></li>
<li><p>Simplistic application of integer operations rarely results in code that outperforms a compiler's output.</p></li>
