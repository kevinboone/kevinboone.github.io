<h1>Monitoring an INA219 chip in a Raspberry Pi battery-backed power supply</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/chip.png" 
  alt="Pi logo"/>
The Raspberry Pi, and similar systems, 
have a greater range of applications if they can be run on battery power. 
This is easily 
accomplished by powering the Pi's USB power input from one of the many
"USB power bank" products on the market. This approach is inexpensive
and simple to implement, but not very flexible. Most of these "power banks"
are very limited in the way they can be powered, but a bigger
problem is that they don't provide any way for the Pi to monitor the 
battery health. 
</p>
<p>
There are many battery supply products for the Raspberry Pi and similar
small systems. They can be powered by a wall adapter, or a car battery,
on sometimes by solar cells. Many of these systems include
the Texas Instruments INA219 current/voltage monitor chip, which allows
the Pi (or whatever) to monitor the battery status using an I2C
interface. 
</p>
<p>
These products typically come with some poor-quality software examples,
usually in Python, and with no meaningful documentation. The INA219
is not self-evident in operation, and integrating it with custom software
can be fiddly.
</p>
<p>
In this article I describe how to monitor battery status using the 
INA219 using simple, fully-documented C code. In order for the code to
make sense, I will explain in outline how the INA219 is used in a 
typical battery power supply. I won't be describing the electronics
in detail, but writing the software without some idea of the hardware
configuration is impossible. 
</p>
<p>
I'll be showing snippets of C code, but not a full application. 
The full application is available
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/pi-ina219">in my GitHub repository</a>.
</p>


<h2>What is the INA219?</h2>
<p>
The Texas Instruments INA219 is a current/voltage monitor with an I2C
interface. It's actually an analogue-to-digital converter with two
inputs, called "IN+" and "IN-". The INA219 measures the voltage on
IN- with respect to ground, and the voltage difference between IN+ and IN-. 
Both
these voltage values are made available on the I2C interface.
</p>
<p>
By connecting a small "shunt" resistance between IN+ and IN-, in
the path of current flow to the load, the INA219 can
measure both the load voltage and current, as we shall see. 
</p>
<p>
The INA219 is found in a huge range of power monitoring and power
supply applications. Most of the battery-power add-ons for the 
Raspberry Pi (and similar) use this device. 
</p>
<p>
The INA219 has a reputation for being rather fiddly to program. 
The good thing about using one with a Raspberry Pi is that there's
really no need to program it at all. The INA219's default,
non-programmed mode of operation
is perfectly satisfactory for most applications. Programming is
required if you want the INA219 to do power and current calculations
itself but, unless you're planning on sampling 
thousands of times a second, there's no problem with doing
these simple calculations in software.
</p>
<p>
To understand fully the operation of the INA219, the
<a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ina219.pdf" target="_blank">datasheet</a> is very helpful.
</p>

<h2>A simple circuit</h2>
<p>
The diagram below shows how the INA219 is typically used in backup 
power supply devices for the Raspberry Pi. It's only an
outline -- I'm not explaining how the battery charger and voltage
regulator work, because these components aren't really relevant to
using the INA219.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/pi-ina219.png" width="600"/>
</p>

<p>
In this circuit, when the Pi is running on external power, current
to charge the battery flows through the shunt resistance
<i>R<sub>shunt</sub></i> from the power source to the battery. 
The IN- terminal measures what the INA219 datasheet refers to as the
"bus voltage" and is, in this circuit, the battery voltage. The
bus voltage can be up to 32V. 
</p>

<p>
Using Ohm's law we can work out the battery current <i>I<sub>bat</sub></i>
 as <i>V<sub>bus</sub></i> / <i>R<sub>shunt</sub></i>.
</p>

<p>
When the Pi is running on battery power, current flows through the 
shunt resistance to the voltage regulator. Whether IN+ has a higher
voltage than IN- depends on the direction of flow of the battery
current, so the INA219 provides a <i>signed</i> measure of this
voltage, which the datasheet calls the <i>shunt voltage</i>. 
In short, the sign of the shunt voltage indicates whether the battery
is charging or discharging.
</p>

<p>
In the circuit shown above, a positive shunt voltage indicates that the
battery is charging -- because IN+ will be at a slightly higher voltage
than IN-. 
</p>
<p>
The choice of shunt resistance is important. The value needs to be
small so that power is not wasted in heating this resistance. However,
if it is too small, the voltage developed across it might be too small
to measure accurately. The INA219 has a precision of 10 microvolts in
measurement of the shunt voltage. However, there is a certain amount
of noise on this voltage, and we shouldn't rely on being able to measure
sub-millivolt voltages accurately. In low(-ish) current applications,
the shunt resistance is often in the order of 0.1 ohms, making
the shunt voltage in the region of hundreds of millivolts. The
maximum shunt voltage the INA219 can measure is +/- 320 mV.  
</p>
<p>
One important feature of the INA219 that I didn't show in the 
circuit diagram is the address setting mechanism. Pins 7 and 8
of the IC control the I2C address, in the range 0x40-0x4F. 
The address pins can be connected in various ways to provide this
range of 16 addresses -- full details are in the datasheet. 
</p>

<h2>A few words about batteries</h2>

<p>
Most low-voltage backup power supplies now use NiMH batteries, which are both 
inexpensive and compact. Compared to traditional lead-acid batteries
they're fiddly and relatively slow to charge safely, but their high
capacity-to-size ratio makes them almost ubiquitous in low-voltage
applications. 
</p>
<p>
As with most battery technologies, there's no obvious way to measure the
level of charge in the battery directly. All we can do is measure the
voltage, and try to infer the charge level. This is relatively easy to
do with NiMH batteries because the charge-voltage characteristic is
quite linear over most of the working voltage range.  
</p>
<p>
Consider the popular 18650 battery. Its nominal voltage is 3.7 V,
but fully charged and under light load it typically measures about 4.1 V. 
As it discharges at a constant current, the voltage drops steadily to
about 3V, and then rapidly thereafter. In practice, we can assume
that the voltage range of such a battery is 3 - 4.1 V, with 4.1 V
representing 100% charge, and 3 V representing no charge.  
</p>
<p>
If an 18650 battery has a charge capacity of 2400 milliamp-hours (mA.hr), 
we can broadly assume that if a fully-charged battery supplies (say) 
1 amp to its
load, it will continue to supply power for about 2.4 hours. Over that
time period, the battery voltage will drop from about 4.1 V to about 3 V.
So we can -- in principle -- estimate the amount of run-time left on
battery power, by measuring the battery voltage and the load current.
However, what constitutes "zero charge" depends to some extent on what is
being powered. If there is some minimum voltage which the battery has to
maintain, in order to power the equipment, then we should take that as the
"zero charge voltage", for the purposes of reporting charge level. 
</p>
<p>
In practice, the battery voltages that represent full charge and no charge
may have to be determined experimentally: the figures quoted by manufacturers
are usually only nominal. 
</p>

<h2>Interfacing the INA219</h2>

<p>
The INA219 acts as an I2C slave device, and can be set up using
Linux I2C devices in the usual way.

   <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">else</font></b>
  <i><font color="#9A1900">// Error</font></i>
</pre>

Once set up, the interaction is by ordinary <code>write()</code> and
<code>read()</code> calls on the file descriptor.
</p>
<p>
The INA219 has six internals registers, of which my simple example 
application only 
uses two. These are the shunt voltage register (register 1), and
the bus voltage register (register 2). The other registers either
program the device, or provide readings of current and power, based
on programmed calibration data. Since we'll be doing these calculations
in software, none of these additional registers are used. 
</p>
<p>
Without programming, the INA219 reads the bus (battery) voltage 
with 4 mV precision, in the range 0-32V, and the shunt voltage
with 10 uV precision in the range +/- 320 mV. Different ranges can
be programmed but <i>this does not improve accuracy or precision</i>.
The only difference caused by programming is in the way the data
bits are organized in the INA219's registers. This is potentially
of importance when interfacing with an unintelligent controller, but
otherwise of no great interest, since we can jiggle the bits around
in software. 
</p>
<p>
Reading a register in the INA219 follows a similar protocol to many
other I2C devices -- write the register number to the I2C device, then
read the data. In this case, the register number is an eight-bit value
(of which only a small number of values is used), and the data read
is a 16-bit value. So reading a register amounts to writing one byte
to the I2C device, and then reading two bytes. 
If we use a parameter whose type is
<code>int16_t</code>, a function to read a specific register can be
implemented as follows.

</pre>

<p>
It's important to understand that the value read from the INA219's
registers is neither signed nor unsigned (necessarily) -- it's a collection
of bits, whose individual meanings are described in the datasheet. 
As it happens, with the shunt voltage measured with the default
320mV range, the value in the register is, in fact, a simple
signed value, giving the voltage in 10 uV units. So to get the 
shunt voltage in mV, we just read the register (as a signed value),
and divide the number by 100 (because multiplying by 100 is the same
as multiplying by 10, then dividing by 1000).
</p>
<p>
The bus voltage register is a bit more complicated. Its layout is
described on page 23 of the datasheet. For our purposes, all we
need to know is that the bus voltage is packed into the highest
13 bits of the register, and is <i>unsigned</i>. The bottom
three bits in the bus voltage register have entirely different purposes. 
The 13-bit value is the bus voltage in units of 4mV. 
</p>
<p>
So, to get the bus voltage we need to read the bus voltage 
regulator, shift its contents right three places (without treating
the highest bit as a sign), then multiply by four. My sample code
uses an uglier, but faster, way to achieve the same end:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#008080">uint16_t</font> regval <font color="#990000">=</font> <font color="#990000">(</font>uint16_t<font color="#990000">)</font> <i><font color="#9A1900">//.. read register contents</font></i>
<font color="#009900">int</font> bus_voltage_mv <font color="#990000">=</font> <font color="#990000">(</font>regval <font color="#990000">&amp;</font> <font color="#993399">0xFFF8</font> <font color="#990000">)</font> <font color="#990000">&gt;&gt;</font> <font color="#993399">1</font><font color="#990000">;</font>
</pre>

<p>
The voltage value in the bus register is effectively left-shifted
three bits (because it occupies bits 3-15). This shift means that it's
effectively multiplied by 8 to start. We want this value multiplied
by 4 (mV), so we shift it right one place.
</p>

<h3>Calculating the battery state</h3>
<p>
Once we have the bus voltage and shunt voltage, by reading the 
registers and fiddling the bits as required, all the interfacing
to the INA219 is done. Everything else is a matter of simple
arithmetic.
</p>
<p>
First, we work out the current percentage charge by seeing where the 
battery voltage lies between the minimum and maximum battery voltage.
If the battery voltage is half-way between the minimum and maximum, we
take it to be 50% charged. 
</p>
<p>
Then we work out the battery current from the shunt voltage using
Ohm's law, bearing in mind that the sign of the shunt voltage indicates
whether the battery is charging or discharging.
</p>
<p>
When we know the percentage charge, and the battery current, it's a matter
of arithmetic to work out how long it is until the battery is
fully charged or fully discharged.
</p>
<p>
These calculations are in the function <code>ina219_get_status()</code>
in the sample application. 
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
It's actually much easier to use the INA219 in a C program than the
datasheet would suggest -- so long as you don't have to program it.
When used with a general-purpose computing device, there's actually
no advantage to programming it, because its default mode of operation
is appropriate.
