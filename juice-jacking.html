<h1>Juice-jacking -- it's a problem, but not because it's a problem</h1>

The modern Internet is a hostile place, and smartphones are a rich source
of data that can potentially be stolen and abused. So it's no surprise
that people are concerned about ways in which villains can exploit their
cellphones remotely. The "juice-jacking" scare seems to have started about
ten years ago, and enjoyed a brief notoriety before disappearing.
Recently, however, it's surfaced again -- warnings are being
promulgated in all sorts of places, by people who ought to know
better. For example, the DuckDuckGo search engine's blog has
a 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.spreadprivacy.com/privacy-risks-usb-charging/">warning about it</a>. I have a lot of time for DuckDuckGo, and I use their search engine all the time.
However, a privacy-focused organization like DuckDuckGo really ought
to understand technology better than this.
</p>
<p>
For those who don't know, "juice-jacking" is the alleged practice of
using public USB charging stations to get unauthorized access to the
contents of user's smartphones. There was a time -- ten years ago --
when there was at least a notional risk that this could happen. 
If the charging station was, in fact, secretly connected to a computer, 
then the 
USB connection
could be used for data access, not just charging. It's likely that most
smartphone users don't use USB connections this way any more, and don't
even realize that a data connection over USB is even possible. It is, though --
some or all of the internal data storage, along with data stored on
any SD card, is somewhat accessible. In the Android world there's also
the Android Debug Bridge (ADB), which provides even lower-level access
to the cellphone's data and configuration.
</p>
<p>
Over time, however, smartphone manufacturers have not only reduced the amount
of data that can be extracted from a USB connection, but also made it harder
to establish a data connection without the user's knowledge. All 
modern iOS and Android phones
will warn the user when a data connection is initiated over USB, and require
positive action before enabling it. The ADB needs to be enabled
generally in the device -- a process that is not well advertised -- and
also enabled for each new data connection. 
So far as we know, "juice-jacking"
hasn't been a practical proposition for ten years, and probably
wasn't a significant risk even before then.
</p>
<p>
So why has it become an issue again? Well, frankly, I don't know.
The recent scare appears to have started when the 
Los Angeles County District Attorney's office <a target="_blank" href="http://da.lacounty.gov/community/fraud-alerts/juice-jacking-criminals-use-public-usb-chargers-steal-data"/>issued a fraud alert</a> about the practice. According to the
DA's office:
</p>

<blockquote>
"...criminals load malware onto charging stations or cables they leave plugged in at the stations so they may infect the phones and other electronic devices of unsuspecting users."
</blockquote>

<p>
There's no explanation how this might happen and, in fact, it's highly unlikely to be possible. A number of technology journalists contacted the LA County DA's office for an explanation but, so far as I know, none has been forthcoming. Certainly, the DA's office was unable to cite even one specific instance of the practice. 
</p>
<p>
It seems to me that a technologically-inexperienced member of the DA staff got
wind of the "juice-jacking" scare from some unknown source, and propagated it,
thinking to be doing everybody a favour. Other security-minded organizations
picked up on the warning and, lacking any deep technical knowledge, simply
propagated it -- again, thinking to be doing us all a favour.
</p>
<p>
If I were in a cynical mood, I would also wonder whether commercial providers of security products would actually be quite keen to republish a story like
this. After all, their business model depends on maintaining
a climate of fear and paranoia.
</p>
<p>
Should we be worried?
</p>
<p>
Well, yes; but but not because "juice-jacking" is a real threat -- it almost
certainly isn't. We should be worried because, in a world where we are subject
to all manor of genuine on-line threats, we can't afford to be distracted by
bogus ones. The fact is that the typical cellphone user won't have the
technical knowledge to assess the validity of a threat -- in fact, very few
people will. There's a very real risk of "threat fatigue" in the world of
information technology -- if people are bombarded by purported threads from all
sides, how can they possibly be expected to take them all seriously? 
</p>
<p>
I notice a large amount of shoulder-shrugging, where on-line security is
concerned. It seems that people increasingly think either (a) there's not
really a problem or (b) there is a problem, but there's nothing they can do. If
we want to prevent this situation getting worse, we really need to avoid
propagating camp-fire stories.
