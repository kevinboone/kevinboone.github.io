<h1>Why pitch is not the same as frequency</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/notes.gif" alt="musical notes"/>
To some extent, "pitch" is just a musical term for what a physicist would
call "frequency". In conventional orchestral tuning, for example,
the note "A" above middle C has a frequency of 440 Hz. The pitch
an octave above that A has double the frequency, 880Hz, and so on.
Pitch, in other words, is just a musical word for frequency.
Two notes of the same pitch have the same frequency, right?
</p>
<p>
Well, no. In physics, frequency is a well-defined, measurable quantity
-- it's the number of times something repeats in one unit of time.
In music, pitch is how we <i>perceive</i> frequency. The distinction
might appear to be a nit-picking one but, in fact, it isn't.
</p>
<p>
Consider the following two musical samples. They're in FLAC format because,
although MP3 would be more compact, this demonstration doesn't work
so well with lossy audio compression. The first sample is a mathematically-generated perfect sawtooth wave; the second is, well, something different. 
The comparison will work best with the samples played over decent speakers
or headphones; but it will probably work even when played on a laptop or
phone speaker. This is remarkable in itself, as we shall see.
</p>
<p> 
<a href="audio/pitchfreq_300.flac">300 Hz sawtooth tone</a><br/>
<a href="audio/pitchfreq_150_no_fundamental.flac">Simulated 150Hz sawtooth tone</a><br/>
</p>
<p>
Almost everybody perceives the second sample as having a pitch an octave
lower than the first, that is, half the frequency (150 Hz), and having
a similar timbre. But, in fact, both these
samples have a frequency -- at least a fundamental frequency -- of 300 Hz.  
</p>
<p>
By way of illustration, the waveforms shown below are of the 
simulated 150Hz tone
(top) and the 300 Hz tone (bottom) on the same time axis.
Although they aren't in phase, it's pretty clear that both waveforms
have the same period (3.33 msec, as it turns out). The simulated
150 Hz tone has a much more complicated structure, which is what
gives rise to the phenomenon.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
If you heard the pitch illusion on a laptop or phone speaker, that's
even more remarkable, because your speaker's frequency response probably
does not even extend down to 150 Hz. The sound you perceive is one that the
speaker probably can't even produce.
</p>
<p>
The key to understanding this oddity is to understand that natural
music (and speech) tones are not composed of pure sinewaves. So far as
I know, no musical instrument produces a pure sinewave. A nylon guitar
string, plucked gently, is <i>almost</i> a sinewave after the initial
plucking sound has died away, but even that isn't perfect. 
</p>
<p>
Consider a bowed string, as on a violin. The string will vibrate in 
many modes simultaneously whilst it is being bowed. 
The lowest-frequency mode of vibration will
be along the whole length of the string. This mode has the maximum 
amplitude of deflection of the string about half-way along its length,
whilst the ends of the string are held completely still by the bridge
and the nut.
</p>
<p>
There will also be another mode of vibration, where the centre of the
string is stationary, with vibrational maxima at the
one-quarter and three-quarter length points. This mode of vibration has
twice the frequency of the full-length vibration. There will be another
mode at three times the frequency, then another at four times, and so on.
The modes are not of equal amplitude, and their amplitudes vary according
to how the string is bowed. It is this combination of frequencies that 
gives the violin its distinctive timbre.
</p>
<p>
The frequency mode that corresponds to the full length of the string is
generally called the 'fundamental', while the higher frequencies are
called either 'overtones' or 'harmonics'. In general, musicians seem
to prefer the term 'overtones', while physicists prefer 'harmonics'. 
</p>
<p>
We see the same kind of harmonics generated in all music instruments that
work by mechanical vibration. For example, the column of air in a 
flute or clarinet has multiple vibrational modes. The skin of a tuned
drum has an even more complex vibrational pattern, because it's
three-dimensional.
</p>
<p>
The harmonic structure of a mathematically-perfect sawtooth wave isn't
hugely different from that of a bowed violin string -- there's a fundamental,
and a series of harmonics at gradually decreasing amplitudes. 
So the "A" above 
middle C has has the fundamental at 440 Hz, and higher harmonics at
1320Hz, 2200 Hz, and so on.
</p>
<p>
Let's look at the frequency spectrum of the simulated 150 Hz tone.
I generated this plot using a software spectrum analyser although, in 
fact, I know exactly what its frequency components are, because I
generated them in software. But checking the spectrum is something you
can do yourself on the FLAC files, if you don't believe me (and many
people don't).
</p>

<p>
<img width="512px" src="img/pitchfreq_spectrum.png" alt="spectrum plot"/>
</p>

<p>
The simulated 150Hz tone actually has four harmonics: at
300 Hz, 450 Hz, 600 Hz, and 750 Hz. Although it isn't clear in the
displayed spectrum, these harmonics have gradually-decreasing 
amplitudes, as is the case with most musical tones. What's most important
is that the spectrum shows <i>nothing</i> at 150 Hz -- but we could
have guessed that by looking at the waveform, which repeats at the
same frequency as a 300 Hz sawtooth.
</p>
<p>
The overtones of the simulated 150 Hz tone don't correspond to any
musical instrument -- not one that I know about, anyway. As the 
fundamental frequency is 300 Hz, if this were a musical tone 
the next harmonic would be at 600 Hz or higher, not 450 Hz.
</p>
<p>
If an instrument playing at 300 Hz wouldn't have harmonics at 450 Hz 
and 750 Hz, what would? In case you haven't guessed -- it's an
instrument playing at 150 Hz. A 150 Hz sawtooth, or a bowed violin 
string, would have harmonics and 300 Hz, 450 Hz, 600 Hz, and 750 Hz --
exactly as the simulated tone does.
</p>
<p>
It turns out that the human ear-brain combination is very good at
harmonic analysis. The structure of the cochlea -- the sensor part of
the ear -- is a resonating chamber with a huge number of distinct
frequency sensors. The analysis isn't done in the brain entirely --
the first part of the analysis is done in the ear itself. 
</p>
<p>
In early life we become very familiar with the sounds created by 
vibrating bodies -- most obviously the human voice. Vocal sounds
are caused by the vibration of the air column in the trachea. We develop an 
expectation that a tone will have a particular pattern of harmonics,
broadly matching those of the voice. This expectation is so strong
that we interpret the simulated 150 Hz tone as a pattern of harmonics
that matches an object vibrating at 150 Hz -- even though there is
absolutely no vibrational component at that frequency. In short, our
ear-brain combination pays more heed to the frequency components than
to the fundamental frequency, when assigning a pitch to a sound.
</p>
<p>
There's another very simple way to hear the phenomenon described in
this article, if you have a piano (electronic or acoustic) available.
Just play the bottom (left-hand) octave of the piano, as a descending
scale. I would imagine that you hear each note in this scale as 
a lower pitch than the preceding one. And, yet, if your piano is
conventionally tuned, the lowest five notes (at least) are below
the usual limit of human hearing (20 Hz). 
</p>
<p>
If you play the lowest <i>two</i> octaves of the piano as a descending
scale, you'll probably notice a distinct change in timbre somewhere
between the two octaves. Although the pitches (as perceived) continue
to decrease as you play down the keyboard, at some point your ear loses
the ability to respond to the very lowest, fundamental frequency. 
However, the overtones corresponding to that fundamental frequency
are still present, and still registered by your ear. So your brain
fills in the missing fundamental, and assigns the pitch of that 
fundamental to the note you perceive. However, the bottom few
notes sound "tinny" (lacking a better word), presumably because we
can't hear the fundamental frequency.
</p>
<p>
In short, pitch isn't the same as frequency. "Pitch" is something
we perceive, based on frequency analysis caused by our brains. It may,
or may not, correspond to frequency in a specific musical tone.
