<h1>A review of the Leak Stereo 130 and CDT</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/notes.gif" alt="musical notes"/>
Like a lot of people these days, I'm spending most of my
working day in my home office. So I thought I'd treat myself
to an upgrade to the old Denon compact music system in
the office. The 
Denon wasn't bad by any means, but it had no DAC, no support
for phono (turntable), and no subwoofer output. So it was
surrounded by a bunch of other electronic doohickies, each with
its own power supply. 
</p>
<p>
Given the environment, I don't need a lot of output power, but
compactness and lack of clutter 
is crucial. I'm fussy about sound quality, but I'm not
precious or pompous about it. Consequently, I won't have a lot to say about
sound quality in what follows -- I'm more interested in 
the practical aspects. I don't really have the vocabulary to 
describe sound quality, and I think it's too subjective even
to try.
</p>
<p>
Although I use Spotify and Qobuz, my main source of music is
my huge stack of audio CDs, some of which I've had since the
1980s. I've ripped these all to disk, and I can play them on
a computer, but I prefer to play the real CDs. Consequently,
I wanted a compact audio system with a built-in CD, or
a matching amplifier/CD pair. In the end I went for
the pair, simply because it was cheaper.
</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<h2>Overview and competition</h2>
<p>
Leak's Stereo 130 is an integrated audio amplifier with about
45W RMS output power, and a comprehensive set 
of analogue and digital
inputs and outputs. CDT is a CD transport, that is,
a CD player with no analog processing parts; it's designed to be
used with a separate 
digital-to-analog converter (DAC), or one built into
an amplifier.
</p>
<p>
The amplifier and CD transport can be used 
independently,
but it's pretty clear that they were designed
to be paired. They are of the same size and shape, with
similar styling, and are operated by the same remote
control.
</p>
<p>
The amplifier/CD transport pair can be had for about
&pound;1100 without the wooden trim (of which, 
more below). To my mind that's a lot of money, and I expect
a great deal. For the most part I haven't been disappointed;
but nothing's perfect, as I will explain in due course.
</p>
<p>
The Stereo 130 is one of the few amplifiers on the market
to have both asynchronous USB and phono (vinyl) inputs.
It's similar -- in this respect and others -- to
Quad's <i>Vena II</i>. The Stereo 130/CDT combination offers
similar features to Quad's <i>Artera Solus</i>, at a 
similar price, although the <i>Solus</i> does not have
a phono input. Audiolab's <i>Omnia</i> does have a phono
input, and also supports network streaming, but it's
considerably more expensive.  
</p>
<p>
Leak's offering is not a compact or single-box audio
solution. Although it is versatile, with support for many
types of audio source, it doesn't have any network 
streaming features,
and there's no indication that Leak will be releasing
a model that does. Quad's <i>Vena II Play</i> has 
network streaming, and is only about &pound;100 more
expensive than the basic Vena II.
</p>
<p>
Despite the English heritage, Leak audio devices are made in China
by the IAG company, which originated in Hong Kong. Although the
company retains
some UK connections, "Leak" is now simply a brand name. That's not
a criticism -- the products must stand or fall on their own merits.
But if you're looking for an authentic piece of English audio
heritage, bear in mind that Leak's original products are still available,
and are relatively easy to refurbish and maintain.
</p>
<p>
IAG also owns the Quad, Audiolab, and Mission brand names; it's 
likely that products from these brands share components and design
elements.
</p>


<h2>Size, shape, and aesthetics</h2>
<p>
Both the amplifier and the CD transport are available with
metal or wooden casing. Leak says that
the wood is walnut veneer, although the veneering is
not visible, and the wooden units look very elegant. 
The wooden casing
adds about &pound;100 to each item, and removes about
twenty years from the aesthetic. I can see why 
many people would prefer this look, but I'm not inclined to
pay extra for purely cosmetic features.
The art deco-style panel logo 
is the same with both case styles, and is anachronistic
in both -- it was not used (as I recall) on original Leak products. 
</p>
<p>
Both units are about 330mm wide by 150mm tall by 280mm deep
with the wooden case, or 300mm by 120mm by 280mm without.
They will stand on a 12-inch shelf, but only with the front of
the cabinets sticking out a little. Fortunately, the rubber feet
are large enough that the fronts <i>can</i> stick out safely.
While this would not affect everybody, it would have been a
deal-breaker for me if the units had not fit into the shelf
space I have available.  
</p>
<p>
In fact, one of the main reasons I bought the Leak over the
similar Quad Vena II is that the latter is 20-30mm deeper.
Although the Quad is smaller in the other dimensions, it wouldn't
have fit on my self. Given that the Leak and the Quad amplifiers
are functionally almost identical, seemingly minor things like this
can amount to deciding factors. 
</p>
<p>
Both the amplifier and CD transport have a substantial metal 
front panel, about
5mm thick. This is more apparent in the units without
wooden cases, which look more industrial in general, even to
the extent of having prominent, visible fastenings.  
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, the Leak wooden case isn't just trim -- it's
the actual case. Pro-Ject Audio makes wooden bling for its
devices -- the wooden panels just attach to the metal case using
magnets. Leak has not been this cynical. 
</p>


<h2>Controls - amplifier</h2>
<p>
The Stereo 130 has retro-style controls -- big fat knobs
you can twiddle. The volume control is motorized, so its
actual position changes when using the remote control.
This isn't a gimmick -- the volume control is an analog
tracked potentiometer, not some kind of digitally-controlled
attenuator. So it has to be operated by a motor. In my unit
the potentiometer appears to be an Alps part -- these are 
expensive devices with a reputation for long life. This matters,
because a poor-quality potentiometer can eventually become
scratchy and erratic.
</p>
<p>
There are small knobs for bass, treble, and balance, all of
which are defeated by the "direct" button. With all 
three knobs in the centre position, enabling "direct" mode
has no audible effect that I can discern -- I suspect that
"direct" mode just exists to throw a bone to the audio snobs
who think that any kind of signal processing is a no-no.
Having said that, I should point out that it isn't a fake --
the "direct" mode actually switches out part of the 
processing logic, as evidenced by the solid thunk of relays
when you press the button.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I use the bass, treble, and balance knobs all the
time, and I'm glad they're available. Balance is particularly
important because I hear better in one ear than the other.
The bass and treble controls have a fairly subtle effect, compared
to other amplifiers I've used that have similar controls.
Leak says the control range is +/- 6dB.
</p>

<h2>Controls - CD transport</h2>
<p>
There's not really a lot to say here. There's the usual
play/forward/reverse, etc., plus an input selector to
switch between CD and USB stick. The front panel display
is bright enough to light a room in the dark and,
although it can be switched off completely (using the remote),
it can't be dimmed (so far as I can see). When playing a 
CD, the display shows the track and the track time; so far as
I know, it can't be switched to showing the number of
tracks or the total time. 
</p>


<h2>Remote control</h2>
<p>
Both the Stereo 130 and the CDT are supplied with remote
controls -- and they are identical. The same remote operates 
both devices. It's wasteful, in a way, to have two identical
remote controls but, I guess, handy to have a spare. 
</p>
<p>
The remote control is the usual black plastic lump. You have
to select specifically which device to control, using the 
"A" and "CD" buttons on the remote. This leads to some oddities. 
For example, the up/down volume buttons have no
effect on the CD player when it is playing, so 
it would have been nice if they could
have controlled the, um..., volume when in CD mode. 
How difficult would that have been?
</p>

<h2>DAC</h2>
<p>
The Stereo 130 has four digital inputs -- five if you count
the Bluetooth -- two S/PDIF optical inputs, one coaxial
S/PDIF, and one asynchronous USB. 
</p>
<p>
The DAC is based on the ESS ES9018 device, which is a respectable
chip. Part of its appeal lies in the low-jitter oscillator
but mostly, I think, in the upsampling frequency of up to
384 kHz. Of course, you can't make data that isn't there,
and this frequency is a long, long way beyond what the
human ear can hear. However, upsampling 
to this extent makes it much easier
to design the analog low-pass filter that is an essential
part of digital-to-analog conversion.  
</p>
<p>
Of course, there's more to the design of a DAC than a single
chip -- the analog filtering is very important, as is the 
stability of the power supply. I can't really comment on
either of these in the Leak amplifier.
</p>
<p>
The DAC is claimed to be able to support absurdly high sampling 
rates. I can't comment on this, but it certainly works fine
with 24-bit/192 kHz material -- at least, with USB input. It's
not entirely clear whether the optical/coax inputs support 24-bit
samples. Why should this be in doubt? Well, the S/PDIF interface 
-- whether optical or electrical -- is really designed for 20-bit samples.
Each data frame has a 20-bit audio packet and then four bits of
"auxiliary" audio. It's generally accepted that not all equipment
vendors will use the auxiliary audio bits; some do not even use
all of the main 20 bits. After all, CDs aren't recorded with more than
16-bit precision. 
</p>
<p>
Many retailers say that the Leak 130 supports 24-bit/192 kHz S/PDIF
streams, but I haven't seen anything from the company itself that
confirms this. It probably does but, frankly, the difference between
20-bit and 24-bit audio is unlikely to be very obvious.
</p>
<p>
I listened to the 130's DAC with various digital sources using
headphones and the same headphone amplifier, alongside my
Pro-Ject S2 DAC. Frankly, I couldn't tell them apart. 
Both sound quite bright (lacking a better word) to my ears 
compared to, for example, my Astell and Kern portable player.
That's not a criticism, just an observation. Unlike the
Pro-Ject, the Leak does not expose fine-tuning controls for the
DAC. However, I've never found these controls to be particularly
useful. It's not that they don't change the sound; rather,
they don't change it in ways that sound 'better' or 'worse'
to my ears. It doesn't bother me that I have fewer pointless
controls to fiddle with.
</p>

<h2>Using a subwoofer</h2>
<p>
I'm using the 130's pre-amplifier output to drive a 
Yamaha subwoofer,
which works fine. The subwoofer has its own gain and cross-over control, 
so it's possible to match it to the main speakers.
</p>
<p>
I use a subwoofer because, in an office environment, I only
have room for small-ish, wall-mount speakers. The subwoofer
lives under my desk. It's easy to turn 
off the subwoofer when other people are around.
</p>
<p>
It takes a bit of fiddling to get the subwoofer matched to the main
speakers, but it's worth it. I'm generally a fan of the small speaker/subwoofer
combination, compared to large, heavy main speakers. The great thing is
that you can put the subwoofer anywhere, within reason -- low frequencies
are not directional. Under the desk, 
I can rest my feet on it.
</p>
<p>
I've seen no evidence that the Stereo 130 can't drive large, floor-standing
speakers successfully; I just don't have any to test it with.
</p>

<h2>CD player capabilities</h2>
<p>
The CD transport has both electrical (coax) and optical
S/PDIF outputs. Either can be used to connect to the
amplifier. I've only used the optical connection, although
there isn't any reason to expect the electrical output 
to sound any different.
</p>
<p>
I'm pleased to report that the CD transport has coped with
even the most tatty, scratched CDs that I've played on it.
I prefer the slot-loading mechanism to a tray, but I appreciate
that this is just a matter of taste. 
</p>
<p>
I'm not a great believer in the notion that
<a href="cdtransport.html">different CD transports 
sound different</a>. My experience -- and the science --
suggests that, with a competent DAC and CDs in good condition, 
there's no musical reason
to prefer one transport over another. I certainly can't 
fault the sound quality of CD playback, 
whatever the musical genre, with headphones or speakers. 
</p>

<h2>Audio file support in the CDT</h2>
<p>
The CD transport has a slot for a USB memory stick, from which
you can play audio files. This is a feature which sounds as if it
might be convenient, but there are many practical problems. 
While the unit will -- to my amazement -- play the
audio soundtracks from video files, it won't play FLAC or
any other lossless compressed format. It will play uncompressed WAV
files, but only if they are CD-like (16 bit, 44.1 kHz). Otherwise, it's 
MP3 -- an odd choice in a unit that makes such a big deal of
its sound quality.
</p>
<p>
Even overlooking the lack of FLAC support, the user interface
is hard to use. A 64 Gb USB stick will hold about a hundred albums
in WAV format. Leak hasn't been clear about the maximum size of
memory stick the CDT will accept, but the manual says that it can
handle about 60,000 files in 700 folders. 
</p>
<p>
In practice, though, it hardly matters, because 
the user interface is impractical with such
a large number of files. There's no way to select a folder except
by clicking through the folder list sequentially using the remote control or
front-panel switches; there is no way to skip a folder, and 
the selection doesn't scroll through any more quickly if you, say,
hold a button down. 
Selecting a folder is particularly arduous if the folder names are
long -- the CDT's display is only 16 characters wide. It will scroll
to display longer names, but this takes a while.
</p>
<p>
Because selecting what to play is a nuisance, it's deeply irritating that,
if I leave the CDT paused for more than a few minutes, the folder selector
and playback restarts to the beginning of the folder list. And "beginning"
itself not very clear -- the folders are not sorted, but displayed
in raw filesystem order. That's probably the order in which you
stored the folders on the USB stick, but that would depend on
the operating system. 
</p>
<p>
This ordering problem affects files as well -- the files within specific
directories are not played in any obvious order. Even if the track
(file) names all begin with a number, there is no sorting.
These ordering problems can be relieved by copying the entire USB stick
from a temporary directory, using a file copier that respects 
alphanumeric order, like <code>rsync</code>. Still, that's not really
a solution because, not only is this very time-consuming with a large
memory stick, there's no way to change the contents of the memory
stick later without breaking the ordering.
</p>
<p>
All in all, the USB stick support is occasionally useful, but it has
too many quirks and limitation to replace a real media player, or
even a smartphone.
</p>

<h2>Headphone output</h2>
<p>
The Stereo 130 has the usual quarter-inch headphone jack
on the front panel. Plugging in headphones switches off
the speakers. 
</p>
<p>
Leak claims that the headphone output is a separate circuit,
not simply derived from the speaker output. Creating a
headphone output by putting a couple of resistors in series
with the speaker output is an egregious error, but it's
frequently
found in low-cost amplifiers. 
</p>
<p>
Leak also claims that the
headphone output is of a similar quality as might be found
in a specialized headphone amplifier of the same cost.
I don't know if this is true, but the headphone output sounds
no better or worse than my Pro-Ject headphone amplifier. 
It will produce ear-splitting volume into any headphone
I own, although I haven't been able to test it with really
high-impedance headphones. 
</p>

<h2>Bluetooth</h2>
<p>
I don't have a lot of use for Bluetooth since, if I want to
play my cellphone through the Stereo 130, I can use the 
USB input. Still, it's useful to have the option to connect
wirelessly from time to time.
</p>
<p>
My Android cellphone paired to the amplifier easily, and
connects in a few seconds. I haven't tested the Bluetooth
range carefully, but it seems no better or worse than other
devices I've used.
</p>
<p>
The Stereo 130 supports Bluetooth aptX which, in ideal 
conditions,
allows for something approaching CD-quality audio. I don't
think there is any support for more modern aptX variants, and
none at all for LDAC -- so bad luck if you own a Sony
phone.  
</p>
<p>
The sound quality of music played over Bluetooth from my
phone is fine -- until I compare it with the same content
played over USB, at which point the limitations of Bluetooth audio
become apparent. That's not a fault of the amplifier, just
a recognition that, until recently (maybe), Bluetooth is not a
high-bandwidth audio channel. 
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, the wooden-cased version of the Stereo 130 
doesn't have an
external Bluetooth antenna -- presumably because the
wooden case doesn't act as a Faraday cage as the metal one does. 
</p>

<h2>Phono (vinyl) support</h2>
<p>
The Stereo 130 has an input for moving-magnet phono. For me, 
this is a significant selling point -- there aren't many 
integrated amplifiers on the market that will play both 
asynchronous USB and vinyl.
</p>
<p>
Next to the phono inputs is a solid turntable 
earthing post, which 
I appreciate since my vintage turntable is the
kind that <a href="tt-safety.html">could kill me</a>. 
</p>
<p>
To my ears, the built-in phono pre-amp sounds better, particularly
in the bass, than
the Behringer self-contained pre-amp I've been using until
now; but that's hardly saying much. There is a tiny bit of
hum and noise when the turntable isn't playing, but I doubt
that is the fault of the amplifier -- more likely it's the
wiring in my 50-year-old turntable. The gain of the phono
pre-amp is a good match for the mid-priced Ortofon cartridge
I use in this turntable.
</p>
<p>
If you get the impression that I'm not a vinyl aficionado, you'd
be right -- I play vinyl records solely for the purposes of
nostalgia, so I'm not hugely fussed about how they sound
(although they sound pretty good to me with the Stereo 130 and
my vintage turntable).
</p>

<h2>Heat issues</h2>
<p>
The amplifier gets warm in use, even when driving only headphones.
In fact, it runs warm even when idle. The CD transport gets only
slightly warm, after extended use. I presume that the amplifier
uses a linear power regulator, rather than a switching one, and these
tend to run warm even when not under much load. 
</p>
<p>
To deal with this heating, the amplifier has air grilles in
the top and bottom of the case. The wood-cased model has
cut-outs in the wood to expose these grilles. The rubber feet
of the amplifier raise the cabinet only about 10mm, so
there isn't an unrestricted air path into the cabinet from the
bottom. It's not been a problem in practice, but I wouldn't
want to stand the amplifier on top of anything that generated
significant heat, nor stand anything on top of it. If you're
stacking equipment, I think the amplifier really needs to go
on top.
</p>


<h2>Power management</h2>
<p>
Both the amplifier and the CD transport have a standby
power mode, in which power consumption is claimed to be 
about one watt. If even one watt is too much, there are
physical switches on the backs of the cabinets that switch
the units off completely. Of course, the remote control won't
wake the units up when they are completely switched off. 
</p>
<p>
When the mains power is applied, the units go into standby
mode, not active mode. After pressing the power buttons 
it takes about twenty seconds for both units to come to an
active state, even though their power LEDs brighten immediately.
For both pieces of equipment, this twenty-second period is one
of complete non-responsiveness. Even the input selector
doesn't work. 
</p>
<p>
The amplifier and the CD transport can both be set to go into standby mode
after a set period of inactivity. It isn't clear to me
what constitutes "inactivity" when an analogue input is selected;
however, I haven't noticed it power down during quiet passages
in music. 
</p>
<p>
Although this automatic standby is environmentally conscious, 
I find it a serious nuisance. In particular, the USB DAC is disconnected
from the computer or phone that is playing. What happens then 
depends on the computer or phone and the software running, but 
it's usually inconvenient. 
The automatic standby is configured by a peculiar and fussy sequence
of button presses. It's not so bad for the CDT, because the front
panel display shows what has been set. For the amplifier, you have to
rely on arcane flashes from the power LED.
</p>
<p>
Even if the standby timer on the CDT is extended or disabled, the 
transport still automatically resets if it is left in pause mode
for more than a few minutes. That is, it stops and resets to the 
first track. This behaviour (so far as I know)
can't be configured, and it's a nuisance.
</p>
<p>
My units were both delivered with the automatic standby set for
twenty minutes, despite what the manual says.
</p>
<p>
Both amplifier and CD transport have 12V trigger inputs and
outputs, so they can switch one another on and off. I haven't
used these, so I can't comment on how well they work.
</p>

<h2>General design</h2>
<p>
Both the Leak units show a thoroughly modern internal design. They are
both essential single-board designs, with a little satellite board for
the front panel controls. The rear panel controls are integrated 
directly into the main board. 
</p>
<p>
This design strategy leaks to a tidy layout, and low construction
costs -- but the main board is essentially non-repairable. You could
probably de-solder a power transistor or a large capacitor, if
necessary; but much of the rest of the main board comprises 
surface-mount integrated circuits. This makes the main board -- and
therefore 90% of the unit -- a throw-away item.   
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/leak_130_inside.jpg" width="650px" 
alt="Photo of Leak 130 inside"/>
</p>

<p>
The other potential problem with a single-board design is 
digital signals getting into the analog tracks -- perhaps through the
power rails. To its credit, the Stereo 130 shows absolutely no sign
of this, even when listening on sensitive headphones with the volume
turned to maximum. 
</p>
<p>
The Stereo 130 has a substantial heat sink, although it's not
mounted directly underneath the ventilation grill. The 130's
main board fills almost all the width and depth of the case, which 
suggests that airflow over the board will be limited. I speculate that
this is why the amplifier tends to run a little warm, even when not
working hard, but that's just a guess. 
</p>
<p>
I was pleased to see a number of very large capacitors mounted
right next to the power output stage, and a scattering of less substantial
ones elsewhere. These large capacitors will need to be replaced in about
twenty years' time, if the rest of the unit, and its owner, 
survive that long.
</p>


<h2>Warranty</h2>
<p>
In the UK, Leak offers a three-year warranty on these units. It seems that
some enrollment is required to benefit from this. Of course, if you
bought one of these units new, you have legal rights against the seller if
it proves to be faulty,
regardless of the manufacturer's warranty.
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
Leak's contemporary amplifier and CD transport do benefit,
to some extent, from the cachet of the Leak name, 
along with the recent vogue for retro styling.
</p>
<p>
I'm quite interested in electronic and computing devices of
the 70s and 80s -- mostly just nostalgia, I guess.
However, other than running on electricity, there's
little to connect these new Leak products to the originals -- 
it's purely a matter of brand and styling.  
</p>
<p>
Not that there's anything wrong with the styling -- it's just
a matter of taste. I'd be no more or less likely to buy these
units without the retro styling, or the Leak name. 
</p>
<p>
The fact that these Leak units tend to sell on the basis
of their looks is confirmed, I think, by the fact that 
only the wooden-cased models are routinely available now. 
While I can imagine buying a carefully-restored, wooden-cased
amplifier from the 1970s, I find it hard to understand why
somebody would want an entirely modern device that looks just
like one. But that's just me.
</p>
<p>
Looks aside, the Stereo 130 is a great-sounding, versatile, small
amplifier, that fits nicely on an office shelf. 
There's almost nothing on the market that offers the same
range of features at the price -- or, in fact, at
any price. If I was really, really fussy, and had unlimited
space, I'd assemble a system from separate components, including
the DAC, phono pre-amp, and headphone amplifier. 
Frankly, though, I don't know
how much you'd have to spend on a turntable, before the
phono pre-amp in the Stereo 130 became the limiting factor
in the sound quality. 
</p>
<p>
The same applies to the headphone amplifier -- I've heard better
headphone amplifiers, but only barely, and never in the same
box as an amplifier with a Bluetooth input.
</p>
<p>
The Leak CDT is slightly harder to recommend, however. It 
works and sounds fine, to be sure, but it's expensive, for
what it is. It's functionally and electronically similar to the 
Audiolab 6000CDT, which is nearly &pound;200 cheaper than
the cheaper of the two Leak variants. The Pro-Ject S3 CD
is about the same price as the Audiolab, but only half
the size. The fact is that CD transports aren't expensive and,
unless you buy into the myth that digital sources can sound
different with the same media, there's little reason to
choose one over the other, except size and cost.

In addition, the CDT has a number of irritating quirks and flaws,
which make it less agreeable to use than it should be.
The lack of any kind of file or folder sorting makes the USB
stick support look like an afterthought -- this is the kind of 
behaviour we see in cheap car radios with a USB slot.

The overwhelming reason to choose the Leak CDT, of course 
-- certainly the reason I chose it -- is that it is a perfect
size and style match 
for the Stereo 130, and uses the same 
remote control. It's unlikely, I think, that I would
have bought the CDT to use with any other amplifier.

I wonder if IAG is planning to release a matching Leak tuner?
