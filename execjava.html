<h1>Making a Java JAR file self-executing (on Linux)</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/java_logo.png" 
  alt="Java logo"/>
This article describes a quick-and-dirty way to make a
Java JAR file self-executing on Linux. I can't guarantee
it will work on every flavour of Linux, but it's worked quite
well in my tests. It can probably be adapted to work on
other platforms, although I haven't tried.
</p>
<p>
I should point out from the outset that this article is not
about compiling Java to a native executable. For more information
on that topic, see my article on
<a href="graalvm_native.html">using GraalVM to compile Java to native code</a>. 
If it is practicable to compile to native code, that should probably
be your first choice in most cases. Unfortunately, it isn't
(yet) always possible.
</p>
<p>
In addition, some Linux versions claim to make Java 
JAR files self-executing
automatically -- all you need to do on these platforms is set
the executable flag on the JAR file. However, although I know
this to be possible in principle, I have yet to come across a Linux
installation where it actually works.
</p>
<p>
<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>The method described in this article involves creating a 'broken' JAR file, which the <code>java</code> utility is nonetheless able to process. That's what makes this a dirty solution. I do not know if all Java implementations are this robust. At the end of the article, I describe how it should be possible to implement a 'clean' version of the method I describe here.</blockquote>
</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>
If you're a reasonably experienced Java developer, particular using
Linux, you'll know that you can build an entire Java application into
a single executable JAR file. It's just a matter of packing all
the compiled class files, along with some meta-data, into a Zipfile,
and calling it 'something.jar'. Then you can execute the 
self-contained JAR at the prompt like this:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
$ java -jar /path/to/my_app.jar [options...]
</pre>
<p>
That's fine, so long as you can find (and remember)  
a suitable location to install the JAR, and you don't mind typing
the full path every time you want to run it. 
</p>
<p>
For a little added convenience, you could create a shell script
that runs the JAR, and copy it into, say, <code>/usr/bin</code>.
In this example, the script would look something like this:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
#!/bin/bash
java -jar /path/to/my_app.jar "$@" 
</pre>
<p>
The <code>$@</code> token indicates to <code>bash</code> to pass any
command-line arguments it received, apart from argument zero, straight
through to the <code>java</code> command line. Your Java application
might not take any arguments but, if it does, your script needs to
handle that.
</p>
<p>
Wouldn't it be easier if we could just simply copy the JAR file
to <code>/usr/bin/</code> and call it <code>my_app</code>, or whatever
name is suitable?
</p>

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>
The way to make the JAR self-executing is to prepend a variant of
the script described above to the JAR file itself. Specifically,
here is the script: 
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
#!/bin/bash
# Prepend this script to a JAR to make it self-executing
# Don't forget to 'chmod 755'. The "java" command must 
#  be working
me=`realpath $0`
exec java -jar $me "$@"

</pre>
<p>
Call this script <code>header</code>, for example.
Now concatenate this script with the Java JAR file:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
$ cat header my_app.jar > my_app
</pre>
<p>
and make it executable:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
$ chmod 755 my_app
</pre>

<p>
Now you should be able to run the application just by running
<code>my_app</code>, and you can copy this file (preserving the
executable attribute, of course) to <code>/usr/bin</code> or
some other location on the <code>$PATH</code>.
</p>

<h2>How does this work?</h2>
<p>
This rather strange procedure works because a JAR file, like
any Zipfile, is
indexed at the end, not the beginning. The final index 
entry, called the 'end of
central directory' record, will always be in the last 64 kilobytes
of the Zipfile. This record has a unique 32-bit signature, and the 
unzipping utility (the Java runtime, in this case) searches for the 
signature in that last 64 kilobytes. Within the end of central
directory record is the offset of the <i>first</i>
central directory record. However, this record also has a unique
signature, so it can be found without knowing the location of the
end of central directory record. The difference between the
position of the first central directory record as determined by
its signature, and its position as indicated by the end of 
central directory record, indicates the amount of additional 
material there is at the start of the file. A robust unzipper will skip
this material. 
</p>
<p>
So the Java runtime can deal with the fact that there is a script
prepended to the JAR file, but we still have to invoke the Java
runtime itself. That's what the script does -- it invokes the
<code>java -jar</code> on <i>itself</i>. 
</p>
<p>
The script invokes <code>java</code> using <code>exec</code>.
This saves memory because the script+JAR assembly does not have
to be kept around until the <code>java</code> command completes,
and also prevents <code>bash</code> trying to run the
JAR as if it was part of a script.
</p>
<p>
</p>
To be fair, although the procedure I've described does work on
every Linux system I've tried, it relies on undocumented
behaviour of the Java runtime, so it should be used with caution.
</p>

<h2>Improving the method</h2>
<p>
The way to clean up the method I've described is to scan
the JAR file to find the start of the central directory,
then iterate through the central directory, correcting
each entry by adding the size of the header to the 
address of the entry's <i>local</i> directory. Effectively
you'd be patching the Zipfile so all the offsets to data are
correct, giving the header at the start of the file.
This shouldn't
be difficult to do, if you understand the format of a Zipfile,
but so far I've found the quick-and-dirty method to work well
enough.
