<h1>Java as a scripting language: new auto-compilation features in Java 11</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/java_logo.png" 
  alt="Java logo"/>
Java is traditionally a compiled language, although the output of the compiler
is not "machine code" in the conventional sense. Separate tools are needed to
compile the Java source and to execute the compiled output. 
Languages like Perl and 
Python, on the other hand, are traditionally interpreted -- executing the
program is a single-step operation that takes source code as its input.
Many Linux/Unix shells, like <code>bash</code>, offer fairly sophisticated
programming features in their own right: the choice whether to
use <code>bash</code> or Perl for a task can sometimes be a coin-tossing one.
</p>
<p>
Programming languages that support one-step execution are often
referred to as "scripting languages", although that's a pretty 
vague term. 
</p>
<p>
Developers and system administrators have typically turned to scripting
language for implementing quick (and sometimes dirty) utilities for
simple, highly-specific tasks. The lack of a separate compilation operation
makes it easy to debug and revise script code, and scripting languages
usually have an accessible syntax. 
</p>
<p>
Since Java 11, it has become possible to use
Java in a very similar way to scripting languages. This new feature is
particularly interesting if you want to  
use Java to write command-line utilities. So, while the basic principle
I'm describing here does apply, to some extent, 
to Microsoft Windows, I would expect it to 
be of most interest to Linux/Unix developers and administrators.
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>When I use the term "Java script" -- which I'm reluctant to do -- I'm referring to Java scripting using the new auto-compile features in Java 11.

<h2>Scripting in Java</h2>
<p>
Consider the old chestnut "Hello, World" program in Java:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#0000FF">public</font></b> <b><font color="#0000FF">class</font></b> <font color="#008080">Test</font>
  <font color="#FF0000">{</font>
  <b><font color="#0000FF">public</font></b> <b><font color="#0000FF">static</font></b> <font color="#009900">void</font> <b><font color="#000000">main</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>String<font color="#990000">[]</font> args<font color="#990000">)</font>
    <font color="#FF0000">{</font>
    System<font color="#990000">.</font>out<font color="#990000">.</font><b><font color="#000000">println</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#FF0000">"Hello, World"</font><font color="#990000">);</font>
    <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
  <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
</pre>

<p>
Traditionally the compilation and execution would be specific steps,
like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">$  javac T1<font color="#990000">.</font>java
$  java T1
Hello<font color="#990000">,</font> World
</pre>

<p>
In this mode of operation, <code>javac</code> produces one or more
<code>.class</code> files, which contain the compiled code. 
<code>java</code> executes the compiled code, starting at a method
called <code>main()</code> in the class <code>T1</code>. 
The <code>java</code> command does not take a filename as its input --
it takes a class name, and finds the corresponding <code>.class</code> file
using class searching rules.
</p>

<p>
Since the implementation of 
<a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/330" target="_blank">JEP330</a>
in JDK 11, it has become possible to run this simple Java program in 
a single step, like this:
</p>


<pre class="codeblock">$ java T1<font color="#990000">.</font>java
Hello<font color="#990000">,</font> World
</pre>

<p>
In this mode of operation, no <code>.class</code> files are produced, and
the compilation and execution steps are quietly combined. Running a Java
program this way is very similar to running a Perl script, by entering:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">$  perl my_script<font color="#990000">.</font>pl 
</pre>

<p>
In fact, there a more similarities than this one-step execution, as we shall see.
</p>

<h2>What else can we do?</h2>

<p>
One of the most striking things about this new feature is that 
<i>regular Java class naming conventions are bypassed</i>.
What I mean by this is that, while traditional Java usage requires a
public class to have the same name as the file that contains it, 
auto-compilation bypasses that requirement.
In my previous example, I defined the class
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#0000FF">public</font></b> <b><font color="#0000FF">class</font></b> <font color="#008080">Test</font>
</pre>

<p>
but I could have called it <code>Fred</code> or <code>myclass</code>, or
anything I liked; I can still execute it using the 
filename <code>Test.java</code>. I can even define the class to be
in a particular package, and execute it without using the package name
(although I'm not sure why I would).
</p>
<p>
The rules for auto-compilation state that the execution begins with the
first class defined in the file, at the <code>main</code> method.
</p>
<p>
Since the implementation refers to the "first" class, you might wonder if
that means you can use multiple classes in the same file and, as it turns
out, you can. So you can implement a full, object-oriented program, so
long as it fits into one source file. This ability to handle multiple classes
opens up the possibility of doing "real" scripting in Java, of the same
kind we might otherwise do with Perl or Python.
</p>
<p>
The "script" we execute need not have a name that ends in <code>.java</code>;
in fact, there are good reasons not to name files this way. If it doesn't,
you can use the <code>--source</code> script to force the <code>java</code>
utility to interpret the file as source code. So, for example, if I
name my file <code>test.jsh</code>, I can execute it as
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">$  java --source <font color="#993399">11</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">test</font></b><font color="#990000">.</font>jsh 
</pre>
<p>
If you're used to writing Perl or Python scripts for Linux, you might be
familiar with invoking the script at the prompt just by its filename, without
specifying the particular language interpreter. Can we do this with
Java? Amazingly, yes we can.
</p>

<h2>Shebangs</h2>

<p>
Unix-like shells (and sometimes kernels) provide ways to have an interpreter
launched, based on a specification in the file. For example, I could
write a Perl script like this, in a file called <code>my_script</code>:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><i><font color="#9A1900">#!/usr/bin/perl</font></i>
<b><font color="#0000FF">print</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#FF0000">"Hello, World\n"</font><font color="#990000">);</font>
</pre>

<p>
Then I can run it at a shell prompt like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">$ <font color="#990000">.</font>/my_script 
</pre>

<p>
without needing to specify the interpreter <code>perl</code> in the command.
Nearly always, I'll need to set the execute permission on the file first:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">$ chmod <font color="#993399">755</font> my_script 
</pre>

<p>
This mode of operation works because of a collaboration between the shell,
perl, and the kernel's program loader. Essentially, <code>perl</code> has to
know to avoid interpreting the first line of the script, which is
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><i><font color="#9A1900">#!/usr/bin/perl</font></i>
</pre>

<p>
and the program loader needs to read this line (and only this line) and invoke 
<code>perl</code>. This first line is colloquially know as a 
"shebang". Since many scripting languages use "#" to introduce
a comment, the first requirement, ignoring the shebang line, is
easy to implement -- at least in <code>bash</code> and Perl. It's
more of a problem for Java -- but not an insurmountable one.
</p>

<p>
Here's a self-executing Java script. We could call the file <code>test</code>,
or <code>test.jsh</code> or, in fact, anything that does not end in
<code>.java</code>. 
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">#<font color="#990000">!</font>java <font color="#990000">--</font>source <font color="#993399">11</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">public</font></b> <b><font color="#0000FF">class</font></b> <font color="#008080">Test</font>
  <font color="#FF0000">{</font>
  <b><font color="#0000FF">public</font></b> <b><font color="#0000FF">static</font></b> <font color="#009900">void</font> <b><font color="#000000">main</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>String<font color="#990000">[]</font> args<font color="#990000">)</font>
    <font color="#FF0000">{</font>
    System<font color="#990000">.</font>out<font color="#990000">.</font><b><font color="#000000">println</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#FF0000">"Hello, World"</font><font color="#990000">);</font>
    <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
  <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
</pre>

<p>
Then we can run it like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">$ <font color="#990000">.</font>/test
Hello<font color="#990000">,</font> World
</pre>

<p>
Note that the (invisible) Java compilation has ignored the shebang
line, even though Java does not use a "#" to introduce comments.
It is for this reason, I think, that the compiler won't allow
a shebang line in a file named <code>.java</code> -- it completely
violates the Java compiler's regular syntax rules about comments.
This is a highly specific feature, introduced into Java to 
support scripting operation.
</p>


<h2>So what's going on?</h2>

<p>
It's important to understand that the new auto-compile feature does
not change how Java works -- it's still a two-step process. Code is
still compiled, following all the usual rules (apart from those applying
to comments, as explained above). When the source has been compiled,
the JVM's run-time engine is turned loose on the compiled code, exactly
as before. All JVM subsystems, including the garbage collector, work
as they always have.
</p>
<p>
There is therefore no gain in speed or memory efficiency from using
Java in script mode. In fact, memory usage might be slightly increased, 
because the
compiled code has to be held in memory for the whole duration of the program.
Compared to the JVM itself, this contribution to memory usage is likely
to be nugatory. However, repeatedly running the "script" incurs the
compilation time overhead on every execution. 
</p>
<p>
On my desktop system, the compilation processes takes about half a
second, for a "script" of a few hundred lines of Java. That's not
long if I only run it once. If I run it repeatedly -- perhaps in another
script -- those half-second delays soon add up. In comparison, a similar
script in Perl takes about 50 msec to start execution. 
</p>
<p>
This isn't a surprise -- Perl is a language that was always designed
to operate in a scripting, interpreted mode; Java is not. And, once
compilation is over, the Java implementation may well out-perform the
Perl version -- it really depends on the specific operations.
</p>

<h2>So is this <i>real</i> scripting?</h2>
<p>
That the new auto-compilation feature supports shebang lines -- 
and thus the ability
for programs to be executed easily at the prompt -- does suggest that
the implementers of the new feature were aiming at full-scale
scripting. However, JEP330 expressly distances itself from this kind
of speculation:
</p>

<blockquote>
"...it is not a goal to evolve the Java language into a general 
purpose scripting language."
</blockquote>

<p>
It is right to take this stance because, for better or worse, Java does not
really have any of the features that make Perl and <code>bash</code> so
successful for scripting.
</p>

<p>
Both these utilities (and Python to a lesser extent) were designed to
form a kind of plumbing around command-line utilities. Consider, for example,
the following Perl script:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#0000FF">my</font></b> <font color="#009900">@df</font> <font color="#990000">=</font> `df <font color="#990000">-</font>h`<font color="#990000">;</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">chomp</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#009900">@df</font><font color="#990000">);</font> <i><font color="#9A1900"># Remove end-of-line marks</font></i>

<b><font color="#0000FF">foreach</font></b> <b><font color="#0000FF">my</font></b> <font color="#009900">$line</font> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#009900">@df</font><font color="#990000">)</font>
  <font color="#FF0000">{</font>
  <b><font color="#0000FF">if</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#009900">$line</font> <font color="#990000">!~</font> <font color="#FF0000">/^Filesystem/</font><font color="#990000">)</font> <i><font color="#9A1900"># Remove header line</font></i>
    <font color="#FF0000">{</font>
    <b><font color="#0000FF">print</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#FF0000">"$line\n"</font><font color="#990000">);</font>
    <i><font color="#9A1900">#...</font></i>
    <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
 <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
</pre>

<p>
This script is intended to do something (doesn't matter what) to mounted 
filesystems, based on their size. It starts by executing the command-line
utility <code>df -h</code>, and assigning its output line-by-line 
to an array of
strings. Then it removes all end-of-line marks from the array
using <code>chomp()</code>.
Then it iterates the array, using a regular expression match to 
ignore the header line in the output from <code>df</code>.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this script is unimportant -- what I'm trying to illustrate
is how difficult it would be to implement these ten lines of Perl
in Java. You'd have to use <code>Runtime.exec()</code> to execute
<code>df</code>, and set up multiple threads to consume the 
<code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> streams from its execution.
Then you'd have to parse the output, removing end-of-line markers
in your own code. You'd have to create a <code>Vector&lt;String&gt;</code> or
similar to hold the specific lines as you parse them. You'd need to 
use the Java regular expression support to remove the unwanted
lines. Oh, and you'd need to deal with character set conversion in 
some way, because the platform's character set probably won't match
the JVM's internal string format. 
</p>
<p>
In Perl or Python I can define modules -- separate program files --
that are themselves defined in Perl or Python. I don't need to compile
or link them. There's no comparable way for a self-compiling
Java source file to run another Java source file -- except by invoking
the compiler explicitly. 
</p>
<p>
The fact is that real scripting languages are good at this kind of 
thing -- they're good at (a) working with the platform, and (b) assembling
a complex program from modules written in the same scripting language. 
A self-compiling Java script <i>can</i> run additional Java modules --
but they have to be compiled first. If the application allows for 
compiling <i>some</i> Java, there seems to be little to gain by 
not compiling <i>all</i> Java.
</p>
<p>
It's no accident that Perl is regularly voted the most hated programming
language by developers, but there's no doubt that it's very good at the
kinds of things it was designed to do.
</p>
<p>
In principle, where the new auto-compilation feature could be useful is
in education. Auto-compilation makes Java quite access to experiment 
with -- but not as accessible as Python, because the student still
has to content with the Java boilerplate.  
</p>
<p>
Moreover, beyond primary education, is it too much to ask, that a
potential programmer should know what a compiler does? Is typing
<code>javac</code> followed by <code>java</code> really all that much
less comprehensible than just typing <code>java</code>?
</p>
<p>
For all that, I can see a role for auto-compilation in an educational
setting. I don't really see Java replacing Perl for one-off system
administration tasks, and that doesn't seem to be the focus of the
new features. These features are interesting, and time will tell whether
they prove to be useful.
