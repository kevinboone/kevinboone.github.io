<h1>Using the Qpid Proton C++ library to create a server for monitoring or telemetry data</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/antenna.png" 
  alt="Antenna logo"/>
Interfacing to sensors, or collecting low-level system health information,
is a job that is often best done in C/C++. This kind of data collection
is often platform-dependent, even when the data is exposed in a 
reasonably useable way (e.g., <code>/dev/XXX</code> devices on Linux).
</p>
<p>
However, we might want to make use of data like this using a different
programming language, on a different host system from the one where
it was collected. In a telemetry system, in fact, there could be
hundreds of nodes collecting data, and a small number of places
where the data is collected and aggregated. 
</p>
<p>
A common way to handle requirements of this kind -- one that I have
used myself many times -- is to run a message broker
somewhere in the network. Data collection nodes would read data
using whatever programming language is most suitable, and publish
that data to the broker. Data analysis nodes would subscribe to the
broker, and process the incoming data as they see fit. Modern
message brokers can handle many different wire protocols, but they
tend to be large, complex applications. Alternatively,
<a href="https://mosquitto.org/">Mosquitto</a> is a good example
of a lightweight MQTT message broker. It can even be
<a href="mosquitto-openshift.html">run in an OpenShift cloud</a>
if needed. Mosquitto, however, supports only the MQTT protocol.
</p>

<p>
In this article I present an alternative method of data collection and
distribution, that avoids the use of the message broker completely.
In this approach, each telemetry node collects data, and makes it
available using the AMQP messaging protocol. AMQP is widely-supported --
there are libraries for Java, C, C++, Python, Ruby, Go, and probably
others. In effect, each telemetry node runs its own mini-broker, 
as part of the same application that collects the data. Clients
can subscribe to "queues" on that broker, just as they would to
a real broker.
</p>

<p>
The advantages of this approach are the elimination of a central broker,
and wide language support. In addition, AMQP 1.0 is now an international
standard, and is likely to remain stable and well-supported. Adding
what amounts to a message broker to the data collection application
creates surprisingly little overhead, when using the approach 
described here. Of course, you probably won't want to implement your
own AMQP message broker from scratch -- what's needed is a software
library that will allow us to do that. 
</p>
<p>
In this article, I'm mostly concerned with Linux (perhaps embedded Linux).
However, all the software used does run under Windows (but please don't
ask me how).
</p>

<h2>About Qpid Proton</h2>

<p>
<a href="https://qpid.apache.org/proton" 
  target="_blank">Apache Qpid Proton</a> is a library in C and C++
for managing AMQP 1.0 messaging connections. It also has bindings for
Ruby and Python, making it relatively easy to program AMQP applications
in those languages. Using Proton does not require much knowledge of
AMQP, although some is helpful. 
</p>
<p>
Although Proton can be used to code clients of message brokers, it's
equally applicable to creating servers. In fact, coding a client
and coding a server are substantially similar. If you're used to
programming in JMS, Proton might come as a shock, as it has very
little conceptual overlap with the JMS system. 
</p>

<h2>Getting Qpid Proton</h2>

<p>
Proton is available in the repositories of most popular Linux distributions.
For Ubuntu-like systems:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ sudo apt-get install libqpid-proton-cpp12-dev
</pre>
<p>
On Fedora/RHEL, use:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
$ sudo dnf install qpid-proton-cpp-devel
</pre>

<p>
This is sufficient for C/C++ programming (although, of course, you'll
need a suitable compiler). You might also install bindings for other
programming languages, for example:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
$ sudo dnf install python3-qpid-proton 
</pre>
<p>
You can also build Proton from source, which isn't particularly difficult.
If you do build from source, you'll get more control over which features
are included, which might be important if your building for an embedded
system.
</p>

<h2>The example</h2>
<p>
My example is a utility called <code>amqp-monitor</code>. All it does
is broadcast an alert when the load average of the host system
exceeds a certain threshold. Of course, this isn't a hugely useful
application -- it's just an example of the kind of thing that can be
done.
</p>

<p>
I'm not going to describe the source code of the example here. It is
available from
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/amqp-monitor">my GitHub repository</a>,
including a reasonably detailed description of how the program
works, and how it uses Proton.
</p>

<h2>Running the data collection server</h2>
<p>
On the machine from which data is to be collected, run the server
process like this:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
$ amqp-monitor --cpu-load 20 --port 5672
</pre>

<p>
The server will listen for incoming AMQP connections from data collection
clients on (in this case) port 5672. Any number of clients can
connect at the same time, and receive the same information. 
The server distributes its messages on a queue called "load", so this
is what clients should connect to. It also distributes a timer tick on
the queue called "tick", so that clients can test that they are connected
properly.
</p>

<h2>Running the clients</h2>
<p>
Any client that can do AMQP can connect to the server on port 5672
(or whatever is selected), and subscribe to the queue called "load".
Here's how to test this using my 
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/amqutil">Java test client, amqutil</a>:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ amqutil subscribe --qpid --destination load --format text \
    --host [my server] --port 5672
</pre>

<p>
For the record, the switch <code>--qpid</code> selects the use of the
Qpid JMS library, for communicating using AMQP.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, here is a code example in Python, which uses the 
Qpid Proton Python library for AMQP support:

</pre>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
Running a message broker as a central place to collect and distribute
telemetry or monitoring data is a widely-used practice, but it isn't
the only way to handle such data. Embedding an AMQP server into the
applications that collect data eliminates the need for a central
broker, while still allowing the use of the widely-support AMQP
messaging protocol. 
</p>

<p>
Coding clients that collect the data is exactly the same, using this
approach, as it would be with a central broker -- the clients just
connect directly to the data collection nodes.
