id="battle-of-the-privacy-focused-search-engines-kagi-vs.-duckduckgo">Battle
of the privacy-focused search engines: Kagi vs. DuckDuckGo</h1>
<p><img src="img/degoogle.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>Google’s search engine currently handles over 90% of the world’s web
searches. Microsoft’s Bing handles about 3%. A bunch of comparatively
niche search engines fight over the remaining 7%.</p>
<p>A problem with Google’s search, and Microsoft’s to a lesser extent,
is that these companies use tracking technology to record your entire
search history. They use that information to supply their colossal
advertising infrastructure. Many people don’t want their browsing
history recorded and, even if you don’t worry about this, you might not
want to contribute to turning the whole web into an advertising
banner.</p>
<p>Consequently, we need a search engine that respects our privacy – one
that doesn’t associate search requests with a user, nor share user
profiles with advertisers. This article is about two such search
engines: DuckDuckGo and Kagi. A relative newcomer, Brave, also merits
consideration, but that’s a job for another day.</p>
<h2 id="funding-and-subscription">Funding and subscription</h2>
<p>Running a search engine is expensive – colossally expensive, if you
do the whole job yourself. We know how Google and Microsoft fund their
search engines: by monetizing users’ personal information. What about
search services that don’t do that?</p>
<p>Kagi’s funding model is easy to understand: it’s a paid, subscription
service. It doesn’t rely on advertising in any way, only on the fees its
users pay.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo, however, is free to use because it’s supported by
advertising. It isn’t <em>targeted</em> advertising <em>a la</em>
Google, but it’s still advertising. DDG’s advertising is driven entirely
by the search query, not the user’s history (which DDG does not store).
So, for example, if you search for “Volkswagen Polo” you might see links
to sites that sell these cars, but you shouldn’t see advertisements for
things you saw in your browser yesterday.</p>
<p>Presenting sponsored links in search results can be irritating but,
if you’re in the market for a new car, it might be useful. If you click
a sponsored link, DDG gets a tiny financial reward from the advertiser.
Is it enough to fund the service? It seems to be: DDG has been
profitable for at least ten years. At one point it received commercial
sponsorship from companies that wanted to provide their staff with a
non-advertising web search; I haven’t been able to find out whether this
is still the case.</p>
<p>DDG allows users to turn off even its own non-targeted advertising
links. In practice, I find that I don’t see a lot of ads with DDG, even
when I leave advertising turned on. This might be because I don’t search
for things that people sell; but DDG advertising seems to be pretty
non-intrusive, by all accounts.</p>
<p>Kagi’s basic subscription costs $54 per year, which allows for up to
3600 searches. Since I sometimes make more searches than that in a
<em>month</em>, I need the more expensive “professional” service, at
$108 per year. This level of service also provides access to Kagi’s
translation services, which I’ve found to be quite good. There’s an even
more expensive service tier that includes additional, premium AI
support. As yet, I’ve not found much use for AI-based search, but I
appreciate that some people like this.</p>
<p>When I was a working man, I wouldn’t have hesitated a moment to
subscribe to Kagi for $108 per year. Now I’m retired, it’s an outlay
that I had to think hard about. You really have to be sure that Kagi
offers better search results than DDG, to pay even this modest amount.
Fortunately, Kagi offers a free trial, so you can find out.</p>
<p>While DDG is free to use, it does have a subscription tier, which
provides a VPN, and extended AI support. I haven’t used it, so I don’t
know if it represents good value at $99 per year.</p>
<p>It seems to me that both DDG and Kagi balance on a financial
tightrope. They both serve a comparatively niche market, and small
changes to their user base could have profound operational consequences.
Still, both are hanging in there, and seem to be doing reasonably
well.</p>
<p>Kagi’s subscription model requires the user to authenticate, which is
a potential source of problems that I’ll discuss later.</p>
<p>In the baldest financial terms, DDG wins over Kagi because it’s free
of charge. Kagi isn’t terribly expensive, but free is a tough price to
beat.</p>
<h2 id="privacy-issues">Privacy issues</h2>
<p>DuckDuckGo’s privacy model is very simple: it doesn’t record anything
about user interaction except a settings cookie. Removing this cookie
will lose any custom settings you’ve made, but it won’t stop the search
engine working. Unless you’ve made significant custom settings, it won’t
be a problem if you configure your browser to dump all cookies
periodically. DDG doesn’t save any search history, or bias the search
results according to previous user behaviour. It’s pretty much as
private as a search engine can possibly be.</p>
<p>Neither Kagi nor DDG uses search history or user behaviour to bias
the search results, which means that you won’t get the algorithmic
“confirmation bias” you see with Google’s search. Google’s bias can
actually be useful, though, as well as harmful. Kagi compensates for the
statelessness of its user interaction by allowing the user to add
<em>intentional</em> bias, as I’ll explain later.</p>
<p>Kagi follows the same privacy model as DDG to the extent that it can.
However, being a subscription service, it needs to know the user has
paid, so it has to provide a way to authenticate, and to store the
authentication status. It uses a cookie for this, as most websites do.
Dumping the cookie won’t hurt your relationship with Kagi, but you’ll
either have to log in again next time you want to do a search, or find
some other way to maintain a logged in session (more on this later).</p>
<p>Kagi loses slightly to DDG in privacy because of the need to
associate payment details with an account. You’ll need a working email
address, although it can be a burner. Still, if you use a credit card
for payment, Kagi will receive credit card details and be able to match
them to an account, should it wish. This means that Kagi users rely for
privacy on the integrity of Kagi’s staff. I see no reason to doubt Kagi
in this respect but, if you’re not convinced, Kagi takes anonymous
payment using cryptocurrencies and the like.</p>
<p>In short, I don’t really see much to choose between DDG and Kagi on
privacy grounds. With both services, you’re trusting that the companies
will comply with their own privacy policies. However, Kagi handles a
little more personal information than DDG, so breaches of its privacy
policy could be a bit more serious, and it’s slightly more of a viable
target for villainous hackers.</p>
<h2 id="search-performance-and-ranking">Search performance and
ranking</h2>
<p>No search engine is neutral; they all present their results in the
form of a list, so they have to make decisions on ordering. Neither DDG
nor Kagi operate completely independently of other search services (more
on this later), so there will always be some inherent pre-selection of
results. However, DDG and Kagi also apply their own rankings.</p>
<p>Users judge the effectiveness of a search engine by how well it
delivers relevant content. The challenge for the search provider is to
work out how to do that. All the major search engines, including
Google’s, say they up-rank sites that contain “genuine content”, and not
just click-bait and AI slop. DuckDuckGo got into trouble in 2022, when
it was seen to down-rank sites that it deemed to contain
“misinformation”, but some users welcomed this move. Today DDG’s
approach is to down-rank sites that exhibit “low journalistic standards”
which it assesses in a number of ways. I presume that deliberate
disinformation remains an indicator of poor journalism.</p>
<p>Kagi favours sites that limit advertising and tracking; this, again,
is something that many users welcome, but others see as a kind of
censorship. It also down-ranks sites that appear to be AI-generated.
Kagi consistently includes more hits from my own site than other search
engines do, so it must be measuring quality properly ;) Ahem.</p>
<p>It’s almost impossible to rate search engines on effectiveness, other
than on entirely subjective grounds. I’d like to give just one example
which is, of course, not at all representative. I’ve been having trouble
with the fit of my rucksack when hiking, and I did a web search for
“adjust rucksack”. For the sake of comparison, I used DDG, Kagi, and
Google.</p>
<p>All three engines returned what I consider to be useful results.
Google, as you might expect, filled at least 60% of each page with links
to sites that <em>sold</em> rucksacks, which wasn’t at all what I
wanted. Still, I found useful results in the first three pages, when I’d
mentally filtered out all the shopping links.</p>
<p>Kagi and DDG both returned the same links as one another in the first
two pages, with no links to shopping sites. What I considered to be the
most useful link for my purposes was the first one Kagi showed; that
same link was somewhat lower down in the results from DDG, but it was
there.</p>
<p>I’ve found this to be broadly true of most searches: for <em>my</em>
purposes, Kagi usually puts the links I find most useful a little higher
up the result list. Still, I’ve generally found that Kagi and DDG show
the same links in the first two pages – unless I apply a <em>lens</em>
in Kagi.</p>
<p>To my mind, lenses are one of Kagi’s most useful features. You can
deliberately bias the search results according to location, date,
keywords, and other things. You can then name this group of bias
settings, and apply the same bias to any search. So, for example, I have
a “Recent UK” lens, that emphasises results from the UK in the last
week. There are also built-in lenses that favour forum posts, news
sites, and other things.</p>
<p>I can filter results by criteria in DDG, but I can’t group the
settings and name them for future use. If you use custom search biases –
and I do, all the time – Kagi is more convenient than DDG.</p>
<p>Kagi’s lens settings are stored as part of the user’s account. If
you’re a hard-core privacy enthusiast, you might balk at Kagi storing
even this small amount of personal information; but if you did, I think
you’d be losing one of Kagi’s most useful features.</p>
<h2 id="ai-assistance">AI assistance</h2>
<p>Both DuckDuckGo and Kagi provide “AI” assistance. You can type
questions in natural language, and get answers from a bunch of
commercial LLMs. In a sense, the search engines act as anonymizing
proxies for the LLM providers. You’ll find all the usual suspects:
ChatGPT, Gemini, and so on. To use the latest and best LLMs in either
DDG or Kagi you’ll need a specific subscription.</p>
<p>Kagi’s “Quick” model answers most questions in under five seconds.
Anything beyond that can take significant time. In my tests, waiting
longer didn’t elicit noticeably better answers, but I guess this depends
on the question.</p>
<p>I’m not an expert on the use of LLMs, and I’m definitely not a fan.
The DDG and Kagi AI assistants both output reasonably well-written,
apposite text. However – at least with the standard LLMs in the base
subscription – none of the available models could answer questions that
required significant research. If I want general information with
reasonable veracity about common subjects, I can get it from Wikipedia
easily enough. Hard questions remain hard, with LLM support or without
it.</p>
<p>I’m sure there’s a market for these “AI” tools, but I don’t think I’m
part of it, so it’s hard for me to comment on which of DDG or Kagi
performs better in this area.</p>
<h2 id="search-sources">Search sources</h2>
<p>Let’s address the elephant in the sitting-room.</p>
<p>There’s only a handful of companies in the world with the resources
to maintain a full index of the whole world-wide web. In the English
language there’s really only Microsoft, Google, and Yandex. Yandex is
problematic for a host of reasons, including its connection to the
Russian state. DuckDuckGo and Kagi maintain a partial index, as does the
newer Brave search engine.</p>
<p>Over time these indexes will undoubtedly expand, but it’s worth
keeping in mind that it took Microsoft, with all its colossal resources,
nearly twenty years to develop a search index that can begin to compete
with Google’s.</p>
<p>This means that most most English-language search services use
Microsoft and Google as back-ends for general searches, and perhaps
Yandex.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean they’re limited to these sources, of course.
DuckDuckGo says that it uses 400 different information sources,
including Wikipedia, TripAdvisor, and Wolfram Alpha. Kagi also uses
multiple information sources, not very different to DDG’s.</p>
<p>However, these sources are for specialist queries. For general
search, DDG relies primarily on Microsoft’s Bing. At one time Kagi
documented the search sources it used but, after a spate of complaints
about some of its choices, Kagi now says only that…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our search results also include anonymized API calls to all major
search result providers worldwide, specialized search engines like
Marginalia, and sources of vertical information such as Wolfram Alpha,
Apple, Wikipedia…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not clear what “all major search result providers” amounts to,
but I’d be surprised if it didn’t include Microsoft or Google, or
both.</p>
<p>DDG and Kagi both anonymize the searches they make on other
providers, so I don’t think we need to be concerned that using Google,
et al., as back-ends creates a privacy hazard. However there’s no
getting away from the fact that <em>using either DDG or Kagi amounts to
funding the tech giants</em>.</p>
<p>I wish it were not so, and I can only hope that, over time,
independent search providers will develop their own indexing
infrastructure that rivals those of Microsoft and Google. I doubt that
will happen this year, and probably not this decade.</p>
<h2 id="translation-summarizing-and-proof-reading">Translation,
summarizing, and proof-reading</h2>
<p>These services are not directly related to web search but, since the
search developers are already invested in LLM technology, I guess they
can readily use the same expertise to provide these supplementary
services, all of which rely on LLMs.</p>
<p>So far as I know, DuckDuckGo does not offer any of these services.
Kagi’s translation service seems to be at least as good as Google’s,
inasmuch as I am able to judge. I tried some passages of classical and
medieval Latin, which I’d been working on translating myself. Both Kagi
and Google made a good job of the (medieval) Venerable Bede, producing
readable English. Both stuggled with Virgil’s (classical) Aeneid, but
that’s hardly surprising: Virgil’s highly-stylized poetry poses a
challenge to human translators, too. I tried translating some of my
website articles into French and German, with which I have some passing
familiarity, and the results seemed good enough.</p>
<p>I believe that Kagi’s translation service is home-grown, based on
several commercial LLMs. I don’t have any more information about how it
works than that. It isn’t just acting as a proxy for Google Translate,
because it doesn’t produce the same output.</p>
<p>Kagi’s summarizer will work with blocks of text, or whole web pages.
I found it to be astonishingly good, when fed with competently-written
text. To be honest, it’s not a tool I have much need for, but it’s
impressive, nonetheless.</p>
<p>The proof-reading service is also impressive, although I found its
suggested changes to my own writing to be slightly stuffy. Again, I
don’t really use this kind of tool, but perhaps I should.</p>
<h2 id="authentication-issues">Authentication issues</h2>
<p>Unless you’ve subscribed to get the more advanced AI support, DDG is
free to use, and doesn’t require authentication. Kagi does, and this is
a slight cause of irritation.</p>
<p>Kagi’s authentication status is stored in a long-lived cookie so,
provided you allow your browser to retain such cookies, you’ll stay
logged in.</p>
<p>Those of us who are really fussy about privacy, however, configure
our browsers to dump cookies periodically. Doing this to Kagi’s cookie
will log you out. If you want to stay logged in, you’ll need to tell
your browser to exempt Kagi’s cookie from deletion.</p>
<p>This isn’t a big deal, really, except that I have to do it on every
web browser on every device I use.</p>
<p>An alternative approach to maintaining authentication is to configure
your browser to use Kagi with a <em>session link</em>: a random numeric
parameter to add to the Kagi search URL, that automatically logs you in.
This configuration is significantly more fiddly than simply telling the
browser to keep Kagi’s cookie but, of course, the browser doesn’t need
to store a cookie. In practice I use a combination of these (cookie and
session link) techniques.</p>
<p>I see no way to avoid the minor inconvenience of authentication, if
you’re using a subscription service. I presume the same problems would
be present if you used DuckDuckGo with a subscription. Of course, for
most purposes, you <em>don’t</em> need a subscription for DDG, and the
problems of authentication don’t arise.</p>
<h2 id="small-web-support">“Small web” support</h2>
<p>The “small web” is that (ever-diminishing) portion of the world-wide
web not dominated by advertising and commercial interests. It consists
of websites (like this one) maintained by individuals and based on
simple technologies.</p>
<p>Kagi’s search favours results from small web sites, and can be
configured to show <em>only</em> those results.</p>
<p>I use this feature all the time: unless I’m actively shopping for
something, I invariably get more apposite and interesting results from
sites on the small web than from commercial operators.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>DDG and Kagi are both privacy-respecting search engines. Although
you’ll have to pay to use Kagi, you get more than just search for your
money: Kagi offers excellent translation and summarizing services, for
example. Both search services offer AI support, but I’m in no position
to judge between them, because I don’t use them enough.</p>
<p>As much as I admire Kagi’s principles, I don’t find its search
performance hugely superior to DuckDuckGo’s. Kagi is ad-free, but DDG
doesn’t show me a lot of advertising, and I can turn off the little I do
see. Judged subjectively, Kagi puts the most useful results (for me) a
little closer to the top of the results list than DDG does, but both
give me the same results in the first page or two. Named “lenses” are a
killer feature of Kagi for me, along with its bias towards “small web”
sites. I don’t know that I’d subscribe other than for these features, or
unless I used the translation feature every day.</p>
<p>There’s also the minor irritation of needing to authenticate to use
Kagi.</p>
<p>However, part of repudiating ad-tech’s assault on the Internet is
being willing to <em>pay</em> for what you use. Every subscription to
Kagi adds a drop of pure, clean water to the cesspool of poisonous bile
the Internet has become.</p>
