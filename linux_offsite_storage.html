Dropbox, pCloud, and rsync.net for off-site storage for Linux users</h1>
<p><img src="img/tux_disk.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>Long-term data security is the elephant in the sitting room of the IT
industry. We can still read Akkadian stone tablets from nearly four
thousand years ago, but I can’t read documents I stored on DAT tape only
thirty years ago. I have 70,000+ photos and five thousand hours of
video, and that’s just from domestic activities. Of course, I have this
stuff backed up on my home NAS, but what if there’s a fire? Or a
burglary?</p>
<p>I imagine that the problem is even more acute for businesses, which
have legal obligations to store documents for a period of time, quite
apart from a need to protect their creative output. In this article,
though, I focus on the domestic situation, where simplicity and low cost
are primary factors.</p>
<p>I will consider three off-site backup and synchronization services
that have some claim to be Linux-friendly: Dropbox, pCloud, and
rsync.net. By ‘Linux-friendly’ I mean that they either provide specific
software for Linux (Dropbox and pCloud), or use protocols that are
widely used in the Linux world (rsync.net). I’m specifically not
including Google Drive, because it offers no official support for Linux
at all. There are third-party Linux tools that provide some measure of
integration with Google Drive, and Linux users can still use its web
interface. Nevertheless, I’m focusing on services that specifically
target Linux – if only in a half-hearted way – rather than those that
actively repudiate it.</p>
<p>The three services I describe in this article are ones that I have
used extensively, over the last ten years or so. I have most experience
with Dropbox so, if I seem particular hard on that service, it’s
probably because I’ve had longer to get familiar with its faults.</p>
<h2 id="service-overviews">Service overviews</h2>
<p>Dropbox is the grand old man of consumer file sync services. It’s
been around since 2008 and, for Windows users at least, it’s a stable,
well-supported platform. The service has benefited from constant
development, and is now quite sophisticated, offering a huge range of
features beyond basic file sharing and backup. Whether any of those
features are useful to a Linux user is debatable. Almost no experience
is needed, to make effective use of the Dropbox service – even on
Linux.</p>
<p>Dropbox provides a proprietary client which attempts to keep a
single, local directory (typically <code>$HOME/Dropbox</code>) in sync
with the server, and with other computers using the same account.
There’s also a web interface, and a well-documented API for extensions,
which is used by a range of 3rd-party applications. There’s no support
for traditional file transfer protocols like FTP and, if you want to
transfer files <em>without</em> syncing, you’ll need additional,
3rd-party tools (or you can write your own, as I did).</p>
<p>rsync.net is a much more focused service and, although it will work
fine with platforms other than Linux, it’s really intended for people
with significant Linux/Unix experience. rsync.net just provides a Unix
filesystem, accessible over SSH. What you do with it is limited mostly
by your ingenuity. You might choose to synchronize files with the
server, as Dropbox does, or just upload and download using the command
line. rsync.net also has a long history – it’s been around since 2001
although, in my view, it’s only in the last few years that it’s become
(barely) affordable for small-scale users.</p>
<p>pCloud is a relatively new offering, introduced in 2013. It’s a
similar kind of service to the one Dropbox offers, in that it uses a
proprietary client. The client provides both synchronization and
non-synchronized file transfers. Like Dropbox, there’s no support for
traditional protocols like FTP. And, also like Dropbox, pCloud requires
little experience to use, even on Linux. However, pCloud offers a more
flexible synchronization process than Dropbox: you can select abitrary
directories on the local machine to synchronize with any directories on
the server.</p>
<p>In fact, pCloud exposes the entire shared storage as a directory,
typically <code>$HOME/pCloudDrive</code>. This is in addition to its
capabilities for synchronization, and has the benefit that you can use
simple command-line tools to copy files to and from the server. So you
don’t need any additional tools to transfer files <em>without</em>
synchronizing them, which is an advantage over Dropbox, at least for
Linux users.</p>
<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>
<p>It’s almost impossible to compare the costs of these competing
services effectively, because their pricing models are so different. So,
in an attempt to make some kind of comparison, I’m looking at the cost
of 2Tb of storage, paid annually, with no extra features, and a small
number of concurrent users.</p>
<p>For this scenario, Dropbox offers the best value for money, at UK£96
per year. pCloud comes a close second, at UK£100. Trailing the pack, by
a long distance, is rsync.net at US$288 (UK£220 at the current exchange
rate).</p>
<p>If you need less that 2Tb of storage, however, then Dropbox is less
appealing, because it offers nothing smaller. pCloud offers a minimum
500Gb for UK£50, while rsync.net offers its minimum of 800Gb for $103
(UK£78).</p>
<p>Whatever the storage size, rsync.net offers the least value for money
for the basic service. However, there’s not a colossal difference
between the prices of these services, and the prices change almost
daily, according to the market and the current exchange rates. Moreover,
all the services have useful optional features that increase the price.
All have longer-term and lifetime pricing, but it’s hardly worth
comparing these offerings, because their prices change so enormously, so
frequently.</p>
<p>Both pCloud and Dropbox have a completely free tier, offering quite
small storage (typically 5-10Gb). All the services have frequent special
offers. For example, at one time Dropbox provided one year of 2Tb
storage to everybody who bought a Samsung phone. At the time of writing,
buying a one-year subscription to the Private Internet Access VPN gets
you a free year of 500Gb pCloud. It’s worth watching out for these
offers, because they make it easy and cheap to evaluate the services in
realistic usage patterns. Sadly, at this time rsync.net has no free
tier, nor even a free trial.</p>
<h2 id="linux-compatibility">Linux compatibility</h2>
<p>The most important point to note is that if you want an
install-and-forget, background file synchronization method, then
<em>none of these services is</em> <em>satisfactory</em>. rsync.net
won’t be satisfactory because it simply isn’t designed to work that way.
Dropbox and pCloud won’t be satisfactory because they just don’t work
very well on Linux.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
Please note that I’m referring here specifically to unattended,
background synchronization – there are other ways to use all these
services, that work perfectly well. However, both pCloud and Dropbox are
mostly aimed at providing background synchronization services, and the
fact that they don’t work very well on Linux is a mark against both of
them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel I should also point out that the background synchronization
works tolerably well with Dropbox for small amounts of synchronized data
(much less than 10Gb). pCloud doesn’t work very well even with small
amounts of data.</p>
<p>What goes wrong? Here are some things I’ve noticed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Synchronization just stops completely, without warning. I notice
this particularly when resuming a computer from standby, or when
starting and stopping a VPN service. Both Dropbox and pCloud have this
problem, quite often.</li>
<li>Extended periods of 100% CPU usage (both).</li>
<li>Complete failure of synchronization, requiring a full
re-synchronization (both).</li>
<li>Limited Linux filesystem support (Dropbox only supports ext4).</li>
<li>Files being renamed as conflicted (see below) for no obvious reason
(pCloud)</li>
<li>Misleading, unhelpful error messages (pCloud)</li>
</ul>
<p>My attempts to keep hundreds of gigabytes of data in sync using
Dropbox were a complete failure. I found Dropbox often using 30%+ CPU
even when it seemed to be idle, for long periods of time. pCloud
couldn’t even manage 10Gb reliably.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand that background synchronization is a
tricky problem, when multiple client computers are involved. One
particularly nasty situation arises when several clients are editing the
same file at the same time. Both Dropbox and pCloud keep copies of the
affected file, with ‘conflicted’ in the filename. If you’re working on
the same file from multiple computers, it’s not unusual to end up with
many copies of the file on every computer, all with a version number and
‘conflicted’ appended. Working out which is the authoritative copy can
be tricky.</p>
<p>This isn’t a problem that is specific pCloud or Dropbox – it’s a
general problem of distributed file management. However, at the time of
writing, pCloud’s implementation of conflict management is simply buggy.
I’ve noticed that a file I’m editing will sometimes disappear
completely, and be replaced with a new file with a ‘conflicted’ name,
even when <em>no other client is editing it</em>. This is a particular
problem for files that I save often. The pCloud application often emits
error messages about files that could not be synchronized <em>even when
they have been</em>. That’s not a huge problem in itself, but its hard
to trust the error reporting from the pCloud application.</p>
<p>But what about non-synchronized file transfers? By this I mean files
that are transferred to and from the server using specific
administrative actions. Here all the services work fine except that, for
Dropbox, you’ll have to find 3rd-party tools that use the Dropbox API to
do the transfer – nothing is supplied. For rsync.net you can just use
<code>rsync</code>, or any conventional file transfer tool. For pCloud
you can just copy files to and from the <code>pCloudDrive</code> virtual
directory. However, a plain <code>rsync</code> operation is simply much
faster than any of the proprietary transfer methods.</p>
<p>rsync.net offers the best Linux compatibility of the three services,
because it’s so simple. There’s no proprietary client – you’ll just be
using tools that have existed in Linux for decades. In addition, the
rsync.net technical staff actually understand Linux, which is a huge
advantage over the competition. For both Dropbox and pCloud it’s hard to
talk to anybody who knows anything at all about Linux, and it’s clear
that Linux support is not a priority. For example, the pCloud Linux
client produces error messages that refer to web pages which describe
only Windows.</p>
<h2 id="web-interface">Web interface</h2>
<p>Both Dropbox and pCloud offer a web interface for uploading and
downloading files, which make these services useable on computers that
don’t have the proprietary client software. rsync.net does not offer
similar web features but, to be fair, it doesn’t require any proprietary
software. rsync.net works with any computer that can use standard
Linux/Unix file transfer tools.</p>
<p>rsync.net does have a web interface, but it’s generally for
high-level administration: billing, managing snapshots, that kind of
thing. So far as I can see, you can’t use it for managing files.</p>
<h2 id="support-for-ftp-etc.">Support for FTP, etc.</h2>
<p>rsync.net supports SFTP, and you can also run administrative and
transfer operations directly over SSH. You can use graphical rsync and
SFTP clients if you wish, or just command-line tools. None of the other
services support traditional file transfer protocols.</p>
<h2 id="mobile-device-support">Mobile device support</h2>
<p>Dropbox and pCloud both offer apps for Android and iPhone. I’ve not
used any of these extensively, so it’s hard for me to comment. The
Dropbox Android app only supports selected file transfers, not
background synchronization, so it’s of little more use on an Android
handset than the web interface. I don’t know if the iPhone app is more
useful.</p>
<p>To use rsync.net with a mobile device, you’ll need an app that
supports rsync or SFTP and, again, you’ll need to select specific files
and directories to upload and download. Obtaining compatible apps is not
difficult and, because I’m a geek, I just run <code>rsync</code> from a
terminal on my Android devices.</p>
<p>Since this is an article about Linux, not Android, I don’t want to go
into too much more detail here. In any event, I’m not really in a
position to, since I never found the mobile apps very useful, and don’t
have much experience with them.</p>
<h2 id="security-and-encryption">Security and encryption</h2>
<p>All the services described in this article encrypt data on the wire,
using methods that ought to suffice for non-military scenarios. But
that’s only part of the problem – we also have to consider encryption
‘at rest’, that is, encryption of the data on the provider’s servers. So
far as I know, only pCloud offers true end-to-end encryption, with the
stored data only decryptable by the client. And this comes at
substantial additional cost.</p>
<p>So far as I know, Dropbox offers no end-to-end encryption, so the
confidentiality of your data turns on the integrity of the Dropbox
staff. So far as I know, there’s nothing to suggest that they can’t be
trusted, but this is an issue that users should be aware of.</p>
<p>As in most things, rsync.net leaves the encryption in the hands of
the user. If you just <code>rsync</code> files to the server, then they
will be stored on the server in exactly the same format as you send
them, with or without your encryption. If, instead, you use a backup
application like Borg, then you can apply encryption if you like.
rsync.net offers the greatest flexibility in this regard, as in most
others; but you need to have the skills to take advantage of it.</p>
<h2 id="teamwork-and-file-sharing">Teamwork and file sharing</h2>
<p>Dropbox is the undisputed champion in this area (since I’m excluding
Google Drive). You can share files with selected permissions with any
Dropbox user, and these become available for background synchronization.
You can even share with non-users, who can interact with the web
console. In fact, Dropbox has a huge range of collaboration tools; I
can’t really comment on how well they work for Linux users, since I’ve
rarely used them.</p>
<p>pCloud also offers some collaboration tools, but they don’t seem to
be as well developed as the Dropbox offering. Again, it’s not easy for
me to comment, because I don’t often use these tools.</p>
<p>rsync.net offers nothing like this – it’s hard to see how it could,
given its basic architecture as a remote filesystem.</p>
<h2 id="file-administration">File administration</h2>
<p>Background file synchronization is intended to be
administration-free: the client computers and the server end up storing
the same files. Filesystem administration is therefore done on the
clients.</p>
<p>Problems arise for both pCloud and Dropbox when using them for
unsynchronized transfers, that is, for explicit file uploads and
downloads. What do you do, for example, if you upload a huge bunch of
files, accidentally including some types of file that you don’t want to
store at all (temporary files, compiler output files…)? Fixing this
situation is problematic on Dropbox, because you have to explore the
files using the web interface, and select the unwanted ones for deletion
manually.</p>
<p>It’s easier with pCloud, because the Linux client exposes the entire
storage as a virtual directory. So you can use ordinary Linux commands
to manage files (<code>find</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>grep</code>,
etc). But because these commands run on the client, and the files are
stored remotely, these procedures can be painfully slow.</p>
<p><code>rsync.net</code> allows you to run arbitrary shell commands
(with some restrictions) <em>directly on the server</em>. So if I want
to remove all the <code>.o</code> files from my source code directory, I
can run <code>find source -name *.o -exec rm {} \;</code> on the server.
I can run this command on the local virtual directory with pCloud, but
it could take all day.</p>
<p>With rsync.net you can even mount the entire remote filesystem using
<code>sshfs</code>, and then use it in the same way as pCloud’s virtual
directory. But it’s much quicker to administer the server directly, and
none of the other services provide a way to do this.</p>
<h2 id="data-recovery-and-snapshots">Data recovery and snapshots</h2>
<p>All the services I’m considering here have tools for data recovery,
that is, restoring accidental changes to the storage. These tools are
presented in different ways but, essentially, they all amount to
filesystem snapshots. All the services often some number of snapshots
free of charge, but long-lasting snapshots are usually typical of a more
premium service. rsync.net is a bit different in this regard – you can
have as many snapshots as you like, and keep them as long as you like,
but the storage counts against your overall quota. Since only
differences are stored, this might not amount to a huge amount of
storage.</p>
<p>With Dropbox and pCloud, changes made by data recovery tools are
rolled out to the synchronized storage on clients. So you might find
that files appear on the clients, or disappear. rsync.net just stores
snapshots in a hidden directory on the main filesystem.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>pCloud and Dropbox are, to some extent, directly comparable, because
they both specialize in background, unattended file synchronization. At
this time, I’ve found the Dropbox client to work better under Linux than
the pCloud one. However, the pCloud client has the advantage that it
creates a virtual directory that maps the entire server, so you can use
the same software for both background synchronization and explicit
upload/download operations. For me, this advantage isn’t sufficient to
overcome the poor reliability of the pCloud client on Linux, nor is the
slightly lower cost of pCloud. Arguably, if I needed to use end-to-end
encryption, and didn’t mind the slight additional cost, that might make
me favour pCloud. Still, the unreliability of the client simply rules it
out for me, regardless of cost or features. To be fair, the pCloud Linux
client has improved quite a lot since I first tried it about five years
ago. It’s <em>almost</em> useable now and, since there are regular
updates, I remain optimistic about it.</p>
<p>The Dropbox client is just about reliable on Linux, for small amounts
of data (&lt; 10Gb). For data I need to store, but not synchronize, I <a
href="https://github.com/kevinboone/dbcmd">wrote my own command-line
client</a>. The Dropbox proprietary client uses extended file attributes
as part of its operation, and only supports ext4 filesystems – that will
be a limitation for many users.</p>
<p>In the end I found that I was mostly using Dropbox for explicit
upload and download operations – I didn’t really use the background
synchronization, because I just had too much data for the client to cope
with. If I only had 10Gb of data then I imagine Dropbox would work fine
– but then I wouldn’t want to pay for 2Tb. I will reconsider if Dropbox
starts to offer a per-Gb pricing model, as rsync.net does.</p>
<p>It’s also worth bearing in mind that, for straightforward file
uploads and downloads – particularly uploads – rsync.net is much, much
faster than Dropbox. It’s at least ten times faster, but probably more.
I guess partly this is because simple protocols like <code>rsync</code>
and SFTP are just faster than the proprietary ones. But also I think
that Dropbox deliberately throttles some kinds of transfer.</p>
<p>For a Linux user, rsync.net offers much more flexibility that any of
the alternatives I’ve tried. If you want transparent synchronization you
can have it – but you have to implement it yourself, using scripts or
similar. You’ll probably need more self-discipline to use rsync.net than
the other offerings, because it doesn’t hold your hand at all.</p>
<p>In the end, there is no clear winner for me. All these services have
advantages and disadvantages. pCloud <em>would</em> be a definite
winner, if only its Linux client were more reliable. At present, I’m
using rsync.net, although it offers the least value for money, mostly
because it’s so fast. Still, it’s galling that rsync.net offers the
least storage, and fewest features, for my money. I guess that’s because
it’s less a mass-market offering than the competition. Still, it’s nice
to use a service for which Linux users are not second-class
customers.</p>
<p>The other great advantage of rsync.net for me – and this probably
won’t apply to everybody – is that I interact with it exactly as I do
with my home NAS. I already have most of the tools I need, to use it
effectively.</p>
