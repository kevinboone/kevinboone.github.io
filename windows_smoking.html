<h1 id="using-windows-is-like-smoking">Using Windows is like smoking
(?)</h1>
<p><img src="img/tux_win.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>I’ve heard a lot of complaints from Microsoft Windows users over the
years. At one time, the main gripe was that Windows was unreliable; too
many problems had to be solved by the ‘switch it off and on again’
method. These days, more complaints seem to be about advertising and
privacy. Windows, its users complain, has become a telemetry platform
that feeds the advertising industry using its spyware.</p>
<p>Unreliability is a solvable problem and, for the most part, it has
been solved. But Windows’ more recent annoyances won’t be so easily
prevented, since they’re intentional.</p>
<p>As a long-time Linux user and advocate, my natural inclination is to
recommend what seems to me the obvious solution. Linux, after all, is
cheaper, faster, and more reliable, and generally isn’t a privacy
hazard. So I don’t miss many opportunities to advocate for Linux.</p>
<p>My stance has come in for a certain amount of criticism, which is
fair, in a way. Some people, after all, are compelled to use Windows,
for one reason or another. Perhaps they need to use software which is
available only for Windows. Perhaps they have computers that simply
won’t run Linux or, at least, won’t run it without soul-destroying
effort. It’s not fair, I’ve been told, to keep giving people advice that
they can’t possibly put into practice.</p>
<p>Disagreements about Linux advocacy came to a head – albeit not for
the first or last time – following a post on Mastodon by a certain Ruben
Schade from Australia. The original Mastodon thread has been cleaned up
but, in essence, <a
href="https://rubenerd.com/people-who-need-to-run-windows/">what he
posted</a> was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Linux people, please understand this. Sometimes people need to run
Windows. They’re allowed to complain about Windows ads, or tracking, or
any other enshittification problems, without you saying “use Linux”
every time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Mr Schade was saying, if I understand correctly, is that it’s OK
for Windows users to complain, and it’s not OK for Linux advocates to
make the obvious response. What’s significant about this particular post
was the amount of frothing at the mouth it engendered. I may, or may
not, agree with the idea Mr Schade expressed, but it’s expressed
politely, and doesn’t seem to be obvious trolling. I might have expected
some equally polite rebuttal but, in fact, what happened was a
shit-storm of such magnitude that the operators of the Mastodon server
had to step in to prevent the system being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>So in this article I’m considering whether it really is excusable for
a Windows user to complain about Windows while continuing to use it, and
whether it’s OK for a Linux advocate to make the obvious suggestion in
response. I think cigarette smoking is a useful analogy, for reasons
I’ll explain.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-ok-to-complain">Is it OK to complain?</h2>
<p>It seems to me that it’s perfectly reasonable for Windows users to
complain about Windows, even when there’s an obvious solution. It’s
reasonable for smokers to complain that they wake up coughing every
morning, even though there is, again, an obvious solution. Why? It’s
<em>hard</em> to give up smoking, that’s why. I have friends and family
who have been trying for years. I’ve seen them walking around with so
many nicotine patches stuck to their bodies that they can hardly get
their clothes on. They’ve tried drugs and hypnosis and accupunture and
all the rest of it. Smoking messes with your brain chemistry; giving it
up is like giving up breathing.</p>
<p>Similarly, it’s hard to give up Windows. Almost every personal
computer is delivered with Windows pre-installed. A heap of popular
software won’t run on anything else. Many people are provided with
computers by their employers, and aren’t allowed to run anything except
Windows, even if they wanted to. Almost all schools teach IT using
computers running Windows, so young people are trained to accept it
almost from birth.</p>
<p>Just as with giving up smoking, many people who give up Windows
relapse – sometimes after a short time, sometimes after a long one. I’ve
seen people give up on Linux after twenty years. Some people relapse
many times over a period of years. There are many reasons for this, just
as there are for failing to give up smoking: peer pressure is an
important one, in both cases.</p>
<p>Microsoft, like all the tech monopolies, realize this. They can turn
their operating system into a telemetry platform precisely because they
know that most people won’t quit. I’ve watched Windows become more and
more user-hostile over the years and, while the amount of moaning has
increased enormously, the amount of quitting hasn’t. If it were a
five-minute job to install and learn Linux, Microsoft wouldn’t be able
to treat its customers as atrociously as they do. But it isn’t.</p>
<p>So, yes, I think Windows users are entitled to complain, although
their problems, in principle, are solvable ones. I confess that I don’t
offer a whole lot of sympathy, and perhaps I should, if I were a better
person.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-ok-to-give-the-obvious-advice">Is it OK to give the
obvious advice?</h2>
<p>If I were a doctor, and a smoker came to me for advice about his
persistent cough, I feel that not only would it be OK for me to
recommend he give up smoking, I have a <em>duty</em> to do so. I know
how hard it is to quit, and I know that many who try will fail; but
still I have an obligation to recommend quitting.</p>
<p>To complain about Windows and to expect <em>not</em> to be told to
“use something else” is like a smoker asking his doctor: “What can I do
about my cough, other than quit smoking?” A sympathetic doctor will
likely try to help, even with this constraint; but, in the end, there’s
only one course of action that offers real hope of relief.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-a-reasonable-analogy">Is this a reasonable analogy?</h2>
<p>Obviously, smoking and using Windows are not equivalent. Nobody ever
died from Windows, even if it saps your will to live. Still, some of the
implications are similar. Windows, like smoking, is a nasty habit, which
is unpleasant for the sufferer. Its telemetry has risks for the
individual that are hard to assess. There are important economic
consequences, too – cigarettes are expensive; Windows and Windows
applications are expensive. The constant need to upgrade hardware to run
the latest Windows is also expensive.</p>
<p>There’s another way in which using Windows is like smoking: it isn’t
just the individual smoker, or the individual Windows user, who is
affected. The economic impact of smoking on the smoker are obvious, of
course, but there are implications for wider society, too. In a society
with state-funded healthcare, smoking costs <em>everybody</em>. By
analogy, the ubiquity of advertising platforms masquerading as operating
systems makes <em>everything</em> more expensive for the consumer,
because all that advertising isn’t paying for itself. And the way in
which Microsoft and hardware manufacturers collude to ensure that there
is a constant need for new equipment is damaging to the consumer and to
the environment.</p>
<p>So, for sure, it’s not a perfect analogy. But I think it’s close
enough to be useful.</p>
<h2 id="helping-people-to-quit">Helping people to quit</h2>
<p>It doesn’t help people to quit smoking by haranging or mocking them.
The first step must surely be for the smoker to want to quit. Windows
users need to see that there’s a better alternative, even if it’s going
to take a lot of effort to adopt it. It’s no more effective to say “Just
use Linux” than it is to say “Just stop smoking”. A better approach,
perhaps, is to say something like “There is a way to avoid the problems
that Windows creates, but it’s going to take real commitment and, in the
end, it might not be worth it for you”.</p>
<p>That’s not going to win many converts, but nor is mocking or
insulting people. What <em>has</em> won converts, over the years, is
showing Windows users that I don’t have to pay extra for a word
processor or a spreadsheet. Or that I can convert <em>any</em> kind of
document to PDF format, without hunting for a third-party application
that will probably turn out to be full of malware. Or that there are
Linux media players that will play any kind of content, without showing
a bunch of intrusive ads. And so on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even to get into a conversation about the benefits
(and costs) of Linux, the Windows user has to be willing to take a
half-step in that direction. Telling him he’s an idiot isn’t going to
encourage him to do this.</p>
<p>There’s also a question of context. If a person is asking <em>on a
Windows forum</em> what he can do to reduce the amount of advertising he
sees, that’s not the right place to advocate for Linux. As a person who
lives an ad-free life, without Google or Microsoft, it would be very
difficult for me <em>not</em> to make a smug response. But, since I
don’t use Windows forums, I am spared that temptation.</p>
<p>Similarly, it makes no sense to recommend Linux to somebody who
stands no chance of getting to grips with it. I’ll be offering my
services as free technical support for an indefinite time.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-linux-advocates-so-intrusive">Why are Linux advocates so
intrusive?</h2>
<p>Given that most Windows users are unable to kick the habit, for one
reason or another, why are some Linux users so keen to push the idea of
change on them? Why do we (some of us) feel compelled to plug Linux at
every opportunity? Why do we (some of us) do so in such a smug, rude
way?</p>
<p>In some cases, I have to admit, it’s just an opportunity to gloat, or
demonstrate some specious <a href="linux_snob.html">technical
superiority</a>. Sometimes, it’s as if Linux users feel a religious
obligation to evangelise. For these folks, Linux is part of their
identity, and they are compelled to try to bring others into the
fold.</p>
<p>For my part, it just pains me to see people struggling with Windows
and conflicted about it, when I know there is a better way. I’m also
aware that an IT landscape that is dominated by mega-corporations is
unhealthy for society as a whole. Others’ use of Windows is a problem
for me, even if they don’t see it as a problem for themselves. I’ve
certainly had people tell me “I’m willing to have my personal data
plundered and used for advertising, if it makes my computer easier to
use”. That’s their choice but, frankly, I’m not keen on having the whole
Internet turned into an advertising billboard so they can exercise that
choice.</p>
<p>So I suspect that most misdirected Linux advocacy is born out of a
sense of frustration. Yes, using Windows is a choice, and we should
respect that. But, at the same time, we know it’s a <em>bad</em> choice,
and it’s a choice that has consequences for everybody.</p>
<h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h2>
<p>Windows users are, for the most part, not ignorant or lazy. I’m
interested in <a href="rc2014.html">building and programming 8-bit
microcomputers</a>, and I’ve found to my surprise that most people in
that community use Windows for software development. If you’re capable
of learning to program CP/M in assembly language, you’re
<em>certainly</em> capable of learning to use Linux, if you want. Some
people are genuinely happy to use Windows, or are willing to live with
it, fully informed about the compromizes this entails.</p>
<p>At the same time, the IT world would be a better place if there were
realistic, affordable alternatives to Windows. Microsoft can treat its
customers like commodities exactly because there are so few realistic
alternatives.</p>
<p>So, just as there are occasions on which it’s appropriate to advise
people of the dangers of smoking, there are occasions on which we might
carefully advocate for Linux. Deciding whether an occasion actually is
appropiate can be tricky, of course.</p>
