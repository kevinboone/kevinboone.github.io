<h1>A Raspberry Pi and touchscreen case that anybody can make</h1>

<p>
<img src="img/pi_wooden_case_finished_2.jpg" 
  alt="wooden case finished" class="article-top-image"/>
I've been looking for a long time for a commercial Raspberry Pi case
that is large enough to accommodate a 7" touchscreen, has an audio
amplifier and speaker, and provides access to the GPIO header. Ideally
it would be battery powered, not just for supply independence, but
for reliability reasons that I'll discuss later.
</p>
<p>
To the best of my knowledge, no such product is made. In fact, no 
<i>similar</i> product exists, so I've had to make my own.
</p>
<p>
In this article I outline the construction of the case shown in
the photo below,
which is made mostly from pre-cut wooden parts and needs only
hand tools to build and assemble. I think that the wooden construction
looks reasonably pleasant, but I'm using it for ease of construction,
rather than for its aesthetics. I'm not giving detailed plans, because
I assume that anybody who would be interested in something like this
would have specific requirements. I do describe the fiddly bits
in the construction,
however, in the hope that these details will save other people a
bit of time.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/pi_wooden_case_finished_1.jpg" 
  alt="wooden case finished" width="650px"/>
</p>

<h2>Design goals</h2>

<p>
1. The unit can be constructed using only simple hand tools, requiring
no great accuracy, by a person with modest construction skills. So far
as possible, the case is made entirely of pre-cut plywood panels of 
A5 size (by good fortune, A5 is just large enough to fit the 
official Pi 7" touchscreen, and a number of ports and switches).
</p>
<p>
2. The design uses only parts that are widely available, 
from on-line retailers (since "inessential"
shopping is currently forbidden in much of the World).
</p>
<p>
3. The unit will be self-contained, with its own touchscreen and loudspeaker, 
and powered by rechargeable batteries.
</p>
<p>
4. There will be easy access to the GPIO header, without the need for
tools or dismantling. 
</p>
<p>
5. It will be possible to exchange SD cards, without dismantling and
without tools.
</p>
<p>
6. It must be possible to dismantle the unit completely using only a
screwdriver.
</p>

<h2>Prototyping</h2>

I prototyped the case in Foamex, using the method described
<a href="pi_case.html">in this article</a>. I was therefore reasonably
sure that all the parts would fit. It's possible to get
Foamex board in 3mm and 6mm thickness to match the plywood I used
in the final design. However, 3mm Foamex is too flimsy to make a 
working prototype, so I would suggest using 6mm and making allowances
for the slightly reduced space in the final design.

<h2>Parts and components</h2>

<p>
The most specialist component used in this design is the  
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08NJSR77R/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Pi UPS HAT</a> with 8.4V power supply. This is useful for reasons other than providing a battery backup, 
as I'll discuss later.
</p>

<p>
You'll also need the following, if you follow my design closely (and,
of course, there's no particular reason to).
</p>

<ul>

<li><p>
Wood for the case. My design uses pre-cut plywood pieces of A5 size,
which are widely available. If you have a table saw or fine-tooth circular
saw you can buy sheet wood and make the case any size you like. However,
my design intentionally calls for no accurate or elegant cutting. I 
used 3mm birch plywood
for the front, back, top, and bottom, and 6mm birch plywood for the sides.
Using thicker wood for the sides improves the sound quality from the 
loudspeaker. If you aren't including the loudspeaker, there's no 
advantage to using thicker wood. If you don't have professional woodworking
tools available,
using 3mm wood for the front panel is essential -- there's too much
cutting on this front panel to use thicker wood. 
</p></li>

<li><p>
Wood glue for assembling the case. I used two-part quick-setting epoxy.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Varnish, paint, or wood stain to suit your taste. 
</p></li>

<li><p>
A length of 1" x 1" planed timber (or similar) cut into (approximately) 1"
cubes. These will be the corner pieces of the case -- all the wooden
case panels will be screwed to these corner pieces.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Small screws for screwing the case together -- 3/4" size 8 or similar,
but the size isn't critical.
</p></li>

<li><p>
A small loudspeaker (if you're including the audio amplifier). It won't need
to be able to handle more than a couple of watts, because any more than that
will strain the power supply.
You'll also need speaker-mounting hardware (e.g. 3mm nuts and bolts).
</p></li>

<li><p>
Parts for the audio amplifier, if you're using one. You can buy a ready-made
mono amplifier module <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/ICQUANZX-XPT8871-Channel-Digital-Amplifier/dp/B07VH77MCN/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=5v+mono+amplifier+module&qid=1610034896&sr=8-5">like this one</a>, or
design and build your own. I'll discuss the audio amplifier in more detail
later.
</p></li>

<li><p>
An official 7" touch-screen, available from many vendors. Because it's so
widely available, it's worth shopping around to find one that is on
special-offer -- I can usually get them for around Â£30, at the cost of a
bit of web searching.
</p></li>

<li><p>
If you want to retain access to the Pi's GPIO using an opening in the 
top of the case, you'll need a
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B088DB57RY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1">GPIO right-angle adapter</a>.
In my design, the GPIO pins are pointing towards the back of the case --
but they're nowhere near close enough to the back of the case to be able
to access them. The right-angle adapter allows the GPIO pins to point upwards,
making them easy to access through a slot in the top of the case.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Several USB panel-mounted extensions, <a target="_blank"
https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08NJSR77R/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">like
this one</a>. These are also available with circular bezels, for which the
panel cut-out can be made just with a large drill bit or hole cutter. The
rectangular
ones need some cutting and filing, unless you have a laser cutter handy.
Both single and double outlets are available. I used two singles on the
front panel, because the double was hard to fit between the screen bezel
and the bottom of the case. I used a double on the back, just to reduce the
amount of panel cutting.
</p></li>

<li><p>
If you want to bring the HDMI signal out to a socket, you'll need a
panel-mounted HDMI extender. You'll probably also need an HDMI right-angle
adapter, because the HDMI cable won't fit between the Pi and the bottom
of the case if leaves the Pi heading downwards. Using the right-angle 
adapter allows the HDMI cable to leave the Pi heading backwards. You
could also expose the Ethernet socket using a panel-mounted extender, 
but all the products I've seen for sale have a right-angle connection
at the plug (Pi) end. This means that the plug fouls the USB ports on
the Pi, limiting the number that can be used.
</p></li>

<li><p>
If you want to bring out the headphone socket, you'll need the parts for
this. I haven't been able to find a ready-made extender, so you'll need
to solder one up yourself using a 3.5mm plug, 3.5mm socket, and a short
length of screened cable. My design uses a loudspeaker, and does not expose
the headphone output, which feeds the speaker amplifier directly.
</p></li>

<li><p>
A panel-mounted socket and corresponding plug for the power supply connection.
I used 6.3mm sockets because they have low contact resistance and a positive
engagement.
</p></li>

<li><p>
3.5mm plug for connecting the audio amplifier (if used) to the 
Pi's headphone output.
</p></li>

<li><p>
About six inches of screened cable for connecting the heaphone output
to the amplifier.
</p></li>

<li><p>
If you're including an audio amplifier, you'll need to some method
for connecting the power supply, audio amplifier, and speaker. 
If you're using stripboard or a PCB, header plugs and sockets are
ideal -- and you'll probably have the parts if you're used to connecting
to the Pi GPIO.
</p></li>

<li><p>
A panel-mounted main switch, which should be rated for at 
least 3 amps DC. A substantial 
switch is better, because it will have a lower contact resistance than a 
cheap, flimsy one, even with the same nominal current rating. A low contact
resistance is very important in this design.
</p></li>

<li><p>
A few feet of hook-up wire, ideally in different colours. For those parts
of the wiring that carry significant current, you can double-up or triple-up
the conductors to reduce the resistance, where high currents are involved.
</p></li>

<li><p>
2.5mm stand-offs, for assembling the sandwich of HATs that make up the system.
It's probably most cost-effective to buy these in a set of mixes sizes, 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0778JRXPS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">like this one</a>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
3mm bolts of various lengths, with washer, the panel fittings and
mounting the touchscreen. These can be metal or plastic.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Feet for the case. I used simple stick-on rubber feet.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Self-adhesive screw covers, to conceal the ugly screw heads. Of course,
you could use some other method to do this.
</p></li>

<ul>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>
Building and assembling the case requires only "garden shed" tools. If 
you're building or integrating an audio amplifier, you'll need
basic electronic tools as well.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
A fine-bladed saw of some kind. Only two cuts in the wood of the main
case are required, and they can be placed at the back where they
aren't very visible. So great precision is not required. I made the
rectangular panel cut-outs by sawing the rough shape, then finishing using
sandpaper and a file.
</p></li>

<li><p>
A (probably electric) drill, with 1mm and 3mm bits for general use, plus
whatever bits are needed to drill holes for the circular 
panel-mounting components.
A countersink bit helps with setting the case screws below the wood
surface. A hole-cutting attachment makes quick work for drilling the
large panel hole for the loudspeaker -- but you cut cut-and-file this
instead, if you have the patience.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Various screwdrivers. 
</p></li>

<li><p>
A soldering iron, especially if you're building your own audio amplifier.
You might not need to solder to the panel-mounted parts, if you buy parts
with screw or crimp connectors. 
</p></li>

<li><p>
Wire stripper and/or side cutters.
</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>Assembling the electronic parts</h2>

<p>
I'll describe the individual electronic components below -- this
section is just about the overall design and layout.
</p>
<p>
In this design, the entire electronic installation consists of "HATs",
piggy-backed onto the back of the touchscreen. You can see the complete
stack in the below, although the details are not entirely visible because
of the lighting.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/pi_wooden_case_board_stack.jpg" 
  alt="stack of boards mounted on the rear of the touchscreen" width="650px"/>
</p>

<p>
From top to bottom (that's front to back in the case) we have:
</p>
<p>
the touchscreen (only part of the grey metal body can be seen through the
cut-out in the front panel);
</p>
<p>
the touchscreen driver board. You might just be able to see the 5V
connections to the driver at the top left of the photo. The other
ends of these 5V connections are to GPIO pins;
</p>
<p>
the Pi board (mostly invisible, because it's hidden under its own
GPIO header). The USB extension cables are visible to the right of
the Pi board -- two of these go to the front panel, and two to the
rear (although this is flexible, of course);
</p>
<p>
GPIO right-angle adapter, for providing access to the GPIO header from
a hatch in the top of the case;
</p>
<p>
home-made audio amplifier board. I made this on a piece of strip-board,
drilled so that it would attach to the battery HAT.
</p>
<p>
The audio amplifier board is connected to the small loudspeaker, a
5V supply from the battery HAT (that's the red/black twisted
pair at the bottom of the amplifier board), and the Pi headphone
output (using a very short screened cable, which is not highly visible).
The unused header pins at the top of the amplifier are for connecting
a 5V case fan, should one prove necessary. For a Raspberry Pi 4, a 
small fan is probably necessary. For a Pi 3, probably not.
</p>

<p>
Note that there's <i>just</i> enough space to the right of the Pi
board to accommodate the USB extension cables. The loudspeaker
needs to be mounted vertically on its panel in such a position
that it doesn't foul these cables. I placed the speaker centrally,
and there's just enough space.
</p>

<h2>Making the front panel and mounting the touchscreen</h2>

<p>
This is by far the most fiddly part of the construction, because the
official Pi 7" touchscreen really isn't built to be panel-mounted. Its
only mounting points are four threaded holes on the back of the metal part
of the screen (see photo below).
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/pi_wooden_case_screen_rear.png" 
  alt="photo of rear of touchscreen" width="650px"/>
</p>

<p>
If we mount the metal part of the touchscreen on the front panel, the
delicate glass part will stand proud of the panel by about 8mm, which is both 
fragile and unsightly. We must either provide some sort of spacer between
the glass part of the screen and the panel, or find a way to set the
screen back in the panel, so its glass part is flush with the panel.
</p>
<p>
The latter approach would probably be the more aesthetically satisfying,
but is very difficult to implement with a wooden panel. You'd have to
cut a very precise hole in the panel, so that the metal part of the
touchscreen could <i>just</i> pass through it. Then you'd have to construct
some arrangement of brackets to fasten the screen using the threaded holes,
which will now be either below or above the rear surface of the front panel
(depending on how thick the panel is). This is a non-trivial operation 
using only hand tools. 
</p>
<p>
The first approach -- the one I've adopted -- is to put a spacer between
the touchscreen glass, and the front panel. The spacer needs to be 
8mm thick, and thin enough to fit between the metallic part of
the touchscreen and the glass. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, if you had the tools and materials to construct such a spacer
from raw materials,
you probably wouldn't be reading this. 
However, suitable spacers are already available, and
not very expensive. What I did was obtain a cheap Pi desktop
stand like the
<a target="_blank" href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-7-touchscreen-display-frame?variant=6337432321">Pibow touchscreen frame</a>,
and throw away the leg parts. This leaves a spacer of exactly the
right size and shape.
</p>
<p>
I mounted the touchscreen on the front panel as in the diagram below:
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/pi_wooden_case_front_panel.png" 
  alt="assembly of front panel and touchscreen" width="650px"/>
</p>
<p>
Note that the method of cutting the hole in the front panel 
is non-critical -- it 
won't be visible. It must be large enough to allow the driver board of
the touchscreen to pass through. If it's large enough to allow the Pi
and the complete HAT stack to pass through, that's even better -- you'll
be able to remove the entire functional part of the system through the
front of the case. This certainly makes maintenance easier. However,
if you make the cut-out too large, the front panel will be flimsy.
</p>
<p>
Although the panel cut-out need not be elegant, the position of the
cut-out needs
some careful thought.
The touchscreen needs to be mounted in the front panel in such a way as to
allow space for the front panel ports and controls. There needs to be
room between the Pi and the case sides for access to the USB ports.
Moreover, because the Pi will be mounted directly
on the back of the touchscreen, placing the touchscreen higher on the
front panel has the effect of placing the Pi GPIO header closer to the
top of the case. Since this is the way I plan to get access to the GPIO,
it makes sense to place the touchscreen as high on the front panel as
practicable, but not so high that it looks peculiar. I found that,
with an A5-size front panel, placing the touchscreen so that it was 
about 8mm from the top, left, and right, worked reasonably well.
This puts the GPIO header about 40mm below the top of the case, which
is reasonably accessible.
</p>
<p>
Even using a pre-fabricated touchscreen spacer, 
assembly of touchscreen in the front panel is fiddly. The touchscreen
is fastened to the front panel using four 3mm bolts that pass through holes
drilled in the panel. These holes must be placed very exactly, and there's no
way to do this except by careful measuring of the positions of the
threaded holes in the back of the touchscreen. If you drill the panel holes
over-sized, then the touchscreen will be easier to mount -- but it will
be a sloppy fit. 
</p>
<p>
The length of the 3mm bolts is also rather sensitive. If they're too
short, they won't grip the touchscreen properly. But if they're too
long, you won't be able to tighten then enough, without screwing them
into the back of the touchscreen and breaking it. I find that, 
with a 3mm panel, bolts of 6mm length are about right. You might need
to cut some bolts to this length, if the exact length isn't available.
Plastic bolts are both easier to cut,
and less likely to damage the touchscreen if you screw them in too far.
</p>
<p>
With the touchscreen positioned -- and then removed for safekeeping --
we can drill or cut the rest of the front panel controls. I've placed
the main switch, power supply socket, and a couple of USB connections
on the front panel. This makes the front panel and the components
mounted on it a completely self-contained computer. However, it might
be more aesthetic to put the power-supply connection on the back
panel -- at the expense of making dismantling for maintenance more
fiddly.
</p>
<p>
The USB sockets can be mounted either behind or in front of the panel
-- the only difference is the size of the cut-out required. There isn't
really a lot to pick between the two approaches.
</p>

<h2>Battery power supply</h2>

<p>
The battery power supply for this unit is a proprietary HAT device
powered by two 18650 batteries. In my tests, this unit will 
power the system for
between one and six hours, depending on load, display brightness, audio
volume, etc. The HAT powers the Pi directly through its
GPIO pins, so the current path is short. 
Using a battery supply has a significant 
advantage <i>apart from</i> the obvious one of 
making it possible to run the unit whilst
away from a mains supply. It needs a bit of thought to appreciate
why this is so.
</p>
<p>
The battery power supply is rated for a
continuous current of 3 amps, and the unit <i>does</i> draw this
much current under full load, with the touchscreen backlight on maximum
brightness, and audio playing at full volume. With this current, there
can be significant voltage drops along the power supply cabling,
particular with a low power supply voltage like 5V.
The battery 
voltage is considerably higher than the Pi's 5V supply voltage -- 
8.3V in the supply I'm using. Connecting
the 5V power output from the PSU directly to the Pi's GPIO pins reduces
the electrical resistance of the supply path, compared to
using a cable connection connection. In addition,
the voltage regular in the PSU will continue to deliver 5V from the
8.3V battery, even if
there is a significant current drain. 
</p>
<p>
These factors together mean that, even though the electronic parts 
between them can draw up to 3 amps, the Pi's power
voltage remains stable at 5V. This is surprisingly difficult to
achieve when powering a high-current design like this from a 5V mains
adapter.
</p>
<p>
The battery supply board has an on-off switch but, irritatingly,
no contacts for connecting
a panel-mounted main switch. So I had to solder some contacts onto the board
 to make good this omission (more on this later).
</p>


<h2>Audio amplifier</h2>

<p>
Building my own audio amplifier had the advantage that I could make it
part of the stack of the boards that comprises the main body of
the system.
This makes for a compact overall design, with few long cables. 
</p>
<p>
The most important design factor in the audio amplifier is the relationship
between the output power and the available supply current. 
The power supply is rated for 3A, of which the Pi and touchscreen
can take 2.5A at full load and brightness. 
So I wanted the audio amplifier to draw no more 
than 0.5A at full volume. Assuming that 
the amplifier itself is
100% efficient (which it isn't, of course) that corresponds to
an output power of one watt. With a small loudspeaker in a rigid case,
one watt is actually quite loud. 
</p>
<p>
There are many readily-available ICs that will provide a mono audio
amplifier with 1W output, without external heatsinks. However, the low
available supply voltage, and the single-rail supply, do limit the choices.
The amplifier is powered from the Pi's 5V supply, although I could have
powered it from the 8V supply provided by the batteries (but this
would have required soldering directly to the PSU board). As it turns
out, 5V is more than enough to provide the 1W design output.
</p>
<p>
The quality of the Pi's audio output is pretty poor by hi-fi standards,
and I won't be using a carefully-turned speaker enclosure, so there's
no point spending a lot of time and money on the amplifier circuit.
</p>
<p>
With these factors in mind, I built my amplifier using a circuit based on the 
notorious (and dirt-cheap) 
LM386 single-rail amplifier IC. There are many circuit ideas 
for such an amplifier (including some in the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm386.pdf">datasheet</a>). 
The LM386 has a default gain of 20, but I reduced it (in effect) 
by combining the left and right audio outputs of the Pi 
using a voltage divider. 
This is necessary because the Pi's audio carries a fair amount of
irritating high-frequency noise. If the amplifier gain were too high,
we'd be running the Pi's audio at low output level, but the noise wouldn't
be any lower, so the signal-to-noise ratio would be poor.
Reducing the amplifier gain allows the Pi's output level to
be high, providing a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio.
</p>
<p>
Even with careful control of gain, it's still necessary to provide a 
bit of low-pass filtering at the amplifier
input, to control the noise. I've also noticed that some USB accessories
generate a lot of noise that seems to be hard to control. So when setting
up the audio amplifier, it's worth testing with everything disconnected,
so you know what the minimum noise will be.
</p>
<p>
Since this is an article about building a case, and not about electronic
design, I won't be saying any more about the audio amplifier. However,
if anybody wants more details, just ask.
</p>

<h2>Main switch</h2>

<p>
The power supply HAT I used does not have contacts for connecting an external main power
switch. It has an on-board switch, but it's not easy to get to when the unit
is in a case. I soldered connections for the main switch directly to the 
on-board switch -- ugly, but I couldn't see an alternative. Of course, the
on-board switch has to remain permanently off, for the panel switch to
be able to switch the supply.
</p>
<p>
The connections to the main switch will carry the whole load current of
the Pi, the touch-screen, the audio amplifier, and anything powered from
the GPIO. So the wiring needs to be substantial: I would aim for at
least a 20A current capacity -- not because the current will be this high,
but because proper operation relies on there being no appreciable voltage
drop along this wiring.
</p>

<h2>GPIO access</h2>

<p>
A small hatch in the top of the case provides access to the GPIO header. 
The header pins are pointing upwards, because of the GPIO right-angle
adapter, so it's easy enough to push a cable onto the GPIO. A foot-long
GPIO cable can be rolled up and tucked into the hatch, as shown in the
photo below.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/pi_wooden_case_gpio_access.jpg" 
  alt="port in the case top, for access to the GPIO header" width="650px"/>
</p>

<p>
A wooden barrier, which is glued to underside of the case top, protects
the electronic components from accidental contact by fingers or tools:
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/pi_wooden_case_top.jpg" 
  alt="wooden divider glued to case top" width="650px"/>
</p>

<h2>Loudspeaker</h2>

<p>
Using a 4-ohm speaker will allow a better output power with the
low supply voltage of the amplifier but, apart from that, 
choice of speaker is not critical. Obviously, it needs to fit 
in the case -- I put my speaker in the left side panel, but the
right side is less crowded, and might be a better choice with a
larger speaker.
</p>
<p>
It's worth bearing in mind that the speaker will vibrate the case,
and there could be nasty-sounding resonances. This is particularly
likely if anything is loose and might vibrate. Sound quality can 
probably be improved by stuffing the whole case with acoustic
wadding -- but this will compromise cooling. 
</p>

<h2>Ventilation</h2>
<p>
There's a big hole for GPIO access in the top of the case, and I 
drilled a grid of holes in the rear panel. With a Pi 3, these passive
ventilation measures are sufficient for cooling, even under load. I'm less
convinced that this is true with the Pi 4, so I've left the option
open to fit a 5V, low-speed fan on the rear panel if it proves to
be necessary.

<h2>SD card</h2>
<p>
With the "HAT stack" method of assembly, with all the electronic parts
stacked behind the touchscreen, getting to the SD card is a real bear.
It ends up tucked under the data cable that connects the touchscreen to the
Pi, and is fiddly to get to even when the Pi isn't in a case.
</p>
<p>
My Pi experimentation leads me to swap in and out SD cards every few
minutes -- I really don't want to have to take the case to pieces to
to this. So I connected the SD card slot to an SD extender. If you
search for "SD extender" on Amazon or eBay, you'll find many of these.
It's hard for me to recommend one over another -- they all seem much
the same. I paid about five quid for mine. 
</p>
<p>
These extenders are usually 25cm-40cm long. This seems to me to be a long
distance to extend a high-speed parallel data connection; but, so far,
it has proven to be reliable. 
</p>


<h2>Mechanical assembly</h2>

<p>
I built the front panel first, then built the rest of the case from it.
The six pieces that make up the case are held in place using inch cubes
of wood, which can be seen in the photo above. I glued the cubes in place
on one of the panels using epoxy resin, and then screwed the other
panel pieces into place when the adhesive was dry. You could save a couple
of pounds by using PVA wood glue instead, but it takes longer to dry.
Quick-setting epoxy dries to workable hardness in about ten minutes, 
and then won't accidentally stick panels that are supposed to be
screwed together.
</p>
<p>
Before I assembled the case, I put on a few coats of clear varnish. 
I quite like the visible wood grain, but you could stain, paint,
or veneer the case instead. 
</p>
<p>
I finished the construction by sticking on the rubber feet and the wood-veneer
screw covers.
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
If you want a decently-sized, robust case for a Raspberry Pi and touchscreen,
that provides battery power and a loudspeaker, there's little alternative
to building your own. 
I quite enjoy woodworking, so I don't mind making the effort. I remain
a little surprised, however, that none of the many Pi accessory 
manufacturers has risen to the challenge of producing one commercially.
