</p>
<p>

Apache ActiveMQ and Apache Artemis (or ActiveMQ Artemis) are open-source
message brokers with somewhat similar functionality. Both implementations
are venerable, with histories that go back to the early
2000s. However, Artemis is in some senses a more modern implementation
because, ironically, it has a smaller feature set. This makes Artemis
easier to maintain, which is important if you're basing a commercial
product on it. The smaller feature set means a smaller overall implementation,
which fits well with the contemporary emphasis on microservices. 
Red Hat's A-MQ (now AMQ) product line was, until recently,
based on ActiveMQ, but attention has shifted now to Artemis. 
ActiveMQ is no longer maintained as vigorously by the open source 
community as it once was but, at the time of writing, Amazon is still
offering a message broker service based on ActiveMQ. Whether it
has a long-term future, at Amazon or elsewhere, remains to be seen.
</p>
<p>
Leaving aside the complex, niche features that ActiveMQ offered (such as
message routing based on Apache Camel rules) ActiveMQ and Artemis look
similar to the integrator and, in most practical applications, 
provide comparable throughput.
However, they differ in a number of important areas, of which networking
is one that causes particular problems for integrators who want to move from
ActiveMQ to Artemis.
</p>
<p>
This article is about creating a broker mesh with Artemis, that 
behaves, so far as possible, in the same way as a comparable mesh of
ActiveMQ brokers. By a "mesh" I mean a group of brokers whose members are 
connected each to the other, with independent message stores. This
is often also referred to as an "active-active" configuration.
</p>
<p>
I'll describe the basic Artemis mesh configuration first, 
and then explain what needs
to be done to make it work more like ActiveMQ.
</p>


<h2>Basic configuration</h2>

<p>
For simplicity, I'm assuming that the brokers in the mesh have network
names "broker1", "broker2", etc., and each listens for all messaging 
protocols on
port 61616 (this is the default for Artemis as well as ActiveMQ).
The set-up I describe below is for "broker1", but there is a high
degree of symmetry, and it isn't hard to work out the other broker
settings. 
</p>
<p>
When creating a new broker, the usual approach is to run <code>artemis create brokerXXX</code> to create an outline configuration. I'm assuming that this
has been done, and so only mesh-related configuration has to be added
to <code>etc/broker.xml</code>.
</p>

<p>
Every Artemis broker will have at least one <code>acceptor</code> definition,
that defines the TCP port and the protocols that will be accepted on that
port. There's
probably nothing different about this definition in a broker mesh, compared
to a stand-alone broker. Here is an example, for a broker that accepts
all wire protocols on port 61616:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;acceptor</font></b> <font color="#009900">name</font><font color="#990000">=</font><font color="#FF0000">"artemis"</font><b><font color="#0000FF">&gt;</font></b>tcp://0.0.0.0:61616?
   protocols=CORE,AMQP,STOMP,HORNETQ,MQTT,OPENWIRE/&gt;
</pre>

<p>
In practice, an acceptor that handles multiple protocols will probably have
a lot of additional configuration, but that's not really relevant here.
In any case, the instance creation step will already have created an outline
entry; you'll only need to change it if you want a specific configuration,
such as using different network interfaces for client and inter-broker
communication.
</p>

<p>
Next, we need to define connectors. These are equivalent to the 
"network-connector" definitions in ActiveMQ, but there is one significant
difference: with Artemis we will usually define the broker itself 
as a connector.  Here is an example:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">  <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;connectors&gt;</font></b>
    <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;connector</font></b> <font color="#009900">name</font><font color="#990000">=</font><font color="#FF0000">"myself"</font><b><font color="#0000FF">&gt;</font></b>tcp://broker1:61616<b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;/connector&gt;</font></b>
    <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;connector</font></b> <font color="#009900">name</font><font color="#990000">=</font><font color="#FF0000">"broker2"</font><b><font color="#0000FF">&gt;</font></b>tcp://broker2:61616<b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;/connector&gt;</font></b>
    <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;connector</font></b> <font color="#009900">name</font><font color="#990000">=</font><font color="#FF0000">"broker3"</font><b><font color="#0000FF">&gt;</font></b>tcp://broker3:61616<b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;/connector&gt;</font></b>
  <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;/connectors&gt;</font></b>
</pre>

<p>
Here, the first entry "myself" denotes the current broker, with its 
hostname and port. Subsequent entries define the other brokers in the
mesh. For symmetry, I could have given the self-referential connector
the name "broker1", to match the "broker2", etc., that follow.
This naming approach may be useful if you have a large mesh, and you want to cut-and-paste
configuration from one broker to another. However, sometimes it is clearer
if the self-referential connector stands out in some way. In any
case, the important point here is to define connectors for every broker
in the mesh, including this one.
</p>
<p>
The final vital piece of configuration assembles the various
broker connectors into a mesh. Artemis provides a number of discovery mechanisms
by which brokers can find one another in the network. However, if you're
more familiar with ActiveMQ, you're probably used to specifying the
mesh members explicitly. The following example shows how to do
that, for the connectors listed in the configuration above. Note that
I'm referring to this broker itself as "myself" here, to match the 
connector definition above. It would be a mistake
to list the current broker as a cluster connection, which is why I prefer to
use a distinctive name.
</p>


<pre class="codeblock">  <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;cluster-connections&gt;</font></b>
    <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;cluster-connection</font></b> <font color="#009900">name</font><font color="#990000">=</font><font color="#FF0000">"my_mesh"</font><b><font color="#0000FF">&gt;</font></b>
      <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;connector-ref&gt;</font></b>myself<b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;/connector-ref&gt;</font></b>
      <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;message-load-balancing&gt;</font></b>ON_DEMAND<b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;/message-load-balancing&gt;</font></b>
      <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;static-connectors&gt;</font></b>
        <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;connector-ref&gt;</font></b>broker2<b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;/connector-ref&gt;</font></b>
        <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;connector-ref&gt;</font></b>broker3<b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;/connector-ref&gt;</font></b>
      <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;/static-connectors&gt;</font></b>
    <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;/cluster-connection&gt;</font></b>
  <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;/cluster-connections&gt;</font></b>
</pre>

<p>
I'll have more to say about <code>message-load-balancing</code> later.
You'll probably want to configure your <i>clients</i> to know about
the mesh as well. Again, Artemis provides a number of discovery 
mechanisms, allowing clients to determine the network topology without
additional configuration. These don't work with all wire protocols
(notably, there is no discovery mechanism for AMQP), and ActiveMQ
users are probably familiar with configuring the client's 
connection targets explicitly.
The usual mechanism is to list all the brokers in the mesh in the
client's connection URI.
</p>

<h2>Why this configuration isn't (yet) like ActiveMQ</h2>

<p>
With the configuration described above, you should have a working mesh.
That is, you should be able to connect consumers to all the nodes,
produce messages to any node, and have them routed to the appropriate
consumer. However this mesh won't behave exactly like ActiveMQ,
because <b>Artemis mesh operation is not governed by client demand</b>.
</p>

<p>
In ActiveMQ, network connectors are described as "demand forwarding".
This means that messages are accepted on a particular broker, and
remain there until a particular client requests them. If there are
no clients for a particular queue, then messages will remain on
the original broker until that situation changes. 
</p>

<p>
On Artemis, forwarding behaviour is controlled <b>by the brokers</b>, and is
only loosely associated with client load. In the example above, I set
<code>message-load-balancing=ON_DEMAND</code>. This instructs the brokers
not to forward messages for specific queues to brokers where there are,
at present, no consumers for those queues. So if there are no consumers
connected at all, then the routing behaviour is similar to that of
ActiveMQ: messages will accumulate on the broker that originally
received them. If I had set <code>message-load-balancing=STRICT</code>
then the receiving broker would have divided the messages evenly
between the brokers that had that queue defined. With this configuration,
the presence of absence of clients would be irrelevant. Except...
</p>

<p>
It isn't quite that simple, and the complication can sometimes be important.
Even with <code>STRICT</code> load balancing, brokers won't forward
messages to other brokers that don't even know about the queue. If
queues are administratively defined, then all brokers "know about" all
queues, and will accept messages for them in <code>STRICT</code> mode.
If they are auto-created by clients, and there are no clients for a specific
queue, then a producer on <code>broker1</code> could send a message for
a queue that was not known on <code>broker2</code>. As a result, messages
would never be forwarded. In short: <b>whether a queue is defined
administratively or auto-created makes a difference</b>. There is no
such difference in message distribution behaviour in ActiveMQ, because it is
driven by client demand.
</p>

<p>
Even with <code>ON_DEMAND</code> load balancing, the behaviour is not
the same as ActiveMQ. A particular difference is that message distribution
decisions are made <i>when the message arrives</i>. It is at that point
that the broker will see what clients are connected, and route the message
as it deems appropriate. If there are no clients for a specific queue
<i>at that time</i> then the message will not be routed.
</p>

<p>
What this means is that if a client that is connected to <code>broker1</code>
goes down for some reason, and then reconnects, it will not receive any
of the messages that it might have expected. Even if there are no other clients
for that queue on any other broker, the message will not be routed
from its original location. It's too late -- the routing decision has
already been made.
</p>

<p>
This is a particular problem for broker installations that are behind a
load balancer or similar proxy. There's usually no way of knowing which
broker a client will ultimately connect to, because the load balancer
will make that decision. But if a client has the bad fortune to get 
connected to a broker that had never hosted that client before, then
no messages will be routed to it, even if it subscribes to a queue that
has messages on some other broker. To fix this problem, we need
<i>message redistribution</i>.
</p>

<h2>Using message redistribution</h2>

<p>
ActiveMQ has no need for a message redistribution mechanism, because all
message flow over the network connectors is coordinated by client 
demand. As we've seen, this is not the case for Artemis, where all 
message distribution is controlled by the brokers. In the usual run
of events, distribution decisions are made when messages arrive, and
are irrevocable. 
</p>
<p>
Artemis does have a way to redistribute messages after that point,
but it is not enabled by default. The relevant setting is
made on a specific address, or group of addresses, like this:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">  <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;address-setting</font></b> <font color="#009900">match</font><font color="#990000">=</font><font color="#FF0000">"#"</font><b><font color="#0000FF">&gt;</font></b>
    <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;redistribution-delay&gt;</font></b>1000<b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;/redistribution-delay&gt;</font></b>
    ...
  <b><font color="#0000FF">&lt;/address-setting&gt;</font></b>
</pre>

<p>
The default value for <code>redistribution-delay</code> is "-1", meaning
"do not redistribute". The value is in milliseconds. This is the length
of time for which a broker will leave messages on a specific address
that has no consumer,
before sending them somewhere else. 
</p>
<p>
It probably creates less load on the broker and the network, if the
redistribution delay is seconds or minutes, rather than milliseconds. 
</p>

<h2>Why this configuration still isn't (exactly) like ActiveMQ</h2>

<p>
If you set an <code>ON_DEMAND</code> load balancing policy, and enable
message redistribution with a relatively short delay, then the broker
mesh will largely look to clients as an ActiveMQ mesh looks. There
are a number of subtle differences, however, and it's impossible to
get <i>exactly</i> the same behaviour that ActiveMQ implements.
</p>
<p>
A particular problem involves message selectors. If a client subscribes
to a queue using a selector, it expects to receive only messages
that match the selector. But what happens if different clients subscribe
to the same queue, with different selectors, on different brokers? 
</p>
<p>
This is a rather subtle problem, but it's one that does arise. 
Artemis forwards messages according to whether there are consumers,
not according to whether there are selectors. So there's every chance
that messages will get forwarded to a broker whose consumers will not
match the selector. These messages will never be consumed.
</p>
<p>
This isn't specifically an Artemis problem: the use of selectors is
somewhat problematic with a broker mesh, regardless of the implementation.
Using selectors with a mesh isn't entirely robust on ActiveMQ, either: 
the broker has to maintain a "selector cache" to keep track of which
selectors are active on which queues. Because it's impossible for the broker
to know when clients will come and go, the selector cache has to maintain
tracking data for an extended period of time -- perhaps indefinitely. 
This creates a memory burden and, as a result, there are different selector 
cache implementations available, with different properties. 
</p>
<p>
Artemis does not use selector caches, because it side-steps the issue
of selector handling altogether. Unless your clients are configured
to consume from all brokers concurrently (which isn't a bad idea, in many
applications), it's just not safe to use selectors. There are a number
of other broker features that don't work properly in a mesh, and didn't
work properly with ActiveMQ, either. The most troublesome is message
grouping: this doesn't work at all in an Artemis mesh. It worked partially
with ActiveMQ, but wasn't robust in the event of a client or broker
outage. "Exclusive consumers" are also problematic, on both brokers.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
Artemis uses a completely different strategy for message distribution from
ActiveMQ, for message distribution in a broker mesh. 
Understanding how Artemis works in this respect
should go a long way to determining what changes need to me made, to
move from ActiveMQ to Artemis.
</p>
<p>
In particular, use the <code>ON_DEMAND</code> load balancing policy, and
ensure that message redistribution is enabled. Some tuning may be needed
to find the best redistribution delay for a particular application.
</p>
<p>
However, an Artemis broker mesh will never be <i>exactly</i> like an
ActiveMQ broker mesh, and this something that system integrators need
to bear in mind.
