<h1>Container from scratch: Using cgroups to manage process resources</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/tuxes.png" 
  alt="Tux logo"/>
This first article in the "container from scratch" series describes
how kernel control groups allow resources to be managed in a
collection of containers.
</p>
<p>
The ability to control the resources -- CPU, memory, threads, etc --
assigned to a group of processes is a central feature of container-based
operation. As a minimum, we need to be able to prevent one 
container starving another of resources. More subtly, we may want
to give some containers priority over other, according to the needs
of the application. This article describes how to achieve this 
management of resources using <i>control groups</i>, usually 
abbreviated to 'cgroups'.
</p>
<p>
In order to make the basic principles clear, I will demonstrate the
use of cgroups for control of memory allocation, using only command-line operations
on the files in <code>/sys/fs/cgroups</code>. </p>


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Control groups, cgroups, are the backbone of Linux container resource 
management.
They allow processes to be assigned to named groups, each of which 
has particular resource limitations. Processes can be added to
groups explicitly, and we will have to do that for at least one
process. However, what makes cgroups so powerful is that any threads a
process creates, and any new processes it spawns, automatically become
part of the same group. So, within the container, all processes will be
subject to the same resource management constraints. 
</p>
<p>
Many kinds of resource can be subject to regulation using cgroups. 
Probably the most important in container implementation are CPU share
and memory. In the following demonstration I will control only 
memory -- mostly because it's easier to see the effects than 
it is with other kinds of resource.
</p>
<p>
Control groups are well documented -- <code>man cgroups</code> will 
provide a lot of detail, although it isn't necessarily easy to follow.
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>In the following, I use the symbol $ to denote a command that should be run by a regular user, and # for a command that needs to be run by a privileged user, typically root. Of course, you can use <code>sudo</code> for these commands if you prefer.</blockquote>

<h2>Demonstration</h2>

<p>
The following demonstration shows how to restrict memory allocated to
a process and all its sub-processes. Begin by ensuring the cgroups
support is enabled, by checking that <code>/sys/fs/cgroup</code> is mounted.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">$ mount | grep cgroup | grep tmpfs
tmpfs on /sys/fs/cgroup type tmpfs (ro,nosuid,nodev,noexec,seclabel,mode=755)
</pre>

<p>
The <code>memory</code> subdirectory may exist, or may not, depending
on your Linux installation. If this directory is not present, mount
it:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"># mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/memory
# mount -t cgroup -o memory cgroup_memory /sys/fs/cgroup/memory
</pre>

<p>
Make a new memory group into which the restricted processes will be placed:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"># mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/mycontainer
</pre>

<p>
Note that all these operations on <code>/sys/fs/cgroup</code> require
a privileged user.
</p>

<p>
Request a memory limit of 5Mb for the <code>mycontainer</code> group: 
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"># echo 5000000 &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/mycontainer/memory.limit_in_bytes
</pre>

<p>
You can check that the actual limit like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"># cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/mycontainer/memory.limit_in_bytes
4997120
</pre>

<p>
Note that the actual limit is a little smaller than the one requested -- the
kernel will round it down to a multiple of its page size.
</p>

<p>
Now start a new terminal session (e.g., open a new terminal window).
This new session will represent the container whose resources are
to be restricted.
In the new session, get the shell's
process ID:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">$ echo $$
26900
</pre>

<p>
Of course, it's highly unlike that you will see the same process ID; 
substitute the real process ID in the following steps.
</p>

<p>
In the original session, add the news session's shell to the 
<code>mycontainer</code> group, by writing it's 
process ID to <code>cgroup.procs</code>:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"># echo 26900 &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/mycontainer/cgroup.procs 
</pre>

<p>
Check the processes in the <code>mycontainer</code> group:
<p/>

<pre class="codeblock"># cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/mycontainer/cgroup.procs 
26900
</pre>

<p>
There's just the one process, as expected. You can also check a 
process's group membership using <code>ps</code>:
<p/>

<pre class="codeblock"># ps -o cgroup 26900
2:memory:/mycontainer,1:name=elogind:/1
</pre>

<p>
Note that the process is in memory group <code>mycontainer</code> as expected.
</p>

<p>
Although it isn't obvious in this example, when a specific process is
moved into a particular control group, all threads in that
process will move with it.
</p>

<p>
Now, back in the 'container' terminal, run a sub-shell: 
<p>

<pre class="codeblock">$ bash
$
</pre>

<p>
and show the new shell's process ID:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">$ echo $$
27338
</pre>

<p>
Again, you're unlikely to see the same process ID, so substitute yours
in the steps below. Now check the members of the group <code>mycontainer</code> 
again:
<p>

<pre class="codeblock"># cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/mycontainer/cgroup.procs 
26900
27338
</pre>

<p>
Note that there are now two processes in the memory control group 
-- the original
<code>bash</code> shell (26900), and the sub-shell it spawned (27338).
In general, any process spawned by the original shell will be in the
same control groups -- not just for memory, but for all resources.
</p>

Now check the memory used by the <code>mycontainer</code> group of
processes:

<pre class="codeblock"># cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/mycontainer/memory.usage_in_bytes 
3182592
</pre>

<p>
We're already pretty close to the 5Mb (approx) limit. 
</p>

<p>
Now copy the following C code to a file called <code>memory_eater.c</code>. 
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><i><font color="#9A1900">// A trivial program to test how much memory a process can allocate using</font></i>

  <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
</pre>

<p>
This simple program just allocates memory in 4kB blocks for as long
as it can. With or without a memory resource limit, it will fail 
eventually. 
</p>

<p>
Compile the program using <code>gcc</code>:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">$ gcc -o memory_eater memory_eater.c
</pre>

<p>
Note that if you're running this command in the shell whose memory has been 
restricted, you might find <code>gcc</code> very slow, or it might even fail.
In that case, use a different session, or increase the memory
limit. The output of the compiler will be an executable called
<code>memory_eater</code>.
</p>
<p>
Now, in the session whose memory has been restricted, run the 'memory eater'
program. It will produce a lot of output, but it will begin and end as 
follows:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">$ ./memory_eater
malloc() OK 4096 bytes
...
malloc() OK 886104064 bytes
Killed
</pre>

<p>
The program eventually failed, as we see. However, there are two 
important things to note here. 
</p>

<p>
First, in my test, the allocations succeeded until 88Mb was allocated.
This might be different
on your system, but it's likely to be higher than the despite the 50 Mb limit
in the cgroup. Second, the <code>malloc()</code> call
always appeared to succeed (that is, it returned a non-zero value), 
even though the
process eventually got killed for lack of memory.
</p>

<p>
Both these findings are typical of Linux, when using C programs linked with
<code>glibc</code> (i.e., just about every application you're likely to
encounter). The <code>glibc</code> implementation of <code>malloc()</code> is
optimistic: it will appear to succeed even when there is no more memory
available.  The amount of memory that gets allocated before the program fails
is the result of a race between the <code>memory_eater</code> program itself,
and the Linux out-of-memory monitor. 
</p>

<p>
As an aside: in introductory C programming classes we usually teach 
students to check the return value from <code>malloc()</code> to 
ensure that the allocation succeeded. You can see that this is largely
fruitless when developing for Linux -- there's actually no way to tell
simply from the <code>malloc()</code> result whether the allocation
succeeded or not.
</p>

<p>
The significant point to take away from this discussion is that out-of-memory 
failures are
often not clean -- few Linux applications will output a clear "I am out
of memory" message: they will just stop. Still, the 5Mb memory limit
imposed by cgroups <i>is</i> being respected -- it's just not clear in the
behaviour of the test program.
</p>

<p>
You might find that some applications behave completely different in
conditions of memory starvation: they might block, for example.
If I try to run LibreOffice from the shell with the memory restriction,
it just hangs. It will resume if the limit is raised sufficiently.
In addition, if you're running tests of this kind on a desktop system, be aware
that running a command does not necessarily do all the work in
the same session. For example, if I run:

<pre class="codeblock">$ firefox
</pre>

<p>
it might succeed, despite the memory limitation. That's because the
<code>firefox</code> invocation is just signalling an existing instance of
Firefox to open a new window or tab. That existing instance is
not subject to the memory limitation.
</p>

<h2>Other resources</h2>
<p>
Similar considerations to those above apply to the regulation of 
allocated CPU resources. 
However, there are a number of subtleties here, and it's a lot
harder to demonstrate CPU control with simple command-line tests than 
it is for memory. You can control how
many CPU cores are assigned to threads, what fraction of CPU time
is allocated, and so on. It also possible, using different controllers
to restrict the number of threads or processes that a particular
process can spawn -- as we can do with <code>ulimit</code>, but 
with more fine-grained control.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
The foregoing demonstration illustrated how easy it is to manage
the resources assigned to particular processes, which is a key
feature of container management.
</p>
<p>
In practice, administrators probably won't manage control groups by
manipulating the files in <code>/sys/fs/cgroup</code> directory -- there
are many tools and libraries that simplify the administrative work.
However, there's no better way to understand the implementation than
to work at this low level.
