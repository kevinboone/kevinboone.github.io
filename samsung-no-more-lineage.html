<h1 id="no-more-lineage-os-on-samsung-cellphones">No more Lineage OS on
Samsung cellphones</h1>
<p><img src="img/lineage_logo.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>My strategy for evicting Google from my technological life includes
running alternative operating systems on my cellphones. I’ve used
several of these ‘custom ROMs’, but mostly I’ve settled on <a
href="install_lineageos.html">Lineage OS</a> or, occasionally, <a
href="lineageos-eos.html">/e/OS</a>. Nearly all of my drawer-full of
cellphone handsets are Samsung devices. I like them because the have SD
card slots, and many still have proper headphone jacks. They can also be
great value to buy second-hand.</p>
<p>Sadly, the days of running Lineage OS – and <em>any</em> non-vendor
firmware – on Samsung handsets appear to be drawing to a close, at least
in the UK. Most likely other regions will soon be affected, if they
aren’t already. Data services seem to be OK for now, but voice services
are becoming increasingly erratic.</p>
<h2 id="why-there-is-a-problem">Why there is a problem</h2>
<p>Until the roll-out of 4G technology, voice services used protocols
that were specific to mobile telephony. They’re well-understood, and
there are open-source implementations of these protocols in Android.</p>
<p>Voice services in the pre-4G world <em>don’t</em> use general data
protocols like TCP/IP, as almost all information services now do.
Increasingly, voice services use these data protocols, too, which is
where the problem starts.</p>
<p>4G services carry voice using a protocol called <em>Voice over
LTE</em>, or VoLTE. ‘LTE’ is the data-carrying specification for 4G
(sorry: I’m simplifying all this a little, because I don’t want to give
a lecture on telephony). VoLTE puts the digitized voice signal into a
regular data stream, along with web browser traffic and all the rest of
it, rather than using a custom protocol. Working this way does offer
certain advantages, but it has costs, too.</p>
<p>For the record, VoLTE is part of a set of specifications called
<em>Internet Media Services</em>, or IMS.</p>
<p>IMS is also well-understood, albeit rather complex and there are,
again, open-source implementations in Android. Most handset vendors use
these open-source implementations. The most notable exception is
Samsung.</p>
<p>In its stock handset firmware, Samsung uses a proprietary
implementation of VoLTE, to accompany its proprietary radio. Details of
this radio are, so far, not well-known enough for the maintainers of
alternative firmware to be able to implement VoLTE on it. Even if the
information were available, implementation would likely be colossally
difficult.</p>
<p>All this means that Lineage OS, and all the other non-vendor,
community firmware, can’t do VoLTE on Samsung handsets. This means
<em>they can’t use 4G technology for</em> <em>voice
communication</em>.</p>
<p>The Lineage OS maintainer are well aware of the problem, and have
been for some years. On their Samsung pages they say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While it [ie., IMS] certainly is a standard, there is no standard
implementation for it in the Android source code. Some vendors have
their own implementation, which is not open-source and can therefore not
be integrated into LineageOS’ code. Devices that rely on any of these
implementations therefore lack all the features provided by IMS (VoLTE,
VoWiFi, VoNR, etc.). This might or might not affect you, depending on
your provider and region</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sadly, this laconic note understates the seriousness of the
situation.</p>
<p>It’s worth bearing in mind, before putting too much blame on custom
firmware, that many completely stock Android handsets don’t support
VoLTE properly, either. Most likely there will be problems with any
device more than about three years old. The difference, however, is that
<em>modern</em> Samsung devices will work with Samsung firmware, but
they’ll probably never work with anything else.</p>
<h2 id="why-its-a-problem-now-in-the-uk">Why it’s a problem <em>now</em>
(in the UK)</h2>
<p>Although we’ve seen this problem coming, in most regions the lack of
VoLTE support hasn’t been a show-stopper until this year, because of the
continued availability of 2G and 3G services. Cellphones will switch to
these services if they can’t use 4G – so long as they continue to
exist.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of the world is gradually shutting down its 3G
services. In the UK, most operators shut down 3G in 2024. O2 continued
until April of 2025 so, as an O2 customer, I was sheltered from the
worst effects of the shut-down for longer than many. However, with these
services now gone, and with no access to 4G voice services, my Samsung
handsets have become increasingly erratic.</p>
<p>They can still fall back on 2G services, but these also are becoming
patchy. I can still make voice calls from the top floor of my house but,
as I walk downstairs, there’s a point where audio shuts off, even though
the call is notionally still active. I guess that’s the point at which
I’ve passed out of range of whichever mast is still providing the
vestigial 2G service.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-know-whether-you-have-this-problem">How do you know
whether you have this problem?</h2>
<p>If you don’t have access to VoLTE services – either because of a
limitation in the handset or in the network – you’ll see the phone
switch to a lower grade of service when you try to make a voice
call.</p>
<p>In my region, the level of service I mostly get is EDGE (appears as
‘E’ in the signal-strength indicator), although sometimes I get GPRS
(‘G’) or HSPDA (‘H’). These are all data services associated with
2G.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The E of Doom</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This happens because, when the phone switches to one of these
services for voice, it has to use them for data as well. Irritatingly,
once the phone has switched service, it may not switch back, leading to
a degraded data performance. I’ve found that switching airplane mode on
and off restores data services, but it’s a nuisance that I have to.</p>
<p>As well as these obvious indications, there might be less obvious
effects, like poor or absent call audio, or calls being dropped.</p>
<h2 id="the-extent-of-the-problem">The extent of the problem</h2>
<p>Right now, I still get reasonable voice calling in urban areas.
Whether your de-Googled Samsung handset continues to be useable depends
on the availability of 2G services. Unfortunately these, too, are being
phased out, and in many regions (including mine) 2G provision is now
less widespread, and less reliable, than 4G. Mobile operators have
little incentive to keep these archaic services running. Complaining to
your network that you have unacceptable voice calling over 2G doesn’t
get much traction.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-be-done">What can be done?</h2>
<p>At this point, sadly, probably nothing. It’s unlikely that Samsung
will release the source code for its VoLTE implementation, and there’s
little enthusiasm for reverse-engineering it. Those of us who want to
use a cellphone that isn’t a pocket data siphon will have to find
alternative vendors. Ironically, Google Pixel handsets seem to offer the
best VoLTE support, and are likely to be the best bet in future.</p>
<h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h2>
<p>I have to stress that this article applies only to Samsung handsets.
If you’re using a Sony or Motorola device, you’re probably OK. What’s
unfortunate is that Samsung handsets are popular with de-Googlers,
because they lend themselves to off-line operation. Google’s Pixel
phones have limited storage, because Google wants you to store all your
data on their servers. That’s exactly the situation that we’re trying to
avoid.</p>
<p>My long-term plan is to get away from smartphones entirely. The day I
do that might be closer than I thought.</p>
