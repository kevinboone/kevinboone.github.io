<h1 id="fun-with-capital-letters">Fun with capital letters</h1>
<p><img src="img/report.png" class="article-top-image" /> This article
is about the use and misuse of capital letters in English writing. Like
the use of <a href="apostrophe.html">apostrophes</a>, there’s a level of
disagreement on this topic that some writers might find surprising.
Still, there are certain conventions and, if you want your writing to be
taken seriously, it’s as well to know what they are.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note</em><br />
Nothing in this article applies to poetry. In poetry, you can do as you
please.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="general-principle">General principle</h2>
<p>There are a few places where all serious writers use capital letters.
Then there are some places where capitalization is a matter of style,
and different publications have their own rules. If you can’t articulate
a reason to use a capital letter in a particular place, don’t use one.
If in doubt, it’s nearly always better to miss out a capital letter,
than to use one where it isn’t needed.</p>
<h2 id="the-word-i">The word ‘I’</h2>
<p>Everybody capitalizes the word ‘I’ (referring to oneself). It’s one
of the few places where all writers seem to agree.</p>
<h2 id="the-starts-of-sentences-headings-titles-and-captions">The starts
of sentences, headings, titles, and captions</h2>
<p>Almost every writer starts every sentence with a capital letter. It’s
an important way to make reading more fluent. Headings, titles, and
captions, while not strictly sentences, usually start with a capital
letter. Some writers may capitalize other words in headings and titles –
more on that point later.</p>
<h2 id="proper-nouns">Proper nouns</h2>
<p><em>Proper nouns</em> are the names of people, countries, days and
months, products, and many other things. Writing personal names (“Fred
Bloggs”) without capital letters is an affectation. It’s a myth that the
poet EE Cummings wrote his name without capitals – but his publishers
did. It’s striking to see a personal name written that way, because it’s
so unusual.</p>
<p>Except for personal names, there’s no universal agreement about what
constitutes a proper noun – it’s a surprisingly difficult concept to
define exactly. We almost always capitalize names of countries and
specific places, along with months and days. In my youth we wrote
“Summer” and “Autumn” (or “Fall”), but capitals here are out of fashion
now.</p>
<p>Personal titles are usually capitalized <em>when they refer to a
specific person</em>, or are used in a address. So we have “The Prime
Minister said today…”, but “The duties of a prime minister are…” The
first refers to the individual, the second to the office. But it’s not
uncommon to see “Prime Minister” and “Lord Chancellor” and so on, even
when they don’t refer to an individual. We usually write “Yes,
Minister?” because “Minister” here is an address to a specific
individual.</p>
<p>Product names usually get capitals, but some product names can also
be common words or phrases. In that case, they should probably not be
capitalized except when referring to the product. “Personal Computer” is
a product originally made by IBM, but “personal computer” could apply to
any small computer. It’s probably polite to write “iPhone” rather than
“IPhone”, despite the irregular capitalization, because Apple does.</p>
<p>Names of events and holidays are often capitalized (“Christmas”,
“Easter”). Practices vary for names that are long, and made up of common
words. Do we need to capitalize every word in “East Dogpatch Annual
Cheese-Rolling Competition”? Maybe not.</p>
<p>There are many, many edge cases in this area but, on the whole, it’s
usually clear whether a noun is a name, and needs its capital. When it
isn’t clear, it’s probably because there simply isn’t a right answer.
Was there a “Cuban Missile Crisis” or a “Cuban missile crisis”? Both
variants are in widespread use, and it’s difficult to say that either is
‘wrong’.</p>
<h2 id="pronouns">Pronouns</h2>
<p>Other than “I” we almost never capitalize pronouns in English, unless
they have to be capitalized for some other reason – they begin a
sentence, for example. A historic exception is the use of “He” and “His”
to refer to God. While standard in my schooldays, even very devout
writers don’t seem to write this way now. The practice hasn’t completely
faded away, however.</p>
<h2 id="abbreviations">Abbreviations</h2>
<p>We almost always use capital letter for abbreviations (“USA”, “UFO”).
Increasingly, writers are turning away from capitalizing acronyms
(abbreviations that can be read as words) that amount to novel words,
like “scuba”, “nimby”, and “yuppie”.</p>
<p>Acronyms that amount to common words are usually still capitalized,
whether they are pronounced as words or not. So we still have “NICE”
rather than “nice”.</p>
<h2 id="words-derived-from-proper-nouns">Words derived from proper
nouns</h2>
<p>We’re moving into greyer areas from this point on.</p>
<p>While nearly everybody uses capital letters on nearly every proper
noun (leaving aside oddities like “iPhone”), there’s less agreement on
whether to use capitals on ‘proper adjectives’. For example, we write
“England”, but what about “English”? Does it matter whether it’s
“English people”, the “the English language”, or “the full English”?
What about nouns derived from proper nouns – is it “Englishmen” or
“englishmen”?</p>
<p>What if a proper noun is not at the <em>start</em> of a word, but
elsewhere in the word. Would you describe a person’s behaviour as
“unEnglish”, or “unenglish”, or “un-English”? It’s an ugly word, with or
without capitals, but there are plenty of similar examples.</p>
<p>What if the word is a derogatory one? Should we write “Balkanization”
or “balkanization?”</p>
<p>Where words are variants of a proper noun, most writers will use a
capital letter unless the result would be ugly (which is, of course,
subjective), but it’s far from universal. It seems to me that writers
are strict about capitalizing words derived from proper nouns when the
words have most of their letters in common: “England” and “English” both
start with “Engl-”. But I often see “martian” (“Are we going to be
invaded by martians?”) rather than “Martian”. “Mars” is the name of
something, and “Martian” seems more accurate to me. But “Venus” is a
name, and we don’t usually write “Venereal” when talking about disease.
Of course, many people don’t know that “Venereal” is derived from
“Venus”.</p>
<p>In short, most writers seem to capitalize words derived from proper
nouns when the connection between the words is very clear, and they are
spelled similarly. The less obvious the connection, the less the
compulsion to capitalize.</p>
<h2 id="abbreviated-and-referential-names">Abbreviated and referential
names</h2>
<p>Many writers capitalize part of a name, even if that part is just a
common word or phrase. “National Health Service” is a name, but it’s
often abbreviated to “the Health Service”, or even just “the Service”.
Similarly, if I’m writing about East Dogpatch Hospital, it would be fine
to write “The Hospital has 300 beds…” if “Hospital” is a short form of
“East Dogpatch Hospital”. But it would also be perfectly acceptable to
write “The hospital…” in the same circumstances – “hospital” itself,
after all, does not name anything.</p>
<p>A related problem is whether to capitalize common words that
<em>stand for</em> names.</p>
<p>For example, “Surrey” is the name of a county in England (and
elsewhere), and would always be capitalized. It’s less clear whether to
capitalize “County” in “The County of Surrey”. “Surrey County” is
definitely a name, and deserves its capitals. “County of Surrey” is less
obviously a name, but I suspect most writers would capitalize “County”
here.</p>
<p>“County”, of course, is not a name in itself. But there was a time
when it would have been capitalized when used as a reference to some
specific county. So, for example: “I live in Surrey, and the authorities
in the County have decided…”</p>
<p>Similarly: “Are you going to the Company meeting today?” At school I
would have capitalized “Company” if it was referring to a specific
company, even if I had not mentioned that Company (see, I did it again).
We capitalized words like this if the context made it clear that they
were references to specific, named entities, whether we used the names
or not.</p>
<p>Almost anything that is unique can have references like this. Nearly
always it would be odd to capitalize them. I wouldn’t capitalize
“Friend” in “I have a friend called Fred”. The problem with this kind of
capitalization is that it tends to leak: you could probably find a
justification to capitalize <em>anything</em> on the grounds that it’s a
reference to a named entity.</p>
<p>Consequently, when I was at school, we had a huge list of words that
should be capitalized when used to refer to a specific person or thing.
I couldn’t remember it then, and I can’t remember it now. In general,
it’s probably best to avoid using capitalization this way, and it’s a
capitalization practice that definitely seems to be on the decline.</p>
<h2 id="headings-and-captions">Headings and captions</h2>
<p>Until about fifty years ago, it was conventional to capitalize most
of the words in a heading, however long it was. We almost never
capitalized conjunctions (“and”, “but”…) or articles (“the”, “an”…)
unless they began the sentence, but we capitalized everything else.</p>
<p>I don’t think anybody would consider it <em>wrong</em> to do this
now, but it’s less popular, even in the most formal publications.
<em>The Times</em> no longer capitalizes article headings, but it
<em>does</em> capitalize section headings (e.g., “Life &amp;
Style”).</p>
<p>If you’re writing for a specific publication, the publishers will
almost certainly have rules about capitalization of headings.</p>
<h2 id="titles">Titles</h2>
<p>I’m sure most (all?) writers would write at least the first word of a
title with a capital; beyond that, it’s not so clear. Capitalizing
“Breaking Bad” looks fine, but all the capitals in “Doctor Strangelove:
How I Stopped Worrying and Learned To Love the Bomb” are overpowering.
The good thing about capitalizing all the words in a title is that it
makes it stand out from the rest of the sentence. However, we can get
the same effect these days using text styles. My personal preference is
to use italic text for titles, and only capitalize the first word.</p>
<h2 id="starts-of-clauses">Starts of clauses</h2>
<p>Everybody starts a sentence with a capital letter, but there’s no
general agreement on whether to capitalize the first word of a clause
that is short of a whole sentence.</p>
<p>For example: there’s no particular reason to capitalize the first
word after a colon. But many writers do, and the practice is definitely
on the increase. I don’t usually use capitals after colons when writing
for myself, but some of the publications I’ve written for – particularly
in the US – require me to.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>There’s no good reason to sprinkle capital letters all over your
text. If you capitalize the word “I”, names, abbreviations, and the
first word of each sentence, your work will be perfectly readable. If
you capitalize anything else, you should be able to explain why.</p>
