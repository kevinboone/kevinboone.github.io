<h1>Converting a floating-point number to a fraction (approximately) using continued fraction expansion</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/integral.jpg" 
  alt="integral sign"/>
</p>
<p>
This article describes how to convert a double-precision floating-point
number to a fraction, within a specified tolerance. This is a commonplace
operation, in computing operations and in day-to-day life. For example,
in carpentry and construction it's often helpful to know that <i>pi</i>
can be approximated to two decimal places as 22/7, or to five decimal
places as 355/113. Both these numbers can be used in back-of-the-envelope
calculations (or even in your head, if you have good concentration)
in a way that "3.1415926" can't. It's often helpful to rationalize
the result of a calculation, because it can give an insight into 
the meaning of the result that a decimal number to ten decimal places can't.  
</p>
<p>
Algorithms and code samples for rationalizing a decimal number abound.
However, they are rarely well-explained, so limitations
in their use are not apparent. In this article I will describe the
use of <i>continued fractions</i> to rationalize a number, and I will
explain it from first principles. 
</p>
<p>
The code examples in this article are in C, but I think the basic
principles should be comprehensible to people familiar with other 
programming languages. See the Download section
at the end of the article for a link to the source full source
code for the examples.
</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>
Given a decimal number (say, 1.625) convert it into a fraction
(1 5/8), or an improper fraction (13/8). The conversion should yield
a fraction with the smallest total number of digits, within the bounds
of a particular precision. 
</p>


<h2>Basic principles</h2>
<p>
A real number (in the mathematical analysis sense) cannot necessarily
be converted into a fraction, except by accepting some inaccuracy.
For example, the number <i>sqrt(2)</i> is <i>irrational</i> -- 
by definition, it can't be rationalized. 
</p>
<p>
For a floating-point number stored in a computer, this is <i>not true</i>.
A floating-point number can always be rationalized, because there is only
such much precision in the computer representation. 
</p>
<p>
For example, the number "0.124456432" can be rationalized very easily
as 124456432 / 10000000000. The problem is that this probably isn't a
very <i>useful</i> rationalization -- it doesn't tell us anything new. On the
other hand, with a precision of 8 digits, the rationalization is
2261 / 18167. Whether this is a more useful representation depends, I 
suppose, on whether either the numerator or denominator are 
recognizable in their own right.   
</p>
<p>
However, if we rationalize with a three-figure precision, we see that
0.124456432 is, in fact, 1 / 8. If the decimal number came from a calculation
involving measurements, it's quite likely that "1 / 8" is the "correct"
answer, and all the other digits are just from the measurement error. 
</p>
<p>
So this problem really isn't just a matter of rationalizing a decimal
number -- which is trivial with floating-point numbers; it's about
finding the most appropriate representation: that is, the rationalization
that uses the smallest number of digits that is compatible with a specified
precision.
</p>
<p>
To perform this task we will use <i>continued fractions</i>. We will
find the smallest set of continued fraction coefficients that represents
the original number (within the specified precision), and then convert
that continued fraction to an ordinary fraction. Both these processes
are conceptually straightforward, but there are complications related
to computational accuracy that have to be addressed. 
</p>

<h2>Continued fractions</h2>
<p>
A continued fraction is a fraction of this form.
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
    a + 1
        -----------
        b + 1
            -------
            c + 1
                ---
                ...
</pre>

<p>
The concept appears to
have been developed by ancient Greek mathematicians, for specifying
numbers of arbitrary precision. For some reason, the modern concept of
a decimal number seems not to have occurred to them; or perhaps was not
considered interesting enough.
</p>

<p>
The fraction can continue indefinitely, to provide whatever precision
is required. The terms a, b, c, etc., are referred to as the
<i>coefficients</i> of the fraction. To save space, these days a continued 
fraction is usually written in a compact form:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
[a; b, c, ...]
</pre>

<p>
There are well-developed methods to convert a decimal
number into a continued fraction; and there are well-developed
methods to convert a continued fraction to a normal fraction. So,
to convert a decimal number to a normal fraction, we can first convert
to a continued fraction, and then to a normal fraction. In practice,
we'll do these two steps together in a loop, to avoid the need to
store any intermediate results.
</p>

<h2>Converting a decimal number to a continued fraction</h2>
<p>
The algorithm for converting from a decimal number to a continued fraction
is simple, but let's see a specific example first. Let's convert
1.75 to a continued fraction. The final result will be:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
   1 +  1
         ----------
         1 + 1
             -
             3
</pre>

<p>
In the more compact representation, we might write this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
[1; 1, 3]
</pre>

<p>
Note that this representation (in decimal arithmetic) is <i>exact</i>.
If we tried to find any more coefficients, they would all be zero. We
only need three coefficients to represent 1.75 precisely. In practice, 
though, we will often want to stop the extraction of coefficients when
the result is already within the specified precision. Remember that the
problem to be solved amounts to finding the smallest numerator and
denominator, with a particular precision. 
</p>

<p>
The first coefficient of the continued fraction is is 1 --
just the whole-number part of 1.75. So we extract that as the
first coefficient, leaving 0.75. Now we want to represent 0.75
as a fraction and, in the continued fraction formulation, the numerator
is always 1. So:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
  0.75 = 1 / denominator;
  denominator = 1/0.75 = 1.333...
</pre>

<p>
Notice that the result is a recurring decimal in base 10 (and might be
in other number bases as well). It can only be represented approximately. 
The errors involved in doing repeated computations on numbers with
limited precision is something I'll come back to later. 
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the second coefficient is 1, the whole-number part of 1.3333...,
leaving 0.333.... Continuing:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
  0.333 = 1 / denominator;
  denominator = 3.000
</pre>

<p>
This denominator is a whole number, 3, which means that we're done, and
the final coefficient is 3.
The C code that most closely represents the procedure I described
above is the following, using floating-point arithmetic throughout. 
The variable <i>a</i> represents the extracted continued fraction
coefficient.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
  double x = ... // Number to be converted
  double a = floor (x); // First coefficient
  while (x - floor (x) < something)
    {
    x = 1 / (x - a);
    a = floor (x); // Subsequent coefficients
    }
</pre>

<p>
The "something" in the code above is a term that represents the precision 
we're aiming for, and will usually be a number that is much smaller than
the number we're converting. 
</p>

<h2>Converting the continued fraction to a normal fraction</h2>

<p>
We could store the continued fraction coefficients in an array, and use any of
the well-documented
methods to convert from a continued fraction to a normal fraction.
However, we don't need to store them, because the method of "left-to-right
expansion" of the continued fraction allows us to build the 
final result incrementally, working through
the coefficients from left to right. Since we are <i>generating</i> them from
left to right, we can do the expansion at the same time we generate the
coefficients; no need to store anything but the last few values.
</p>

<p>
To understand how left-to-right expansion works, let's write some
sequences of coefficients in full, and compare them.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
   [a]     a
   [a;b]   a+1/b, or (ab +1)/b
   [a;b,c] a + 1/(b + 1/c), or a + c/(bc + 1), or (c(ab + 1) + a)/(cb + 1)
</pre>

<p>
I've written the expansions in such a way that each is expressed in
terms of a numerator and a denominator. There is a pattern here. 
</p>
<p>
Notice that the expansion of [a; b,c] has a numerator c(ab + 1) + a 
and a denominator
cb + 1. <i>Each of these terms can be made from terms in the previous
continued fraction expansion</i>. That's the key and, if you're anything
like me, you'll have to look at the formulation for a while before
the "aha!" moment. As we increase the length of the expansion, each
new expansion needs only the current coefficient, and the numerators and 
denominators from the previous two expansions.
</p>
<p>
That is, in any iteration of the loop shown in the code snippet
above, if we call the previous numerator and denominator
n1 and n2, and likewise d1 and d2 for the denominators, then the current
approximations for the numerator and denominator are simply:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
   n = n2 + a n1
   d = d2 + a d1
</pre>

<p>
This is, to my mind at least, a surprisingly elegant and helpful
formulation, and one that I think is not immediately obvious from
looking at how continued fractions are formulated.
<p>
</p>
So, as we loop around the expansion of the original number into continued
fraction coefficients, we shift the n, n1, n2 terms "to the left", building up
a better approximation of the normal fraction as we go, using
the two expressions immediately above. Of course, the
addition and multiplication of positive numbers ensures that the
numerator and denominator can only get bigger with each new iteration;
but that is what is expected: to get the increasing accuracy, we 
need to use larger numerators and denominators.
</p>
<p>
The source code for this floating-point implementation is 
in the file <code>rationalize.1.c</code> in the
source code bundle.
</p>

<h2>What's wrong with this method?</h2>

<p>
The method described above is adequate for most practical purposes.
If you want to convert a number retaining, say, 3-5 digits
of precision, it's fine.

 For more specialist purposes, however -- if you
wanted 8-figure precision, for example, there's a problem. Well,
two problems, but they have the same cause.
</p>

<p>
The problems stem from the repeated use of floating-point numbers
in calculations. Each time a calculation is performed, some accuracy
is lost. Since the method is iterative, and results from one iteration
become the input to the next, the errors accumulate. In addition, 
floating-point math is slow. Of course, 
"slow" is a relative term and, on a modern computer, the floating-point
method will be fast enough, unless you have to convert millions of
numbers. 
</p>

<p>
What follows, therefore, might be academic. I'll describe how to
implement the algorithm entirely using integer math. 
</p>

<h2>Doing continued fraction expansion in integers</h2>

<p>
Clearly, the mathematical formulation above makes no sense in 
integer arithmetic. We can't meaningfully take the reciprocal
of an integer, or apply the <code>floor()</code> function to it.
</p>

<p>
What we can do, though, is to apply a scaling factor to the
number to be converted, and then do all the subsequent math on
the scaled number. Let's say we scale by 10,000 (but there's
nothing special about this number). What is the equivalent of
<code>floor(x)</code> in this formulation?
</p>

<p>
If we think of "floor" as "divide by 1 and discard the remainder",
we can see that in the scaled system, we can replace:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
    double x = ... // Number to be converted
    double a;
    a = floor (x); 
</pre>

<p>
with
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
    inte64_t x = // Number to be converted * 10000
    int64_t a;
    a = x / 10000; 
</pre>

<p>
The "discard the remainder" part of the operation is implicit when we
do integer division. What about the reduction operation
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
    x = 1 / (x - a);
</pre>

<p>
in the floating-point example? In principle, the scaled equivalent
ought to be:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
    x = 10000 / (x / 10000 - a)
</pre>

<p>
That won't work, however -- x / 10000 could evaluate to zero in
integer arithmetic, losing all precision. So we must
scale twice here, to ensure that x will never be less than 10000.
This gives us:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
    x = scale * scale / (x - a * scale); 
</pre>

<p>
Note that the continued fraction coefficient a is not scaled -- it's
still going to be a number less than 10. 
</p>

<p>
There's nothing special about my choice of 10,000 as the scaling factor.
However, it's not arbitrary, either. If we want to get a result
with five figures of precision, 10,000 is a good scaling factor.
Suppose the number to be converted is "3.1415926535...". When scaled and
rounded to an integer this gives us "31415". We don't need to worry 
about the loss of rest of the fractional digits, since they are below
the specified precision, anyway. The scaling factor needs to be
sufficiently large that any digits we need from the original fraction
end up in the integer.  
</p>

<p>
In the complete source code, rather than hard-coding a scaling factor,
I've allowed the user to specify the order of the conversion (that is,
the approximate number of digits of precision), and then calculated
the scaling factor:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
    int64_t scale = pow (10, order); 
</pre>

<p>
This is really the only floating-point math operation in the program, and it
could be replaced by a multiplication loop to give an all-integer-math
solution.
</p>

<p>
There is another point to note about the integer implementation. 
If we have selected, say, five digits of precision, then we never
need more than five continued fraction coefficients. So, rather than
expanding the continued fraction until we reach the required 
precision, we just expand five coefficients. We'll still need to test
whether the required precision has been reached, because that might
happen before the whole quota of coefficients has been generated.
</p>
<p>
It's worth bearing in mind that the all-integer representation can't
ever work with more than nine digits of precision. That's because
the term <code>scale * scale</code> in the computation described 
above will be too large to fit into a 64-bit integer. The method might
fail with fewer digits, too -- if the input number is large enough,
there might still be an arithmetic overflow. 
</p>
<p>
The source code for this "integer scale by power of ten" method
is implemented in the file <code>rationalize.2.c</code> in the
source code bundle.
</p>

<h2>Can we use powers of two instead of powers of ten?</h2>
<p>
In the integer-only example I described above, I suggested making
a fractional number into an integer with sufficient significant
figures simply by multiplying by a power of ten (10,000 in the 
example). But what's special about powers of ten? Nothing
really -- it's highly unlikely that the computer's floating-point
representation will be in base 10. We could have used anything
for the scaling factor, so long as it was large enough.
</p>
<p>
If we choose a power of two for the scaling factor (e.g., 65536, or
2^16), then we can re-cast most of the multiplication and division 
operations as shift-left or shift-right operations. A shift-left 
of three places, for example, is equivalent to multiplying by 
eight.
</p>
<p>
The advantage of working this way is that shift operations are hugely
less computationally expensive, and thus much faster, than 
multiplications and divisions. We can also, if we're very careful,
design an algorithm that allows high levels of precision, by
avoiding the need to use very large scaling factors. The problem
with very clever implementations is that they tend to be
machine-specific. 
</p>
<p>
The problem with using a shift-based algorithm -- other than the
tendency to be machine-specific -- is that it's difficult to 
specify the required precision in human-comprehensible terms. 
Everybody knows what it means to get an answer to three significant
figures in decimal arithmetic; it's much less obvious what a precision
in terms of binary bits amounts to.
