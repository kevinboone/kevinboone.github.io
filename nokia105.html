2nd-generation Nokia 105: a smarter dumb phone</h1>
<p><img src="img/degoogle.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>I’ve become a little disheartened recently, about how difficult it is
to use a de-Googled Android cellphone on modern 4G networks. Samsung
handsets present a particular difficulty, but support for voice-over-LTE
(VoLTE) is hit-and-miss with many vendors – even with stock firmware.
With an open-source operating system like /e/OS or Lineage, it’s even
more problematic. In my region, VoLTE is the only game in town; without
this support, I can’t make voice calls.</p>
<p><img src="img/nokia105.png" class="article-image" /></p>
<p>It’s always been my plan to wean myself off smartphones completely at
some point. I wasn’t expecting it to be today, and I can’t deny it will
be inconvenient. Still, I’ve been investigating the alternatives, and
I’ve been surprised at how good modern “dumb phones” have become.
Particularly considering how inexpensive they can be.</p>
<p>I’m currently trying out the 2nd-generation Nokia 105 4G. Although it
looks like a classic dumb phone from the 90s, it’s actually quite
capable. It’s certainly something that ought to be on a de-Googler’s
radar, anyway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
This article is about the 2024/5, 2nd-generation Nokia 105 4G, and not
the earlier models that have had similar labels. In particular, this is
most definitely <em>not</em> an Android phone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the perspective of being able to communicate, the most
impressive feature of the 105 is its hassle-free support for 4G and
VoLTE. it just worked – no set-up, not calling the carrier to find out
what arcane actions I needed to enable it. I just put in my SIM card,
and that was that.</p>
<p>Unlike 90s cellphones, this one has USB-C fast charging (although no
charger was included). It only takes minutes to charge, and a charge
seems to last forever. I think the official claim is one month on
standby and, while I haven’t had it that long, I haven’t had to charge
it again so far.</p>
<p>The 105 supports Bluetooth, both for calls and general audio
playback. Again, it was fuss-free. But – oh, bliss! – there’s a real
headphone jack as well, for those of us who prefer wires.</p>
<p>The Nokia 105 stores contacts on the SIM card, as we all used to do
before cloud storage took off. I was expecting to have to key in all my
names and numbers but, amazingly, the 105 has an Android sync feature. I
paired the 105 with my Android phone, and just waited as it copied 600+
contacts across. I don’t know if it will sync with anything other than
an Android handset – I was unable to find anything else in its menus,
but I didn’t look very hard.</p>
<p>There’s an audio/music player, which works fine, but has limited
controls. The sound quality through wired headphones is pretty good, all
things considered; over Bluetooth it’s whatever Bluetooth offers. Sadly,
the audio player has no notion of bookmarking or position memory, so
it’s pretty useless for audiobooks and podcasts – you have to listen
from the beginning every time you stop the player to make a call. It’s
better the nothing, but barely. I guess you could split a book into
chapters, each with its own file, and then you’d only have to start from
the beginning of a chapter if you lost your place. Still, it’s not a
patch on Android-based audiobook/podcast apps.</p>
<p>A further limitation in the audio support is that the 105 only
accepts SD storage of up to 32Gb. It also only accepts MP3 audio format
but, given the lack of storage, that’s probably no bad thing. 32Gb will
allow for many days of speech audio at listenable quality, which is why
it’s a shame that the audio player is so rudimentary. It will also allow
for perhaps a hundreds hours of music at 320kbps/sec bandwidth. I’ve
used it in the gym with noise-cancelling Bluetooth earbuds, and it works
just fine. It’s certainly more convenient in my pocket than a smartphone
when running or hiking.</p>
<p>There’s even a rudimentary web browser, which seems to be based on
Opera. While it works, the screen is too tiny, and the user interface
too clunky, to be useful for mainstream browsing.</p>
<p>The 105 has a whole heap of minor features, too. It supports multiple
alarms, and alarms sound even when the handset is switched completely
off. There’s an FM radio, which works fine in areas of strong signal.
There’s a file manager. There’s even a calendar, but good luck keying in
appointment details using the number keypad. There’s even the classic
90s ‘Snake’ game we all know and hate.</p>
<p>Rather irritatingly, the 105 has demo versions of other games, which
have to be purchased. There doesn’t seem to be any way to stop links to
these games appearing on the main menu, even though I have no intention
of playing any of them.</p>
<p>The Nokia 105 doesn’t have a camera, but the 110 does. Having seen
some photos it’s taken, I can’t say I’m inclined to pay extra for this
feature.</p>
<p>The very best thing, however, is the price: I paid £12.50 for my 105,
but I’ve seen if for as little as £11. How something with this feature
set can be made so cheaply, Goodness knows. Sadly, I suspect at least
part of the answer is that it’s made in a country with little respect
for employment rights. But the same is true for most of our technology
these days.</p>
<p>So do we have a smartphone replacement here?</p>
<p>In some respects, I think we do. Although the 105 is primarily a
communications device, its support for modern standards like USB C,
Bluetooth, and 4G make it a capable one. Being able to play music –
albeit with limitations – takes care of the one feature of my smartphone
that I really wouldn’t like to do without.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>We’ve all gotten used to the integrated convenience of a smartphone,
even a Luddite like me. I’m used to being able to make appointments
using my phone when I’m out, without having to carry a diary. I use my
smartphone as an alternative to printed maps all the time. I’d forgotten
the tedium of entering SMS messages using a number keypad, and I doubt I
shall learn to love it.</p>
<p>No, for all its modern touches, the Nokia 105 is no substitute for a
smartphone. Still, if (when?) it becomes impossible fully to de-Google a
regular smartphone, the Nokia 105 is the kind of device I shall be using
thereafter.</p>
<p>That won’t be ideal, but it won’t be a tragedy, either.</p>
