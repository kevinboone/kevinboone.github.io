<h1>Running CP/M on the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/terminal.png" 
  alt="terminal prompt"/>
Forty years after its heyday, the CP/M operating system -- originally
designed for 8-bit microprocessors -- is having a bit of a revival, 
as is the Z80 CPU chip it was mostly commonly used with. 
That it's still possible to buy a Z80 
IC is remarkable in itself but, astoundingly, there's a number of 
new Z80-based
products on the market. Particularly noteworthy are kits or complete
computers based on the 
 <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/159973-z80-mbc2-a-4-ics-homebrew-z80-computer" target="_blank">Z80-MBC2</a> and the 
<a href="https://rc2014.co.uk/">RC2014</a> designs. To be fair, these
products are aimed at enthusiasts, not mainstream users; but it's 
pretty amazing that they exist at all. 
</p>
<p>
I've <a href="cpm40.html">argued elsewhere</a> that these technologies
are worth keeping around -- not just for sentimental reasons
(although that's a good enough reason for many of us) but because they
demand the use of skills and knowledge that we otherwise run the risk
of losing completely. 
</p>

<p>
In this article I describe the implementation of CPICOM --
a CP/M 2.2 emulator
for the Raspberry Pi Pico. The Pico is a tiny, low-cost ARM-based
controller, with 2Mb of flash ROM and 256kB of RAM. When running
a CP/M emulator on the Pico, the overall performance is about 
the same as that of
a real Z80-based microcomputer of 1980s vintage -- pretty slow 
by contemporary measures.
</p>

<p>
The source code, and installable UF2 files, 
for CPICOM are available in
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/cpicom">my GitHub repository</a>.
</p>

<h2>How CPICOM works</h2>
<p>
CPICOM embeds a Z80 emulator written in C, that dates from the 1990s. 
There are a number of Z80 emulators around, but none was particular
easy to port to the Pico. The best-known, and probably the most
accurate, is Udo Munk's Z80pack. Unfortunately, despite a great deal
of fiddling, I couldn't make it work on the Pico. Z80pack, like most
emulators, assumes the presence of a Linux-like filesystem to store
files. The Pico has no filesystem, except the one I implemented
in the flash ROM. In the end, the emulator that seemed to offer the
best compromise between ease of porting and accuracy is
the one by Parag Patel, with extensions by Joseph Allen. The 
original source code for that
project is <a href="https://github.com/jhallen/cpm">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Of course, emulating the Z80 is not sufficient -- we also need
to emulate the CP/M API as well. The API is provided by the
BDOS and BIOS components of CP/M. CPICOM embeds a BDOS implementation
(P2DOS) in Z80 machine code, which is connected to a custom filesystem
compatibility subsystem. CPICOM provides its own command-line
interpreter, rather than the CP/M "CCP", because CCP is brutally
unfriendly -- even for a command line, and that's saying something. 
</p>

<p>
There's just enough room in the Pico's flash for the CPICOM 
program -- which comes to about 200kB of ARM code -- and two emulated 720kB
floppy disks. These form drive 0 and drive 1 in CP/M --
or "A:" and "B:" as they appear in the command prompt.
</p>

<p>
Because the Z80 emulator code is scattered with calls to C file
functions -- <code>fopen()</code>, <code>read()</code>, <code>write()</code>,
etc., CPICOM provides its own implementations of all these functions,
which map onto operations onto the emulated floppy disks.
Writing a complete file handling layer for a microntroller is no small
task, but I'm hoping that work will be useful in other applications
as well.
</p>

<p>
CPICOM is implemented in about 20,000 lines of C, and designed to be 
compiled using the Pico software development kit. 
</p>

<h2>How to use CPICOM</h2>

<p>
If you want to try CPICOM you'll need a Raspberry Pi Pico, the
UF2 firmware from my GitHub repository, and a terminal emulator. If you
want to install actual CP/M software on it -- and it's not much use
otherwise -- you'll need a terminal emulator that can send files
using the YModem protocol. This is no problem with a Linux workstation,
but it might be awkward for Windows users. I've been told that
terminal emulators for Windows are not especially capable, and it might
be easier to install the Windows Linux subsystem, and use the
old Minicom terminal emulator. Minicom is what I use, and the only 
terminal software I'm at all competent to describe.
</p>

<p>
The Pico emulates a USB storage device when it's in bootloader
mode. To get it into this mode, hold down the little button on the
Pico whilst plugging it into a computer using a USB cable. You
can then upload the UF2 file. As soon as the file is uploaded,
the Pico will start running the CP/M emulator, and the USB port
will switch over to serial mode. You can then access it using 
a terminal emulator.
</p>

<p>
The terminal emulator should show CP/M's notorious "A&gt;" prompt. 
You can run <code>dir</code> to lists the files on the A: drive, but
there won't be any this stage. There's also a B: drive, also empty.
Both these drives emulate a 720kB floppy drive. The data is
actually stored in the Pico's flash ROM, which can be written at
runtime as well as when uploading firmware.  
</p>

<p>
Detailed steps for uploading CP/M programs are in 
the <a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/cpicom/blob/main/README.md">README file on GitHub</a>. Essentially you need to start a YModem receive
using the <code>yrecv</code> built in command in CPICOM, then tell the
terminal emulator to start a YModem upload. Ideally, set the 
YModem block size to 1kB if that isn't the default -- that seems
to be the most reliable setting. It's not hugely fast to upload
software this way, but CP/M programs are rarely large. Be aware
that many CP/M programs are distributed as multiple files, all of
which will need to be uploaded to the same (emulated) disk drive.
</p>

<p>
CPICOM will run a number of CP/M stalwarts, like WordStar and
Zork (see screenshot below). In fact, I would expect 
most "well-behaved" CP/M programs
to work, so long as they were written for generic CP/M 2.2, and not
for a specific microcomputer. 
</p>

</p>

<h2>Things to bear in mind</h2>

<p>
CP/M was primitive, and designed to run on the primitive hardware
of the day. CP/M programs often behave in ways which would be damaging to
modern hardware -- endless input-checking loops at full CPU speed, for example.
To be honest, I do not know if this kind of thing would be damaging
to a Pico, but I don't want to risk it. CPICOM has a number of pause points
built in, to give the microcontroller time to idle. These do slow the 
system down even further, and I'm not sure whether they're necessary.
They're certainly necessary when running the same code on a Linux
workstation -- I'm certain of that much at least, just from listening
to the roar of the cooling fans.
</p>

<p>
CPICOM emulates a generic CP/M 2.2 machine. It doesn't have any of
the features of a specific computer -- most obviously, it has no
graphics or sound capabilities. 
</p>

<p>
Everything about CP/M is in a kind of legal limbo. Although it's easy
to obtain CP/M software in binary form, it's mostly not in the public
domain, and it's very rarely open source. CP/M predates the open source
movement by thirty years. I'd like to include CP/M software, or links
to software, that I know to work with CPICOM, but I'm not sure of the
legal implications. A web search for "CP/M software archive" will
provide some good leads.  
</p>

<p>
Much CP/M software was entirely line-based, like Zork -- type a line
of input, get some lines of output.  Such software will
probably work with any terminal or terminal emulator. Screen-based
software, like word processors and programming editors, immediately
raise problems of terminal compatibility. CPICOM makes one small
contribution to solving this problem -- it converts VT52 terminal
control codes to VT100. This is to make WordStar, and programs that
were influenced by it, work properly with the Mincom terminal.
In all other respects, CPICOM can't do anything to help with the fact
that the CP/M software might be written for a terminal that your
emulator doesn't support. Some CP/M software allows the user
to chose a terminal type -- when using Minicom, VT52 is probably the best
choice, given the built-in conversion provided by CPICOM.   
</p>

<h2>Further work</h2>

These are the various ways in which I might extend this project,
if time permits. Of course, collaborators are always welcome.

<ul>

<li><p>
It would be interesting to fit the Pico with a real display
device, and thus make it a better replica of a 1980s desktop
computer. With a captive display, CPICOM could start to replicate
a real, proprietary computer of the era, 
perhaps one with a graphics controller. The Pico 
can drive a VGA monitor at low-ish resolution, but it's not clear
whether it can do this an still have CPU power left over for
anything else. Still, if the ZX80 could generate a video signal
from its CPU while still running BASIC programs back in 1980,
the Pico should be able to do it. It would be interesting to try
to use the second CPU core for video generation but, as things 
currently stand, there's no robust way to do this whilst 
writing to the flash storage, and that's where the file storage
is. 
</p></li>

<li><p>
Add support for external storage devices. The obvious choice here
is an SD card, probably with a VFAT filesystem. However, it might
be interesting to fit a real floppy drive (if any working examples
can still be found outside museums). The need to push software 
onto the board using YModem 
is a bit of a nuisance.
</p></li>

<li><p>
If CPICOM can drive a display, the logical next step is to
provide it with a keyboard. It wouldn't be hard to interface a
PS/2 keyboard or similar, but it would be more
fun to repurpose a real keyboard and case from a defunct VIC20
or something like it. 
</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
I was fortunate enough to work with CP/M back in the late 70s, when it
was a big deal. It's been interesting to rediscover the joys of 
BDOS and BIOS, and the Z80 instruction set. Back in the 70s it did
not surprise me know much could be achieved in a program that fit
into 30kB of memory -- I just took it for granted. These days
I'm surprised at how little we often accomplish, in software installations 
a million times larger than this.
