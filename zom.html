<h1>Night of the living differential equations -- modeling the zombie apocalyse</h1>

<img class="article-top-image" src="img/zom.png"/>

We all know it's coming, sooner or later. So far, outbreaks of zombiism have
been confined to remote, isolated communities, and have been contained. 
Eventually, 
however, the contagion will break out in an large, urban area and, before
we know it, the world will be filled with shuffling, decomposing monsters,
intent on only one thing -- devouring the flesh of the small group of
terrified survivors.
<p/>
Tragically, it is most likely that the bulk of the human 
population will become zombies very
rapidly, before anybody realizes the danger. Studies have shown
that even a superficial bite or scratch from a zombie is sufficient to
pass on the contagion. Zombies are not fast, or particularly cunning,
but they are relentless. 
<p/>
Because of the nature of the spread of contagion, probably the only
significant pockets of survivors are likely to be comprised of people
who were in some form of isolation at the start of the outbreak, and
have managed to band together with similar survivors. 
If such a group 
does manage to get through the first few days of the outbreak, and is fully
aware of the dangers, then it has at least some chance of surviving
in the longer term. It might even be able to eliminate enough zombies
from its own locality to form a real community.
<p/>
In this article, I describe an algebraic model of human-zombie population
dynamics, and its implementation as a computer simulation. Using the
simulation, certain important factors can be inferred about the factors
that contribute to the long-term survival of a small survivor community, or
otherwise.
 
<h2>About zombies</h2>

In order to model zombie-human population dynamics, we need to understand
the characteristics of zombies, and their interaction with humans.

<ul>
<li>Zombiism is a disease that is transmitted from one individual to
another by physical contact, usually biting. The more interaction there 
is between the 
zombie and human populations, the more potential there is for contagion.</li>
<li>
Zombies are drawn to eat the flesh of healthy humans. However, they
do not need this for nutritive purposes -- zombies seem to be able to
survive indefinitely without nutrition. If there are no humans left, the
zombie population will not decline, but remain constant. It is not known
whether zombies eventually decay to the point of dysfunction, or will 
start to feed on one another.
</li>
<li>
So far as we know, zombies do not feed on vegetables. They certainly
can't open tin cans. Consequently, 
zombies do not put significant pressure on the food reserves of human
survivors.
</li>
<li>
The only certain way to put down a zombie is
total destruction of the brain-stem, or decapitation. 
This process is colloquially known as 'debraining'.
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Building the model</h2>

In many ways the interaction between humans and zombies is like a
classical predator-prey population dynamic, of the type frequently modeled
using the Lotka-Volterra equations. One important difference is that
both populations are, in a sense, predators on one another. Moreover,
when zombies successfully prey on humans, there is a strong chance that
the unfortunate victim will end up joining the zombie population. As a result,
the populations of humans and zombies do not follow
the cyclic rise and fall associated with the Lotka-Volterra model;
in general, one population survives and the other is wiped out,
as we shall see.
<P/>
Let's start with the following parameters:

<table align="center" vspace="10" border="1" 
    bgcolor="#FFFFD0" cellspacing="10px" width="40%">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    H<sub>0</sub>
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    Size of the human survivor population at time t<sub>0</sub>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    Z<sub>0</sub>
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    Size of the zombie population at time t<sub>0</sub>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Our task will be to write equations that give new Values of H and Z -- H<sub>1</sub> and
Z<sub>1</sub> -- that reflect the changes to the populations after a 
unit of time. We can then study these equations mathematically, and
simulate them using a computer program.
<p/>
In traditional predator-prey modelling, it is conventional to assume that
predation will follow a form of mass-action law. That is, it is assumed
that the number of predations will be proportional both to the size of
the predator population, and the size of the prey population. 
Using that principle with our zombie model, we can estimate the number 
of zombie attacks at time t<sub>0</sub> to be

<blockquote>
&beta; H<sub>0</sub>Z<sub>0</sub>
</blockquote>

Where &beta; is a number that represents the average number of successful
zombie attacks per zombie per human per unit time.

<table align="center" vspace="10" border="1" bgcolor="#FFFFD0" cellspacing="10px" width="40%">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    &beta; 
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    Zombie vigour parameter -- attacks per zombie, per human, per unit time
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>



Not all zombie attacks will result in a new zombie -- it's reasonably
to assume that a proportion, perhaps a high proportion, will 
lead to the unfortunate human victim being completely consumed.
I will use the parameter &gamma; to represent this proportion.

<table align="center" vspace="10" border="1" bgcolor="#FFFFD0" cellspacing="10px" width="40%">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    &gamma; 
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    Zombie fatality parameter -- proportion of zombie attacks that result in 
    a human fatality, rather than a new zombie. 
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


The number of new zombies is therefore given by

<blockquote>
&gamma;&beta; H<sub>0</sub>Z<sub>0</sub>
</blockquote>


The zombie population will increase by this amount between 
t<sub>0</sub> and t<sub>1</sub>, while the human population will
decrease by

<blockquote>
&beta; H<sub>0</sub>Z<sub>0</sub>
</blockquote>

The human population is decreased by the same amount whether the human ends
up dead or a zombie, so &gamma; does not feature in this term.
 
<p/>
It's reasonable to think that the human population won't submit meekly to
the living dead, and will fight back in some way. In this case, however,
I suspect that the mass-action principle will not be appropriate.
If the population of zombies tends to be much larger than the population
or survivors -- as we are assuming here -- then the number
of debrainings will not be influenced all that much by the size of the 
zombie population -- it is effectively unlimited. Rather, it will depend
on the size of the human survivor population, and how willing and able 
people are to take up arms (or axes, or baseball bats, as the case may be.) 
<p/>
Consequently, I'm going to assume that the number of zombies debrained
between time t<sub>0</sub> and t<sub>1</sub> is simply given by

<blockquote>
&alpha; H<sub>0</sub>
</blockquote>

<table align="center" vspace="10" border="1" bgcolor="#FFFFD0" cellspacing="10px" width="40%">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    &alpha; 
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    Debraining parameter -- average 
    number of zombies debrained per human survivor per unit time
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

It should be recognized immediately that, if no humans join the survivor
group, then the best the human population can hope for is to remain
constant. Frankly, this is unlikely, since it is surrounded by a crowd
of slavering flesh-eaters. So we're going to have to rely on some
influx of survivors, perhaps from other communities. In traditional
predator-prey models there is a notion of birth rate; in the zombie
scenario,
I suspect that timescales will be too short for the human community to
be bolstered by births. In any event, the circumstances of the zombie
apocalypse will almost certainly deter all but the most ardent survivors
from thoughts of reproduction. Consequently, we will assume that the
influx of new humans into the group is a constant, which I will
refer to as &pi;. I will continue to use 'birth rate' for this
parameter, lacking a better term.

<table align="center" vspace="10" border="1" bgcolor="#FFFFD0" cellspacing="10px" width="40%">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    &pi; 
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    'birth rate' -- number of people joining the survivor community, 
    per unit time
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

It also has to be assumed that, in post-apocalyptic conditions, many 
human survivors will fall victim to non zombie-related casualties -- disease,
hunger, fighting within the group, and so on. We will assume that
the number of fatalities depends only on the size of the human
group at a particular time, and is therefore given by:

<blockquote> 
&delta;H<sub>0</sub>
</blockquote> 

where &delta;, the <i>death rate</i> is a number expressed in deaths
per person per unit time. It is to be hoped that &delta; is a number
very much less than 1.0.

<table align="center" vspace="10" border="1" bgcolor="#FFFFD0" cellspacing="10px" width="40%">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    &delta; 
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    death rate -- non zombie-related deaths in the community, per person, 
    per unit time
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

For the purposes of this simulation, I'm assuming that lack of food
will not be a problem for the human survivors, at least in the short
term. With a massively-reduced human population, there will be ample
food in reserve, so this potentially population-limiting factor does
not have to be incorporated into the model.
<p/>
Putting all these factors together, we arrive at the following
expressions for values of H<sub>1</sub> and Z<sub>1</sub> at 
time t<sub>1</sub>:

<blockquote align=center style="background:#FFFFD0; border:solid 1px; padding:5px; "> 
<b>[eq.1]</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; H<sub>1</sub> = H<sub>0</sub> + &pi; - &delta;H<sub>0</sub> - &beta;H<sub>0</sub>Z<sub>0</sub>
<p/> 
<b>[eq.2]</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Z<sub>1</sub> = Z<sub>0</sub> + (1-&gamma;)&beta;H<sub>0</sub>Z<sub>0</sub> - &alpha;H<sub>0</sub>
</blockquote>

At this point, we could transform these expressions into a pair of autonomous
differential equations. The equations are non-linear, however, because they
contain product terms H<sub>0</sub>Z<sub>0</sub>. Consequently, they
have no analytic solution for H and Z in terms of time, but we  
can implement eq.1 and eq.2
in a computer program, and let it loop around for as long as required,
feeding the generated values of H and Z back into the model at each iteration.
<p/>

<h2>Implementing the mathematical model in a computer program</h2>

I've implemented the population model of eq.1 and eq.2 in a C program, 
which can be downloaded <a href="code/zom.c">here</a>. The program takes
the parameters H<sub<0</sub>, &alpha;, etc, as command-line
arguments, and outputs three
columns -- the time, the value of H, and the value of Z. The output
is suitable to be fed into <code>gnuplot</code> to be plotted. 
Although the program is 
several hundred lines long, most of this is for checking errors and
processing the command-line arguments. If you look at the code, you'll
see all of the real work is done in the function <code>run_model()</code>,
which is only a few lines long. This program is, in fact, an implementation
of Euler's method for solving differential equations numerically. 
Euler's method has the advantage of speed and simplicity, and it's 
accurate enough for our purposes, given that the values of all the
input parameters are entirely speculative. 
<p/>

A sample run of the program might look like this:

<pre class="codeblock">
zom -t 100 -H 50 -Z 1000 -a 0.5 -b 0.00001 -p 5 -d 0.02 -r 0 -g 0.5 &gt; zom.dat
</pre>

The argument <code>-t</code> indicates the number of time intervals for to 
iterate. <code>-H</code> and <code>-Z</code> are the initial numbers of 
humans and zombies respectively. <code>-a</code>, <code>-b</code>, 
<code>-g</code>, <code>-d</code>, and <code>-p</code> are the values
of &alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;, &delta;, and &pi; in the model
description above. The argument <code>-r</code> indicates when the
human population should start to retaliate against the zombies, and
can be used to simulate the effect of delayed retaliation (see 
discussion below).


<h2>Sample simulations</h2>

For simplicity, I'm going to assume that the events of the immediate
post-apocalyptic period play out in at most a few years, and I will refer
to the unit of time as a week. Of course, it doesn't make any difference
what time units we use, so long as the parameters &alpha;, &beta;, etc., are
adjusted accordingly. It's just easier to say 'per week' rather than
'per unit time'.
<p/>
Let's consider an initial population of 1,000 zombies and 50 survivors.
In each week, the rate of zombie attacks, given by &beta;, is 0.0001 per
zombie per human -- this equates to five more zombies, and five fewer
humans, in the first week (as &gamma; is zero, indicating that all
attack humans become zombies). However, the 'birth rate' &pi;, five
per week, is sufficient to offset those losses to the survivor population,
and the survivors are debraining 0.5 * 50 = 25 zombies in the first
week. The human (non-zombie) death rather is relative low, at 2% of
the population per week. The results of this simulation are shown in 
figure 1.

<p align="center">
<img src="img/zom_fig_1.png">
<br>
Fig 1: Humans win: &alpha;=0.5, &beta;=0.0001, &pi;=5; &delta;=0.02, &gamma;=0
<p/>

This relatively vigorous retaliation on the part of the survivors,
coupled with a healthy influx of new survivors to the group, 
destroys the zombie population in
about 40 weeks. The human population begins to rise after that, as
we might expect; but it flattens off after a couple of years or so
as the death rate starts to match the influx rate. Of course, in
two years we might see the population increased by real births,
which would be at a level dependent on the population, not a constant;
population increase would be much more rapid in that case.
<p/>
Figure 2 shows a completely different scenario. Here we have somewhat
more aggressive zombies, somewhat less retaliatory humans, and a
lower rate of influx to the survivor population. Result: more-or-less
complete destruction of the survivor group in about six weeks.

<p align="center">
<img src="img/zom_fig_2.png">
<br>
Fig 2: Zombies win: &alpha;=0.1, &beta;= 0.0003, &pi;=1; &delta;=0.02, &gamma;=0
<p/>

<h2>Fight or flight?</h2>

The prospect for the human survivor population can clearly be improved
by both retaliating more vigorously, or doing more to avoid zombie
attacks. The question is bound to arise: which is more effective?

Figure 3 shows the effect of varying the debraining parameter, &alpha;,
with the other parameters remaining constant -- 
&beta;= 0.0001, &pi;=5, &delta; = 0.02.


<p align="center">
<img src="img/zom_fig_3.png">
<br>
Fig 3: Variation of zombie cleanup time for different values of &alpha; 
<p/>

Figure 4 shows the variation of cleanup rate for different values of
&beta;, with other parameters constant: &alpha;=0.5, 
&pi;=5; &delta;=0.02, &gamma;=0.


<p align="center">
<img src="img/zom_fig_4.png">
<br>
Fig 4: Variation of zombie cleanup time for different values of &beta; 
<p/>

Figures 3 and 4 show that, in the stated conditions, with humans basically
on top of the zombie problem, increasing retaliation and reducing
zombie attacks have broadly the same efficacy. Very roughly, a 
doubling of &alpha; or a halving of &beta; will lead to a halving of
the cleanup time.
<p/>
So much for a situation where the humans are basically on top of the
situation. What about where they are getting routed?
Consider a situation where the model has the following parameters
(again starting with 50 human surivors and 1000 zombies):
&alpha;=1.0, &beta;=0.001, &pi;=1, &delta;=0.02, &gamma;=0.
How much must the debraining factor &alpha; be increased to change this
dire situation into one where the humans dispose of their undead problem
in under a year? It turns out that &alpha; must be increased by a factor
of 6.6 to bring about this result. What about reducing the frequency
of zombie attacks? This requires that &beta; be reduced from 0.001 to
0.00011 -- a nine-fold reduction.
 
</p>

The exact effects of increasing retaliation compared to reducing 
zombification depend on the exact simulation parameters, but large
numbers of simulations have shown that, in general, better results
are obtained by increasing &alpha; than by reducing &beta; by the same amount.
This, in fact, is a common-sense result -- if the survivors increase their
rate of destruction of zombies, this not only reduces the zombie population 
itself, it also reduces the amount of predation that the zombie population
can inflict on the survivors.

<p/>

In practice, of course, the human population might not have equal opportunities
to increase &alpha; as to reduce &beta;. Retaliation against the zombies
requires weapons, which might not be readily available, and the
strength to use them. 



<h3>Equilibrium analysis</h3>

So much for graphs. More analytically, 
it is useful to consider the situations in which the populations H and
Z are constant, that is, in equilibrium. This is because by doing so
we can determine values of the model parameters that represent the
turning points between a human victory and a zombie victory.
<p/>
At equilibrium, H<sub>1</sub> = H<sub>0</sub> and Z<sub>1</sub> = Z<sub>0</sub>, and therefore, from eq.1 and eq.2 we get: 

<blockquote style="background:#FFFFD0; border:solid 1px; padding:5px">
<b>[eq.3</b>]&nbsp;&nbsp;  &pi; - &delta;H<sub>0</sub> = &beta;H<sub>0</sub>Z<sub>0</sub> 
<p/> 
(1-&gamma;)&beta;H<sub>0</sub>Z<sub>0</sub> = &alpha;H<sub>0</sub> 
<br/>
=&gt; <b>[eq.4]</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  (1-&gamma;)&beta;Z<sub>0</sub> = &alpha;
</blockquote>

However, because these equations are autonomous, we can consider the 
stability of each population separately, as well as together.
<p/>
Considering first the stability of the human population, so long as 
there is any
predation at all by zombies (that is, &beta;H<sub>0</sub>Z<sub>0</sub> &gt; 0),
then at equilibrium 

<blockquote>
&pi; - &delta;H<sub>0</sub> &gt; 0; 
</blockquote>
 
This is just another way of expressing the fact that the birth rate must at least equal the death rate for stability. In practice, of course, the birth rate
must considerably exceed the death rate, because the number of zombie attacks,
&beta;H<sub>0</sub>Z<sub>0</sub>, will be considerably greater than zero. 
<p/>
Eq.3 can be rearranged to give;

<blockquote>
&pi; = H<sub>0</sub> (&beta;Z<sub>0</sub> + &delta;)
</blockquote>

If the zombie vigour parameter &beta; is small, then this reduces to

<blockquote>
&pi; = &delta;H<sub>0</sub>
</blockquote>

Which, again, just tells us that the birth rate must equal the death rate --
an unsurprising result. However, if the zombie vigour parameter is large, so
that zombifications are considerably larger than natural deaths, then

<blockquote>
&pi; &#8773; &beta;H<sub>0</sub>Z<sub>0</code>
</blockquote>

If the number of zombies Z is large compared to the human survivor population 
H, such that we can assume that Z is reasonably constant in the short term, 
then this means that:

<blockquote>
<i>For stability of a human survivor population, the birth rate must
increase in proportion to the present size of that population.</i>
</blockquote>

This is a rather odd, and disturbing result. It suggests that the survivor
population must absorb newcomers (or experience births) more 
rapidly as it grows.
This might happen -- other survivor communities might be drawn to merge
with a community that appears to be successful (that is, growing). If
it doesn't, then the increased population just means an increased
rate of predation by zombies, because the pool of susceptible humans is
larger.

Of course, this analysis assumes that the zombie population is large and 
approximately constant, compared to the human population. An increased size
of the human population might be thought to lead to a reduction in the 
zombie population,
if the debraining factor &alpha; is high enough. But is that really the case?
For the zombie population at equilibrium we have

<blockquote>
(1-&gamma;)&beta;Z<sub>0</sub> = &alpha;
</blockquote>

Note that there is no H term in this
relationship. What this tells us is that 

<blockquote>
<i>If the zombie population is stable, then that stability will not be
disturbed by adding more humans to the survivor group.</i>
</blockquote>

Again, a somewhat disturbing result. The explanation is that, although
increasing the number of humans will result in an increased number 
of debrainings, it will result in an increase in zombifications by
<i>exactly the same amount</i>. That's because both factors are
proportional to H.

<p/>
Can the zombie and human populations be in equilibrium at the same time?
Actually, there are any number of ways in which this can happen in principle 
-- any values of the parameters that satisfy both equations 3 and 4 will
lead to this result. Given any five values of the
model parameters we can find the sixth. Provided that the parameters are
all physically valid (death rate is not negative, for example), then
we have a potential equilibrium solution. For example, the following parameters
lead to stable values of both the human and zombie populations:

<table align="center" vspace="10" border="1" bgcolor="#FFFFD0" cellspacing="10px">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    H<sub>0</sub>
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    50 humans initially
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    Z<sub>0</sub>
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    1000 zombies initially
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    &pi; 
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    1 human joins the group per week 
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    &delta; 
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    0.01 non-zombie-related human deaths per human, per week 
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    &alpha; 
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    0.01 debrainings per human, per week 
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    &beta; 
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    0.0001 zombie attacks, per human, per zombie, per week 
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    &gamma; 
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    0 human fatalities per zombie attack (100% zombification) 
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Although it is tricky to show analytically, experimentally it turns out
that these equiliria are mostly unstable. That is, slight departures of H or Z
from the equilibrium values do not return the system to its equilibrium;
instead, the difference from equilibrium increases, in one or both
populations.
<p/>
This means that <i>in practice equilibrium states are unlikely to be reached</i>
 (for the same reason that, even though you can balance a pencil on its end,
 if you drop a box of pencils, few of them will end up standing on end.)
<p/>
There is potentially <i>one</i> stable eqilibrium, of course: the one in which
both populations reach zero, or a number so close to zero that it
makes no practical difference. This can only occur when there is no
inward migration to the human population (that is, &Pi;=0).

<h2>Delayed recovery of the survivor population</h2>

One surprising result that simulation shows is that the human population
can, in principle, recover from very heavy losses, provided that there is
at least some replenishment of the population. Figure 5 shows
such a scenario.

<p align="center">
<img src="img/zom_fig_5.png">
<br>
Fig 5: Humans win (eventually): &alpha;=0.4, &beta;= 0.0001, &pi;=1, &delta;=0.02, &gamma;=0
<p/>

By week 30, the population of humans has dropped from 50 to 10. Yet the zombie
population continues to decline, and is eventually eliminated.
The human population rises, as might be expected, when there are no more
zombies; but in fact it has started to rise well before that point.
How is that possible?
<p/>
According to the model, a small human population can be as effective against
zombies as a large one. The reason is that, although a large population
provides more capacity to fight zombies, it also provides a greater
pool of prey for the zombies. A small population can continue to
pick off zombies, while providing a much smaller reservoir of potential
victims. As figure 6 shows, in this simulation the turning point for
the humans comes at about week 70. This is the point at which the
remaining zombies are unable to inflict sufficient losses on the humans
to counteract the inward migration to the community.
<p/>
The problem with the model is that, in this respect, it is too simplistic.
The arithmetic works perfectly well with very small population sizes,
but real organisms don't. A population of ten might not be self-sustaining;
it certainly won't attract the inward migration needed to compensate
for zombie-induced losses. What's more, a radical fall in population
is such a short time is likely to be destructive of morale, leading
to a loss of motivation and break-up of the group. This problem is well
known in  predator-prey modeling, and is sometimes known as the 
<i>atto-fox</i> effect. An atto-fox is, presumably, one 
ten-to-the-eighteenth-power of a fox; a number of foxes that is physically 
unrealizable, but that can still have a mathematical significance.
<p/>
In short, care needs to be taken when interpreting simulation results
that show recovery from very small populations. 

<h2>Effect of delayed response</h2>

We are all, I hope, prepared for Z-day. We've been sufficiently well-educated
by the recent deluge of zombie movies to know exactly how to respond --
pick up the nearest blunt instrument and go for those brains. Intuitively,
an early retaliation seems more likely to be effective than a late one,
and simulation backs that up.
<p/>
Consider the scenario shown in figure 5 above; compare
that to the outcome if the human retaliation is delayed by 20 weeks (figure 6).

<p align="center">

<br>
Fig 6: Delayed response: &alpha;=0.4, &beta;= 0.0001, &pi;=1, &delta;=0.02, &gamma;=0, with retaliation deferred until week 20
<p/>

Because there is predation, but no retaliation, for the first
20 weeks, the human population falls rapidly, accompanied by a rapid
rise in the zombie population. Although, in this simulation, the
human population does eventually recover (for reasons discussed in the
previous section), it drops 
perilously quickly to a perilously low level.
Very likely a real community could not survive such a drop. Even 
if it could, the time taken to dispose of the undead menace is extended from
about three years to about five years -- that's two more years of
living with zombies on the doorstep, for 
a delay of only about four months.
<p/>
This result confirms the necessity for a rapid response to the zombie threat,
if such confirmation were necessary.

<h2>Fatal and non-fatal zombie attacks</h2>

Not all zombie attacks will necessarily result in a passing of the contagion.
In some cases, the victim might be completely consumed. We've been assuming
so far that all attacks do result in zomification of the victim,
because this is the worst case. This is likely to be a realistic scenario
where the population is relatively dispersed: zombies are slow and
not very smart, and humans that are attacked usually escape, but only
after being passed the infectious agent.
<p/>
In the early stages of conflict, when we are assuming that zombies
outnumber humans considerably, the population levels are only slightly
affected by whether human victims become zombies or not. After all, 
the human population loses a member either way, and the increase in
the zombie population is likely to be proportionately insignificant. 
It is when the 
zombie numbers start to fall that the outcome of a zombie
attack makes a difference.
<p/>
In this model I have used the symbol &gamma;, the <i>zombie fatality proportion</i> to represent the number of attacks that result in a new zombie.
When &gamma;=0, there are no human fatalities, and all attacks
result in a new zombie. When &gamma;=1, all humans are consumed, and no
new zombies are created.
<p/>
The effect of &gamma; is most noticeable in situations where the
human and zombie populations are vigorous and closely matched.
Figure 7 shows the effect of varying &gamma; between the all-fatality and
all-zombie situations on the time taken to clean up the zombies.
It's always been understood that survivors of zombie attacks who have
been bitten pose a greater threat to the survivor community than
those who are killed outright; figure 7 shows just how significant
this factor is.

<p align="center">
<img src="img/zom_fig_7.png">
<br>
Fig 7: Effect of varying the proportion of zombie attacks that result in human fatality: &alpha;=0.5, &beta;= 0.0005, &pi;=5, &delta;=0.02
<p/>

These results suggest that humans who survive zombie attacks, but
are likely to be infected, should always be killed for the greater good of the
community. The problem with this simplistic analysis is that it assumes 
unlimited resources on the part of the survivor population. In practice, 
if an infected person does not willing submit to euthanasia, tracking him
down and eliminating him is likely to be far more difficult than
debraining an existing zombie. Moreover, doing so is likely to have
a detrimental effect on community morale. 
 

<h2>Further work</h2>

Certain factors have not been taken into account in this analysis, although
they could easily be added to the model.
<p/>
1. In practice, a survivor community is likely to be pressed for resources
(not food, perhaps, but everything else) and highly stressed. It is entirely possible that conflict between
survivors could be a more significant cause of losses than zombie attacks.
<p/>
2. There have been some successes with treating zombiism with drugs
(Zombrex and the like). These drugs, if administered regularly, do not
cure the condition, but they do make sufferers less aggressive and therefore
less prone to communicate the condition. In this article I have assumed that 
zombiism is incurable, because once a situation is reached where there
are a large number of zombies and a small community of survivors, 
most likely there will be insufficient survivors to attempt to treat
the zombies, even if supplies of drugs were available. 
<p/>
3. It is not known at present how long a zombie can remain active. Zombies
do not appear to need to feed -- they feed when they can, for reasons 
that are not well understood, but they can survive for long periods of
time with no sustenance at all. If zombies do eventually decay, then
that can be added to the model in an way analogous to the human death
rate.


<h2>Conclusions</h2>

So what does our computer simulation of zombie/human population dynamics
tell us about surviving the zombie apocalypse? There are certain
clear conclusions.

<ul>
<li>Increasing the rate of retaliation against zombies, and reducing the
amount of predation from zombies, are both effective ways to improve the
humans' chances. However, increasing retaliation seems to be at least
as effective as reducing predation by the same factor, and often much
more effective.
</li>
<li>
As the survivor population increases, either by births or migration,
the proportional increase must be matched by encouraging births or 
migration by the same proportion. This is because, unfortunately, 
zombie predation
is proportional to the human population size. If the rate of migration
or birth cannot be increased, then population stability can only be
ensured by increasing the <i>per human</i> retaliation rate. That is,
<i>each</i> human must debrain an increased number of zombies. Alternatively,
the predation rate must be reduced somehow.
</li>
<li>
If the zombie population is large and roughly stable, then increasing
the number of humans will, by itself, have little impact on the
number of zombies. Again, this is because predation and retaliation will
increase by the same factor, all other things being equal.
</li>
<li>
The human response to the zombie threat must be immediate. Small delays
in retaliation have disproportionate effects on the ability of
the community to dispose of zombies.
</li>
<li>
In situations where the humans and zombies are roughly evenly matched, allowing
survivors of zombie attacks to go on to become zombies themselves
has a significant detrimental effect on the balance of power.
However, tracking down and eliminating such survivors is likely to 
consume much more resources than eliminating existing zombies.
</li>
<li>
Although possible in principle, it is unlikely that the human and zombie
populations will reach equilibrium -- one
population will survive at the expense of the other.
</li>
