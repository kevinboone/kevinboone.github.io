<h1>Why your vintage turntable could kill you</h1>

<p>
<img src="img/plug.png" alt="plug symbol" class="article-top-image"/>
Accompanying the recent "<a href="vinylrevival.html">vinyl revival</a>"
-- the resurgence of interest in vinyl records -- is a fascination with 
vintage equipment to play these records on. There are
plenty of contemporary turntables,
but there's a certain authenticity that comes from playing your
records on a fifty year-old machine.
</p>
<p>
There's a brisk trade in 70s and 80s turntables on eBay and similar
sites and, in fact, some of these old machines perform at least
as well as the best modern turntables (usually after a careful
service). Unfortunately, most vintage turntables and, I'm sorry to
say, some modern ones do not comply with contemporary electrical
safety standards. Although the risk of electrocution is small, it's
not zero. 
</p>
<p>
Doubly unfortunate is the fact that a lot of dangerous nonsense is
written about this subject on websites. It's crucial to understand
the distinct roles of safety earthing and signal earthing and, it seems,
many people do not.
</p>

<h2>Why is there a problem?</h2>

<p>
Many vintage turntables (and some modern ones) are connected to the
electrical mains as shown in the diagram below. They have only a 
two-wire electrical supply, along with an
earth post or a trailing earth wire. If there is an earth wire,
it's usually terminated in some kind of spade connection, for 
attachment to some other piece of equipment.
</p>

 <figcaption>
 <i>
 Most vintage turntables use only a two-core mains connection, with no
 safety earth. There is often an earth post, but what to connect it to?
 The red line indicates a potential fault from the mains live to the
 chassis. Ouch.
 </i>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The problem with this arrangement is that there may be no path for
fault currents if a live electrical connection makes contact with
a metal part of the turntable (as suggested by the red
line in the diagram above). No fuse or breaker will trip, and the 
live parts will be a hazard to anybody who touches them.
</p>
<p>
To be fair, earth-leakage protection in modern electrical installations
will disconnect the supply fairly quickly if somebody does actually
touch the part of the turntable that has inadvertently become live.
Still, it's not considered good practice to rely on this -- a live-to-earth
fault ought to result in an immediate (well, milliseconds) disconnection.
Earth-leakage protection <i>should</i> prevent a fatal electrocution, but
you could still get a nasty jolt. 
</p>
<p>
Given this hazard, it's worth asking why this was such a popular way 
of wiring turntables. The answer lies in that old bugbear, the
<i>earth loop</i>. Phono cartridges produce a very tiny signal, which
needs a lot of amplification. The amplification will magnify the
tiny electrical currents that flow between devices when their <i>signal</i>
(not safety) earths are at different potentials. In most consumer-grade
amplifiers, the roles of safety earth and signal earth are mixed: amplifiers
have metal cabinets both to provide a path for fault currents (safety), and
to absorb electrical interference (signal). 
</p>

<h2>The conventional solution</h2>

<p>
Given this dual role of the earth, the conventional way to wire up
a vintage turntable is as shown below.
</p>


<figure style="margin: 1em; text-align: center">
 <img src="img/tt-safety-2.png" width="550px" alt="turntable wiring" />
 <figcaption>
 <i>
 Conventionally, the turntable chassis is earthed by a direct connection
 to an amplifier's earth post. Unfortunately, the wiring
 is often not designed to carry a fault current safely.
 </i>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
This arrangement (mostly) avoids earth loops because the turntable
does not have its own earth (either safety or signal). The 
turntable is earthed by either, or both, of the wire between the 
earth posts, and the screens of the audio connectors. 
</p>
<p>
In the event of a live-to-earth fault in the turntable, the path for
fault current is through the turntable chassis to the amplifier
chassis, and thus to the mains earth. All being well, this fault current
will be sufficient to blow a fuse or trip a breaker.
</p>

<h2>Why the conventional solution is inadequate</h2>

<p>
The conventional earthing strategy does not conform to modern
safety standards, for two reasons.
</p>
<p>
First, the wire between the earth posts will almost certainly not
be matched to the tripping characteristics of the mains circuit 
breaker or plug fuse. Remember that, in the event of a live-to-earth fault, 
this earthing wire
will carry the entire fault current, until the breaker trips. As a
minimum, it's got to have a higher current rating that the breaker or
fuse. Suppose the turntable is fitted with a 5-amp plug fuse. In the
event of a fault, which will fail first -- the plug fuse or the 
earth wire? If it's the latter, it could start a
fire. Many vintage turntables have a captive, trailing earth wire, which is
<i>probably</i> capable of standing 5 amps until the fuse blows.
But would you bet your house on it? At least if you're providing
your own earth wire, you can fit a heavy one with a substantial
current rating.
</p>
<p>
The second risk factor is more prosaic -- the earth wire can 
become disconnected. The safety earth wire in a three-pin plug
is not only rated to handle the expected fault current, it's 
impossible to disconnect it without tools. If you're providing
your own earth connection between pieces of audio equipment, you've got
to remember to reconnect it when, for example, you move the
equipment around. Since this earth connection is probably behind a 
stack of equipment, you won't see if, for example, it just works
loose with vibration.
</p>

<h2>A digression: self-contained pre-amps</h2>

<p>
Modern amplifiers often do not have phono-level inputs for
turntables. Contemporary turntables often have line-level
outputs suitable for modern amplifiers, but vintage models
rarely did. In this situation, you'll need some kind of
self-contained pre-amp, to convert the phono signal to line
level.
</p>
<p>
This potentially creates an additional hazard because, with such an arrangement,
it's not very clear what to connect the turntable's earth post to.
The pre-amp may have an earth post but, if it does, is it suitable for
use as a safety earth? If your pre-amp is powered by a 
wall-wart (or a battery), any earth post it provides will not be
suitable for a safety earth. There is almost certainly not
an earth connection between the pre-amp and the wall-wart and, even 
if there is, it probably won't be heavy enough to carry a fault
current. A mains-powered pre-amp <i>might</i> have an earth post
that is suitable for a safety earth, but it's best not to rely
on this, unless the manufacturer clearly states that it is suitable.
</p>
<p>
In general, you'll need to (safety) earth your turntable to something
that you are certain is a proper safety earth point. There's really only
is one way to be 100% sure of this -- more on this in a while.
</p>

<h2>What about double-insulated turntables?</h2>

<p>
Many contemporary turntables, and some vintage ones, were designed
to be <i>double-insulated</i>. This means that the live parts
are completely enclosed in some highly insulated enclosure withing
the appliance. Even in the event that a live connection goes astray,
there's no possibility of it contacting a metal part that a user
may touch.
</p>
<p>
Modern safety standards for double-insulated appliances require
careful testing, to ensure that the insulating housing really does
provide the level of insulation required to ensure safety.
Double-insulation was rare in vintage turntables. If it is used,
and if it is expected to conform to modern standards, there will 
probably be a prominent marking on the cabinet (in the UK, it's
a symbol consisting of one square inside another).
</p>
<p>
In a vintage device, however, that claims to be double-insulated, 
how far will you trust the insulating properties after forty or
fifty years? I'm not sure it's something I'd want to rely on.
</p>

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>
Despite what is often stated on web forums, there is only <i>one</i>
solution to this problem that complies with modern electrical
safety standards: <i>throw away the two-core cable, and replace it
with a three-core cable, with the earth soundly bonded to all exposed
metal parts</i>. The metal parts that need to be bonded <i>might</i>
all be connected to the existing earth post or flying earth wire,
but it's not safe to assume that. You'll need to use a meter to ensure
that there is a low resistance between any metal part a user can 
touch, and your new earth connection.
</p>
<p>
Will this create an earth loop? Perhaps. If it does, you may be
able to break the loop by disconnecting the screens of one or
both audio leads, at one end or the other. This is a fiddly process,
requiring a certain amount of trial-and-error. With your turntable
earthed properly, you may no longer need the secondary earth connection
between turntable and amplifier. If all else fails, you might need
a pre-amplifier that has electrical isolation in the signal path. 
Many good-quality amplifiers have this already, and are more-or-less
immune to earth loops.
</p>
<p>
In the end, though, safety has to override other concerns. Even if
you're prepared to take the risk of electrocution or fire yourself, is it
a risk you want to impose on other people in your household?
If you earth your turntable properly (from a safety perspective) then
all you risk is poor audio quality. If you don't, the only music you'll
be hearing could be that of harps.
</p>

<h2>A better solution</h2>
<p>
I'm interested in retro electrical and computer equipment, and I have
(I hope) the skills and time needed to get this old machinery working
safely. But it's often not easy.
</p>
<p>
You can buy a vintage turntable advertised as "working" on eBay
for, perhaps, &pound;50. But is it worth it?
</p>
<p>
Quite apart from the safety concerns, unless the vintage appliance has
been professional restored and serviced, it's probably a money pit.
An old turntable will probably have internal linkages that are gummed
up with decades-old grease, that will have to be stripped and
replaced. Electrical contacts might be corroded -- if they're not
actually loose. Weight-bearing springs will probably have been under
compression for so long that they have lost their springiness. 
Drive belts will be rotten; styluses will be worn. It's easy to get 
replacement parts for popular vintage turntables, but they can be
expensive, and installing them is not always straightforward.
</p>
<p>
With enough time and money, you can make a vintage turntable as good
as new. But, let's face it, if you got it for fifty quid from eBay,
it probably wasn't a top-notch design even when it <i>was</i> new.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, for about &pound;200 you can buy a perfectly
decent moden turntable which is not only likely to be electrically safe,
but it will work out-of-the-box. For a little more -- perhaps
&pound;250 -- you can buy a modern turntable with built-in
pre-amp, removing a bunch of wiring problems. You can even
buy turntables that transmit wirelessly using Bluetooth, although
I'm not sure I'd want to go that far. In short, using a 
genuine, vintage turntable creates safety problems, but those aren't
the only problems you're likely to encounter. A modern turntable
will almost certainly be safer, and in better order, it will probably
sound better as well.
</p>
<p>
Of course, for the vintage vinyl enthusiast, there's no substitute
for a turntable of the same era, even considering all the problems it brings.
