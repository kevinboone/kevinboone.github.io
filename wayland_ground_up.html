<h1 id="wayland-from-the-ground-up">Wayland from the ground up</h1>
<p><img src="img/tux.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>If, like me, you’ve been ignoring Wayland in the hope that it will
just go away, you’re out of luck. Most Linux distributions now want to
use Wayland by default – even Raspberry Pi OS. The Fedora project has,
for better or worse, reached the point where good old X.org won’t even
be available by default in new installations.</p>
<p>I suspect that the move to Wayland will be invisible to most end
users – so long as it works – at least on desktop systems. If you’re a
Linux developer, though, or even a sophisticated end user, there’s no
longer any way to avoid getting to grips with Wayland.</p>
<p>In this article I explain, from the very basics, how Wayland works,
and what makes it different from X.org. I make no comment on whether I
think Wayland is a Good Thing, or a Bad Thing; but I do have views on
this, and I fear that my biases might become apparent. Perhaps they
already have.</p>
<h2 id="a-bit-of-history">A bit of history</h2>
<p>I divide the task of understanding Wayland into two parts:
understanding how it works, and understanding <em>why</em> it works as
it does. Wayland embodies some design decisions that, to my mind, are
incomprehensible without at least some understanding of its place in the
overall lineage of graphical computing.</p>
<p>The first revision of the X11 protocol, published in 1987, defined a
way for application programs to communicate with graphical terminals.
This was a time when, in the world of high-performance computing,
‘processing’ and ‘user interaction’ took place on entirely different
pieces of hardware, connected by network cables. The ‘processing’ part
was typically a minicomputer, running a multi-user, multi-tasking
operating system like Unix. The ‘user interaction’ part was a terminal
of some kind: initially text terminals, and then graphics terminals. A
graphics terminal that supported X11 was, and still is, usually called
an ‘X terminal’, but ‘X server’ is a more general term. In the X world,
the<br />
‘server’ is whatever provides the user interface; a ‘client’ is any
application that works with that server. Under X11, the whole
infrastructure – the X server and its supporting client applications –
became known as the ‘X Window System’, or just ‘X’.</p>
<p>PCs – relative newcomers to the computing world at that time – did
not work in the same way at all. A desktop PC usually had, and still
has, a graphics adapter that connects directly to a monitor, and its own
input devices. Applications communicate with these devices directly, or
via the operating system. Initially, X11 had relatively little relevance
to PCs.</p>
<p>The last major revision on X11, ‘X11R6’, was published in 1994. X11R6
is a fabulously complex set of specifications, covering all aspects of
interaction between a graphical terminal and its client applications. It
defines, of course, how an application creates and manages screen
windows. But it also specifies the handling of fonts and cursors, many
methods for drawing lines and shapes, how applications can communicate
with one another via their windows, and so on.</p>
<p>By the early 90s, Linux was well established, and there was
increasing interest in running graphical applications. Linux
<em>could</em> have gone the same way as Microsoft Windows: it could
have defined an application programming interface by which software
could interact with a locally-connected, windowed screen display. That
this did not happen is probably because there was a already a stack of
software for X, which could readily be ported to Linux – well, more
readily than re-writing it all in Windows style. The problem was that
Linux ran on PCs with locally-attached displays, not separate graphics
terminals as X assumed. The solution – which no doubt seemed a good one
at the time – was for Linux to adopt X11R6 and implement the X server (X
terminal) in software. This software X server would run on Linux
alongside the applications that used it.</p>
<p>Thus X applications on Linux worked exactly as they did on any Unix
system, but using the software X server rather than a graphics
terminal.<br />
This server, originally called XFree86, was a full implementation of the
relevant X11 protocols. It was perfectly capable of working with client
applications on Unix minicomputers, or applications running on different
machines, as well as it did with local applications. That is, the
XFree86 X server had the same ‘network transparency’ as proprietary X
terminals of the 90s. I’m stressing this point because it is
emphatically <em>not</em> a feature of Wayland. Wayland is fundamentally
a protocol for applications to interact with locally-connected
displays.</p>
<p>It’s fun to speculate what would have happened if Linux had adopted
the ‘Windows way’ of managing a graphics display back in the 90s. Every
graphical Unix application would have had to be rewritten but, to some
extent, we’re doing that now for Wayland – we’re just thirty years
late.<br />
Probably XFree86 would never have been developed, much less Wayland.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, XFree86 eventually became X.org, after a bunch of
political shake-ups that aren’t particularly relevant, and so it
remains. In its early days, X.org mostly worked with hardware drivers
that were written specifically for it. There were drivers for video
adapters, naturally, but also keyboards, pointing devices, touch
screens, and so on. We usually had to write arcane configuration files
to select which drivers to use, and how to set them up. Later, a measure
of auto-configuration entered X.org, so it could handle many common
set-ups automatically. Still, the arcane configuration continues to
exist, for uncommon installations.</p>
<p>In the years after about 2010 there were two important changes in the
Linux ecosystem, which became crucial factors underlying the incentive
to develop Wayland.</p>
<p>First, some of the functionality that was formerly part of the X
server started to be replicated in other parts of Linux. Drivers for
graphics hardware, for example, started to move to the kernel. Widely
available libraries like libinput took over the detection and
integration of input devices. These changes were easily accommodated in
X.org, by writing new drivers for these new hardware interfaces. But the
old drivers never went away – they’re still in the code base, and still
have to be maintained. It’s unlikely that any <em>new</em> graphical
interface would need to use the same private device drivers that X.org
has and, indeed, Wayland generally does not.</p>
<p>The second important change was the widespread adoption of graphical
application frameworks like GTK and Qt. These frameworks worked with
X.org, but they also worked with Microsoft Windows and other platforms.
To enable this portability, the frameworks took over a lot of the
rendering work that used to be done by X.org. For example, X11 defines
protocols for displaying text in particular fonts, but GTK applications
typically do their own font rendering using a library like Cairo. So a
huge chunk of X.org rapidly became somewhat redundant. In fact, many
applications began to treat X.org as a kind of ‘super framebuffer’,
using extensions to X11R6 that allowed this mode of operation.</p>
<p>The complexity of X.org stems from its complicated driver
infrastructure, its <em>ad hoc</em> extensions, and the colossal feature
set of X11R6 itself. Yet it still requires a heap of supporting
software, if it is to be at all useful – particularly a <em>window
manager</em>. The screenshot below shows a couple of X applications
running with X.org, <em>without</em> any window manager. You’ll notice
that there are no window decorations, so there’s no way for the user to
manipulate the size of position of windows. Nor is there any way for the
user to switch active windows except with a mouse click.</p>
<figure>

alt="What X.org looks like, without all the supporting infrastructure" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">What X.org looks like, without all the
supporting infrastructure</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The job of manipulating windows on the user’s behalf falls to the
window manager. The window manager creates new, larger windows that
correspond to the applications’ windows, and then re-parents the
applications’ windows to be child windows of these larger windows. It
then then fills in the decorations – caption, buttons, etc. It’s the job
of the window manager to detect when the user has done something that
results in a window’s changing size or position; the application does
not do this, nor does X.org. So, with the simple, ancient TWM window
manager, and the same applications as before, we get this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/wayland_01.png" class="regular-inline-image"
alt="What X.org looks like, with a simple (TWM) window manager. Note that the application windows have been given new, decorated parents by the window manager" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">What X.org looks like, with a simple
(TWM) window manager. Note that the application windows have been given
new, decorated parents by the window manager</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Modern X window managers support ‘compositing’, using a specific
extension to X11R6. The window manager tells X.org not to render an
application’s graphics directly to the screen, but to some off-screen
buffer. The window manager then manipulates the applications’ buffers in
some way, before passing the modified results back to X.org for display.
This compositing operation provides support, for example, for window
transparency and other eye-candy.</p>
<p>This discussion about window managers isn’t a digression – window
management is one of the main differences between X11 and Wayland, as
we’ll see. It also illustrates another, more subtle problem:
security.</p>
<p>The X11 protocols define security at the user level, not at the
application level. Any application can manipulate any windows owned by
the same user. It’s precisely this fact that makes a window manager
possible – the window manager is just a client of X.org, with specific
responsibilities to other clients. But X11 came to prominence at a time
when the Internet was a less hostile place; we need to be a bit more
careful about security these days. As you might expect, Wayland takes a
different line on inter-window communication.</p>
<p>By about 2012 we were in a situation where X.org was stupendously
complex and feature-rich, but many of its features were only used by
legacy applications. That’s even more the case today. There were (and
are) multiple ways to interact with the same hardware in X.org, each of
which has an implementation that needs to be maintained. And features
that are only used by legacy applications have to continue to work, so
long as those applications remain in use.</p>
<p>There was, therefore, an incentive for a complete overhaul of the
whole X Window System; but there was no practical way to do this so long
as X.org was at its heart – X.org was just too complex, too enormous,
and too poorly understood.</p>
<p>In fact, many Linux maintainers felt that the whole,
network-transparent architecture of X11 was unnecessary in the world of
desktop computing. After all, many modern applications had been treating
X like a glorified framebuffer for years. Microsoft Windows worked
perfectly well without network transparency. So, rather than overhauling
X.org, perhaps it would be better to start from scratch, with a new kind
of architecture?</p>
<h2 id="the-wayland-architecture">The Wayland architecture</h2>
<p>We’ve seen that X.org provides a server process that implements the
X11 protocol. In almost all cases, X.org has to be combined with a
Window manager to be useful. Modern window managers went beyond the
original intention of X11, and performed their own composting
operations, transforming the output of X applications.</p>
<p>Wayland combines most of the graphics server, window manager, and
compositing functionality into a single <em>Wayland compositor</em>. The
rest it delegates to ordinary clients. Starting a Wayland session
amounts, in the end, to starting a compositor.</p>
<p>Proponents of Wayland often claim that it leads to simpler software
than was possible with X. But if a Wayland compositor combines so much
functionality from the X window system into one process, how can it be
simpler than X.org?</p>
<p>It’s possible because Wayland protocols are simpler than X11
protocols, with a much smaller feature set. So the Wayland compositor
doesn’t have to do more than a fraction of what X.org <em>can</em> do. A
lot of legacy code, rarely used in modern application programming, is
eliminated. The Wayland compositor is simpler also because it doesn’t
have to implement all the legacy drivers that X.org does: in practice, a
compositor might support only the kernel’s display drivers (the Direct
Rendering Manager, DRM), and libinput, and that’s all.</p>
<p>Another way of looking at this is that Wayland is simpler because
Wayland clients are more complex. Wayland makes the client responsible
for a heap of functionality that was previously provided by the window
manager, as well as by X.org.</p>
<p>Wayland client applications communicate with the compositor primarily
using Unix sockets and shared memory. Messages that originate in the
client are called <em>requests</em>; those that originate in the
compositor are <em>events</em>. A typical request is to draw a memory
buffer on screen; examples of events include mouse clicks and
key-presses. Conceptually, this isn’t very different from X11 – what’s
different is the hugely reduced set of requests, compared to X11.</p>
<p>Because the compositor is simpler than an X server, there is no
single implementation – there is no ‘Wayland server’.</p>
<h2 id="compositors-everywhere">Compositors everywhere</h2>
<p>In practice, X.org is the only viable X server for Linux. The same is
not true of Wayland compositors. Because the compositor is comparatively
simple, compared to X.org, there are many implementations already, and
probably there are more to come.</p>
<p>The reference implementation of a Wayland compositor is
<em>Weston</em>. When run in its most minimal form, a Weston display
looks like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/wayland_02.png" class="regular-inline-image"
alt="The Weston compositor in its default mode. Note that we have window decorations, but no window manager" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The Weston compositor in its default
mode. Note that we have window decorations, but no window
manager</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This display doesn’t look all that different from X.org with the old
TWM window manager that I showed earlier. There’s no separate window
manager, but you’ll see that there are window decorations that we can
use to move and size windows. The way to manage these window decorations
is one of the most contentious aspects of Wayland, which I’ll discuss
later.</p>
<p>Not only is there no such thing as a ‘Wayland server’, there’s no
such thing as a ‘Wayland driver’, either. Adding support for new
hardware to Wayland amounts to adding it to the compositor, or to some
existing driver infrastructure which the compositor understands, like
the Kernel DRM system. Clearly the latter approach is best, because it
doesn’t require changes to every compositor. Nonetheless, in practice
some hardware <em>does</em> require specific support in the compositor,
and this is an ongoing problem. Some compositors support some kinds of
hardware better than others do.</p>
<p>Because there’s no window manager, window management in the Wayland
world is a shared responsibility between the compositor and the client.
This means that if you want window management behaviour that is at all
unconventional, it’s not a matter of implementing a new window manager,
but implementing a whole new compositor. For example, the Matchbox
window manager is often used with X.org to provide a single-window user
interface for kiosk applications. Matchbox will show all applications in
full-screen mode, and all dialog boxes are modal.</p>
<p>Some Wayland compositors are flexible enough to be configured in
kiosk mode, but if you want a lightweight compositor that <em>only</em>
supports this mode – a Wayland equivalent of Matchbox – you’ll need a
specific compositor. One example is <i>Cage</i>; perhaps there are
others.</p>
<p>If it seems crazy to have to implement a whole new compositor to get
different window manager behaviour, perhaps relief is at hand. A
compositor framework called <em>wlroots</em> provides a C library that
can handle most of the fundamental needs of a compositor. wlroots is
associated with the <em>Sway</em> compositor, but it can be used
independently. A compositor based on wlroots can usually be configured
using the environment variables that wlroots uses, in addition to the
configuration provided by the compositor itself. This can be a little
irksome for users.</p>
<p>While many compositors are based on wlroots, some of the most
important are not. In particular <em>Mutter</em>, the compositor
currently used by the Gnome desktop, is not based on wlroots.</p>
<p>The Wayland protocol makes many compositor features optional. For
example, earlier I touched on the window decorations that could be seen
in the screenshot of the Weston compositor. Since there’s no window
manager, what is drawing those decorations? Well, it could be the
compositor, or it could be the client. The Wayland protocol provides
support for both, but compositor decoration is an optional feature. A
client can ask the compositor to handle window decorations but, if it
won’t, the client has to be prepared to do it.</p>
<p>This is one of many aspects of Wayland that require clients to work
harder than they did with X11.</p>
<h3 id="make-those-clients-work-for-their-living">Make those clients
work for their living</h3>
<p>We’ve seen that a Wayland compositor combines the roles of display
server and a compositing window manager, but we haven’t considered how
clients actually interact with the Wayland compositor.</p>
<p>While X.org implements a huge range of features that allow clients to
draw shapes and write text to the display, Wayland really has only one.
Under Wayland, clients essentially exchange memory buffers containing
pixel data with the compositor. There’s no support in the compositor for
drawing shapes or text. To be fair, a client that uses 3D drawing APIs
derived from OpenGL might be able to use the EGL functionality built
into Wayland, so it’s not necessarily a case of direct pixel-pushing for
the client. Still, most clients are going to do a lot more rendering
than they needed to with X.</p>
<p>This might seem like a step back in functionality, compared to X11
but, as I explained earlier, most GUI toolkits have been rendering their
own text and shapes for a while. There’s no doubt that this reduced
feature set makes the compositor a lot simpler, it it <em>might</em> not
make the clients more complex to write, depending on much use they make
of existing graphics frameworks.</p>
<p>In Wayland terminology, a region of pixels that can be drawn by the
client is called a <em>surface</em>. A screen window can be considered a
surface, but it isn’t the only thing that can – a cursor image, for
example, is also a surface. More on this point later. A surface is, in
effect, a miniature framebuffer. The compositor’s job, essentially, is
to merge the surfaces together onto a single display.</p>
<p>Clients talk Wayland protocol with the compositor using a Unix socket
– it’s not a network connection: network transparency is not a feature
of Wayland. The socket isn’t really used to pass surface data – that’s
the role of shared memory – but the socket protocol does specify the
location and properties of the memory buffer. Some compositor
implementations will share pixel data with a client using buffers in a
GPU device, rather than main memory. This might be a useful capability
for clients that do their rendering on a GPU, but compositors aren’t
required to support this feature.</p>
<p>Since not all compositors support compositor window decoration –
Gnome Mutter, notably, does not – clients have to be prepared to draw
their own decorations. Not only must the client draw the decorations, it
must respond to pointer events in the decoration area, and tell the
compositor to move, resize, or otherwise modify the window.</p>
<p>If clients have to draw window decorations, what stops every client
drawing its own window frame, buttons, etc? Well, nothing, as it turns
out.</p>
<p>For the application developer, this is a radical change from X11,
where everything related to window decorations was handled by the window
manager. Now, to be fair, X11 allows for applications to draw and handle
their own window decorations – these clients just told the window
manager to leave them alone. Most X applications don’t do this, however,
so it’s relatively easy to get the same window look-and-feel across a
range of applications. With Wayland, however, this consistency cannot be
guaranteed.</p>
<p>For an X developer, it’s difficult to see how this Wayland design
decision – forcing clients to be able to draw their own window
decorations – can be possibly be justified. I’m certainly not going to
attempt to justify it. Only the near-ubiquitous use of frameworks like
GTK and Qt make this situation remotely tolerable for the developer. The
frameworks will take care of the window decoration, either on their own
or using some general-purpose decoration library; but there’s still
going to be an inconsistent look-and-feel if applications aren’t all
built using the same framework. Providing some central place to make
configuration changes to window decoration (such as text caption sizes)
is not straightforward.</p>
<p>Similar extra work arises for the client in the handling of cursors.
With X11, the application provided a cursor image for a specific screen
region, and the X server drew it when the pointer was in the appropriate
place. With Wayland, applications are expected to draw their cursors
into a display surface. While this method is, presumably, more flexible,
it’s a lot of work for the application developer. Again, though,
application frameworks take care of a lot of the drudgery, so it’s not a
problem that the application developer has to tackle – unless he or she
isn’t using such a framework.</p>
<p>If you’re not using a graphics framework – and sometimes even if you
are – you’re potentially going to run into problems with compositor
compatibility. For example, <a
href="https://sr.ht/~leon_plickat/wlclock/">wlcock</a> intends to be a
native Wayland version of the traditional <code>xclock</code>. It uses
the Cairo library to render the clock face, rather that the 2D graphics
features of X11. If you run this utility using the Weston compositor,
you’ll get this error message:</p>
<pre><code>ERROR: Wayland compositor does not support zwlr_layer_shell</code></pre>
<p>The fact that <code>wlclock</code> doesn’t support compositors
without this capability is documented, but Weston is the <em>reference
implementation</em> for a Wayland compositor. Does that mean
<code>wlclock</code> is broken, and should find some way to work without
the missing capability, if it is not present? Probably.</p>
<p>But this is a <em>clock</em>, for Heaven’s sake. There could hardly
be a simpler graphical application. Yet it still demands capabilities
that are not present in the reference Wayland compositor.</p>
<p>Nobody actually <em>uses</em> Weston for day-to-day work.
<code>wlclock</code> works fine with Sway, for example. Certainly there
are X11R6 extensions that particular applications demand – but that’s
not a problem, as there is only one X11R6 implementation for Linux, so
application developers know exactly what they can expect from it. That’s
not true for Wayland.</p>
<p>In short, Wayland makes more demands on application developers than X
did. It’s going to be much harder to develop applications that don’t
rely on heavyweight frameworks like GTK.</p>
<h2 id="xwayland">XWayland</h2>
<p>Since there’s little chance of all existing X.org applications being
ported to Wayland any time soon, there’s a compatibility server called
<code>XWayland</code>. This is actually a full X server, whose output is
to a Wayland compositor. So X applications will continue to use X11
protocols, to this intermediate X server.</p>
<p>In practice, XWayland seems to work pretty well, considering it’s
inserting a proxy process between all client operations and the actual
display server. Setting it up is a bit fiddly, but users of mainstream
distributions will not usually have to deal with that.</p>
<h2 id="wayland-and-integrated-desktops">Wayland and integrated
desktops</h2>
<p>While there are simple Wayland compositors like Weston, in practice
almost everybody who is using Wayland uses it as part of an integrated
desktop environment. Gnome and KDE provide their own compositors (Mutter
and KWin respectively) that are tightly coupled to the rest of the
desktop.</p>
<h2 id="wayland-and-resources">Wayland and resources</h2>
<p>Its supporters promote Wayland as less resource-intensive than X.
Certainly, a rudimentary Wayland compositor like Weston or Cage uses
less memory than X.org, and a lot less than X.org plus a modern window
manager. But nobody’s actually running Weston or Cage on a Linux
desktop. It’s difficult to compare the resource-efficiency of a modern
integrated desktop on Wayland or X.org, because most of the resources
aren’t used by the core components.</p>
<p>The same confusion applies to client applications. Like-for-like
comparison is difficult, for anything but the simplest applications.
<code>weston-terminal</code> is a rudimentary terminal emulator, broadly
equivalent to the traditional <code>xterm</code>. On my system
<code>weston-terminal</code> users about 14Mb RAM, <code>xterm</code>
about 6Mb. It would be wrong to assume that a Wayland client will
<em>always</em> need 2-3 times the RAM of an X client: in a substantial
application, most likely the basic user interface will only account for
a small part of the overall RAM usage.</p>
<p>The question which of X.org or Wayland is more resource-efficient,
therefore, is not easy to answer: probably, running a modern integrated
desktop and substantial applications, it won’t make any measurable
difference. For embedded and industrial applications I suspect that
Wayland will use fewer resources, because you’ll be using a lightweight
compositor. Gains in this area could easily be lost, however, if you
don’t choose, or write, your applications carefully: Wayland will
<em>compel</em> the use of graphics frameworks like GTK, in
circumstances in which X.org (in principle) did not. And if your design
calls for the use of XWayland, that’s an additional burden on resources.
How this will all work out in practice remains to be seen.</p>
<h2 id="plus-ça-change">Plus ça change…</h2>
<p>For an end user, much about Wayland is uncontroversial, at the end of
2024. Many Linux distributions – the most influential ones – are trying
to reduce their reliance on X. To some extent, they are succeeding. Most
end users adopt a specific integrated desktop – Gnome or KDE being the
most common – and use tools and libraries written specifically for those
desktops. These tools will have a consistent look-and-feel on Wayland,
and a consistent method of configuration. Most modern display hardware
works with Wayland, although different compositors have different levels
of compatibility with different hardware.</p>
<p>Things are harder for developers. If your application’s user
interface is provided entirely by a framework like GTK, you probably
don’t have all that much extra work to do, to support Wayland. But
moving an application that uses low-level X libraries, or non-mainstream
graphics toolkits, to Wayland is a wretched task – it amounts, more or
less, to rewriting it.</p>
<p>In practice, I suspect that nobody’s going to rewrite old, pre-GTK
applications using native Wayland APIs. If anybody actually wants a
native Wayland version of <code>xterm</code>, it’s going to be much
easier just to write it again using GTK or the like. Of course, there’s
no point, because such things already exist. If I wanted to use
<code>xterm</code>, it would be because I <em>didn’t</em> have an
integrated desktop and a heap of framework libraries, or I wanted to
minimize resources.</p>
<p>The most worrisome issue for developers, in my view, is the lack of
feature parity between different Wayland compositors. I explained earler
how something as simple as a clock application failed to run against
Weston. This brings to mind the notorious ‘browser wars’ of the 2010s.
At that time, a web developer would have to test applications against a
number of different web browsers, because all had different
capabilities. This was a serious productivity-killer. Over time, browser
technologies coalesced, and the situation isn’t anywhere near as bad
today.</p>
<p>Perhaps the same will happen with Wayland compositors. After all, if
there’s only one X.org, Linux could survive with only one Wayland. Right
now, there’s little chance of this happening, unless the maintainers of
KDE and Gnome are willing to work to common standards. It’s <em>deja
vu</em>, all over again.</p>
