<h1>pico-photo-clock: an easy-to-construct Pi Pico desktop photo clock</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/chip.png" 
  alt="chip logo"/>
This article describes the design of a photo clock using a Raspberry 
Pi Pico, a Waveshare 320x480 LCD display, a Waveshare real-time
clock, and some Lego. It displays photos in JPEG format from an
SD card. No soldering or electronic construction is
required -- the components, like the Lego, all push together. 
The Waveshare LCD panel has a built-in SD card slot, already wired
to one of the Pico's SPI buses. I've given a general
description of the Waveshare LCD 
<a href="pico_waveshare_lcd.html">in another article</a>. 
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="img/pico-photo-clock-1.jpg" alt="clock with LEGO case"/>
</p>

<p>
I wrote the software in C, using the Pico C SDK. It is available,
along with a compiled binary, 
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/pico-photo-clock">from my GitHub repository</a>.
The same software could, in pinciple, be used for other displays
based on the ILI9488 LCD controller and the DS3231 real-time clock,
but the Waveshare parts all fit together nicely. To be frank, although
my software does work -- and the clock is sitting on my office shelf as I
write this -- it's really intended to be a starting point for development,
rather than a finished product. 
</p>
<p>
</p>

<h2>Construction</h2>
<p>
The photo below shows, from bottom to top, the LCD panel, the real-time
clock, and the Pico. Note that, with the Pico in place, there's no
way to get to the backup battery of the clock module. However, it's
claimed to last for three years. 
</p>
<p>
For a completely soldering-free construction, you might need a USB
right-angle adapter to route the USB cable in a more convenient 
direction to fit in a housing.
</p>
<p>
I've applied some thick rubber tape around the edge of the LCD panel,
to prevent light leakage from the backlight LED, which is considerable.
Depending on the housing you use, this leakage may not be a problem.
</p>
<p>
I'm not going to describe how to assemble the Lego -- I assume that,
if you have Lego, you know how to use it. Or your kids do.
</p>

</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>
<p>
The Waveshare LCD module presents a significant programming challenge.
It's not that it's difficult to interface -- on the contrary, it's
trivial. The problem is that it's very slow to update on a pixel-by-pixel
basis, and it has much more built-in RAM than the Pico does.
For speed, the LCD has to be updated in blocks, but the size of the block
is limited by the Pico's RAM.
Thus the way the screen is updated
has to be based on a rather complicated balance between speed and
memory usage.
</p>
<p>
This is why the time/date display occupies its own box on the screen,
rather than being merged with the photo. There simply isn't enough
RAM in the Pico to get the background and the text into memory at the
same time, for processing purposes. The processing could be done in the
LCD controller's RAM but, rather irritatingly, the Waveshare module does
not provide any way to read the controller RAM (the ILI9488
does expose a way to do this, butbut  th necessary controller pins aren't wired
to anything).
</p>
<p>
I thought it was very important to use proper, anti-aliased fonts for
the time/date display, rather than crude bitmaps. To do this, allowing
for the limited storage of the Pico, I 
<a href="im-font-test.html">store the font glyphs pre-rendered in JPEG format.</a>
</p>
<p>
<a href="pico-ds3231.html">Progamming the DS3231</a> in C is straightforward
-- it's just an I2C device that either reads or writes a compressed 
data packet carrying all the time and date fields together. This device
is imminently suitable for a microcontroller application, because the
time and data are managed internally, in decimal format. The module
knows how many days are in a month, and when the leap years are.
It <i>doesn't</i> handle daylight savings time, unfortunately --
this would require a way to set the region, and a substantial timezone
database. At present, my software doesn't handle this either. It would
be easy to do for a specific region, but to be general-purpose I'd have
to embed a timezone database, and find a way to keep it up to date.
</p>
<p>
Handling the SD card is the biggest programming challenge. Not only
is the card's SPI interface rather complicated -- particularly with
error checking enabled -- but the program also has to interpret the
filesystem. I'm only supporting FAT/exFAT filesystems, but that 
isn't really a limitation: it's how 
most SD cards are supplied. Fortunately, there are well-established
open-source libraries for handling FAT filesystems. 
</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
- No automatic handling of daylight savings changes.
</p>
<p>
- There is no user interface. To change the data or time, you have to
plug the unit into a computer and run a command using a terminal 
emulator. I don't find this inconvenient enough to go to the trouble of
writing a user interface, although the LCD module has a touch digitizer.
</p>
<p>
- Screen updates are slow. It takes about three seconds to draw a JPEG
file on the screen.
</p>
<p>
- JPEGs have to be pre-formatted to fit the screen. The source code bundle
has a Perl script for batch-formatting images on Linux. The Pico has
neither the RAM nor the processing power to scale JPEG images at
runtime.
</p>
<p>
- The finished unit consumes about half a watt. That's trivial compared
to a computer -- even a Raspberry Pi -- but it's not nothing. Still, 
it's very low compared to proprietary 'digital photo frame' units, 
which often consume 10 watts. A significant part of the power consumption
is from the backlight LED, which could conceivably be turned off or
dimmed at certain times.   
</p>
<h2>Further work</h2>
<p>
- Add a PIR module, so that the display can be turned off when there's 
  nobody nearby to see it. 
</p>
<p>
- Provide a way to change the date or time without creating a full user
  interface. One approach might be to read a set time from a file on the
  SD card. You'd write a time a little ahead of the current time, insert
  the SD card, then switch on the clock unit a just the right time. It
  would be less convenient than a full user interface, but only take
  half an hour to implement.
</p>
<p>
- Automatic adjustment for daylight savings. There probably isn't space
  in the Pico's flash for a full timezone database, but a specific zone
  could be selected at build time. 
</p>
<p>
- Display sunrise, sunset, phase of the moon, etc. This also would require
  timezone information, plus geographical data.  
</p>
<p>
- Add a barometric pressure sensor, and use it to provide a crude
  weather forecast 
</p>
<p>
- Build a proper case, if you don't like the Lego aesthetic.
