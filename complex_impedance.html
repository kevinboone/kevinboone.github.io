<h1>Why do we use 'complex impedance' in electrical engineering?</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/integral.jpg" 
  alt="integral sign"/>
When I was an undergraduate student in electrical engineering, forty-odd years ago, I learned 
in circuit theory classes 
that the impedance of a capacitor, <i>Z<sub>C</sub></i> was
</p>

$$ Z_C = \frac{1}{j \omega C} $$

<p>
where <i>&omega; = 2&pi;f</i> was the angular frequency, and <i>C</i> the capacitance.
The symbol <i>j</i>, I was told, was the 'square root of minus one', whatever that means.
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>Other disciplines usually use <i>i</i> for this quantity.</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
The impedance of a capacitor, it seems, is an imaginary number. Assemblies of components
might have a 'complex impedance' -- a kind of resistance that might be real or imaginary,
or some combination of the two. 
When I asked my teachers what a 'complex impedance' actually represented, in real-world terms,
the response I typically received
was "it's just a trick that makes the math easier" or, worse, "we don't ask questions like that". 
I took this to mean
that my teachers didn't know the answer. More charitably, these days I feel that they
probably did have some kind of understanding, but didn't know how to articulate it. I sympathise --
I, too, have an understanding that I find hard to articulate. But, in this article,
I will try.
</p>

<p>
To be fair, the answer "it makes the math easier" is a reasonable one. Many students will not
need a more detailed explanation that that. I can assure you that having a thorough, rigorous
understanding of complex impedance will not make it any easier to solve real-world problems:
the algebra and trigonometry will be just as fiddly. 
For better or worse, in engineering we have all
sorts of weird tricks that exist solely to make the math tractable. 
</p>
<p>
It turns out that if we take the impedance of a capacitor or an inductor to be imaginary, 
we can use familiar principles of circuit theory, likes Ohm's law and Kirchoff's laws, to
analyze circuits containing these elements. We could go a bit further, and say that
multiplying by <i>j</i> has the effect of introducing a 90-degree phase shift between
voltage and current, which is what we observe in capacitors and inductors. But it's not
clear why that should be the case, or even the circumstances in which it's true.  
</p>

<p>
This article is my attempt to explain, from first principles, why 
complex arithmetic is so powerful when analyzing circuits containing
capacitance and inductance. I'm assuming that the reader already knows how to
apply the method in practice, and wants to know <i>why</i> it works. I'm certainly not
going to attempt to explain how to solve real-world problems.  I'm also
assuming some basic familiarity with calculus, vectors, and complex numbers.
</p>

<p>
Fundamentally, I'm going to try to demonstrate the truth of this statement:
</p>

<blockquote>
Doing arithmetic using complex impedances amounts to solving a differential equation,
with <i>phasors</i> as the variables.
</blockquote>

<p>
Along the way, I'll have to explain what a 'phasor' is. The explanation will be a long one,
I'm afraid, as I'm trying to be as thorough as possible.
</p>


<h2>Electrical circuits as differential equations</h2>

<p>
I'll start by illustrating how we might analyze a circuit if we <i>don't</i> have a concept of
complex impedance.
</p>

<p>
Consider the simple RC circuit below. A capacitor and a resistor are in series, and supplied
by a sinusoidally-varying voltage <i>v<sub>S</sub>(t)</i>. The "<i>(t)</i>" here indicates that
this supply voltage is time-varying, and I shall try to be rigorous and use this notation
for <i>all</i> time-varying quantities, even though it makes the equations a little
cluttered. 
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/complex_impedance_1.png" alt="Simple RC circuit" class="article-centre-image"
  width="300px"/>
</p>

<p>
In this example, we'd like to work out the voltage across the capacitor, <i>v<sub>C</sub>(t)</i>. Let's
look at how we could work it out <i>without</i> the use of the mathematics of complex impedance.  
To do that, we're going to need to write an equation for the relationship between
<i>v<sub>C</sub>(t)</i> and <i>v<sub>S</sub>(t)</i>, and then solve that equation for
<i>v<sub>C</sub>(t)</i>. As we'll see, that relationship will be a differential 
equation.
</p>

<p>
Since R and C are in series, the voltages across them must sum to the supply voltage.
</p>

$$ v_S(t) = v_R(t) + v_C(t) $$

<p>
The currents in R and C will be equal, so we have
</p>

$$ i_C(t) = i_R(t) = \frac{v_R(t)}{R} $$

<p>
The current through a capacitor is proportional to the derivative of its voltage:
</p>

$$ i_C(t) = C ~ v_C'(t) $$

<p>
With some algebra we can combine these expressions, and end up
with the following equation relating 
<i>v<sub>C</sub>(t)</i> and <i>v<sub>S</sub>(t)</i>:
</p>

$$ v_C'(t) + \frac{1}{RC} v_C(t) = \frac{1}{RC} v_S(t) $$

<p>
This is a first-order differential equation which we may, or may not, be able to solve
easily -- whether we can solve it depends on <i>v<sub>S</sub>(t)</i>. 
Let's assume -- as we more-or-less have
to for what follows -- that <i>v<sub>S</sub>(t)</i> is a simple cosine function.
</p>

$$ v_C'(t) + \frac{1}{RC} v_C(t) = V_S cos (\omega t) $$

<p>
The capital '<i>V</i>' in '<i>V<sub>S</sub></i>' denotes that this quantity <i>V<sub>S</sub></i>
is <i>not</i> time-varying -- it's just the peak amplitude of the supply voltage. Of course,
<i>cos(&omega;t)</i> is time-varying. 
</p>

<p>
As I mentioned earlier, '&omega;' here is the <i>angular frequency</i> -- 
it's just <i>2&pi;f</i>, where <i>f</i> is 
the ordinary frequency in Hertz. Some writers use &omega;, and some use  <i>2&pi;f</i>; they
mean the same thing, but &omega; is shorter.
</p>

<p>
Can we solve this differential equation? We can if we already know the answer, and we kind-of do.
We know that <i>v<sub>C</sub>(t)</i> will be a sinusoid of the same frequency as the supply 
voltage, but of a different amplitude and phase. We know that because <i>all</i> that 
capacitors, inductors, and resistors can do is alter the amplitude and phase relationships between
voltage and current. These components
-- so long as they are 'ideal' -- cannot introduce any new frequency components. 
</p>

<p>
So we can write the 'answer' (which is a guess) as
</p>

$$ v_C(t) = V_c cos (\omega t + \phi) $$ 

<p>
Again, I'm writing a capital <i>V</i> here because <i>V<sub>C</sub></i> is the peak
voltage across the capacitor, and is not time varying. Our task is to subtsitute this
<i>v<sub>C</sub>(t)</i> into the differential equation, perform the differentiation
<i>v'<sub>C</sub>(t)</i> and, after a good deal of tedious algebra, end up with an expression for
<i>v<sub>C</sub>(t)</i> in terms of things we know.
</p>

<p>
I'm not going to do this calculation; I'm not even going to quote the result. There are a gazillion
places you can look it up if you want. My point is that the algebra is nasty, and the result
is not very illustrative. And this is just for a three-component circuit; you can imagine how
hard tedious it would be, if there were many components. 
</p>
<p>
If we were using a DC circuit, with
many resistances arranged in complicated ways, the analysis wouldn't be difficult. It might be
tedious, but it wouldn't amount to solving a bunch of differential equations. Using AC makes
things more difficult because capacitors and inductors <i>aren't</i> resistances. 
We can write
an expression for the voltage across a capacitor, and the current in it; so we can, in theory,
divide the one by the other to get an expression for the capacitor's 'resistance':
</p>

$$ R = v_C(t) / i_C(t) 
     = \frac{v_C(t)}{C ~ v_C'(t)} $$

<p>
The problem with this 'resistance' is that it's time-varying. Even if we can evaluate it --
and we can in this case -- we can't really use it in DC circuit theory techniques
because it's not a constant.
</p>
<p>
What we need is some analogue of resistance that works with capacitors and inductors. This
quantity, of course, is the <i>impedance</i>, and we'll see that using complex numbers removes
the time-variability and leaves us a simple constant. And that's exactly what we need
to simplify the analysis.
</p>

<h2>You spin me right round...</h2>

<p>
The fundamental insight that gave rise to the notion of complex impedance came from 
electrical engineer Charles Steinmetz, building on the work of mathematician Oliver Heaviside. Heaviside
developed a kind of transform that turned differential equations into algebraic ones, and
Steinmetz applied it to circuit analysis. All this work was done over a hundred years ago, but it 
caught on somewhat slowly. Steinmetz originally seemed to believe that engineers would not have
sufficient mathematical knowledge to understand his method -- and he was probably right. But, as I've said, you
don't need to understand the principles to apply the method successfully, as generations of
students and teachers can confirm.
</p>

<p>
Steinmetz said that we should conceive of an alternating voltage or current as arising from a
rotating vector. This vector was called a <i>phase vector</i>, later a <i>phasor</i>. As the
vector rotates, its projection onto the axes traces out a sinusoid, whose amplitude is
simply the length of the vector. If we project the rotating vector onto the x-axis, it
describes a cosine function; onto the y-axis it describes a sine. 
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/complex_impedance_2.png" alt="Illustration of a phasor" class="article-centre-image"
  width="300px"/>
</p>


<p>
In the diagram above, <i>A</i> is the amplitude of the phasor, it's rotating at a speed of
&omega; radians per second, and the voltage or current it represents 
would be <i>A cos (&omega; t)</i>. 
</p>

<p>
In Steinmetz's formulation, every voltage and current at any point in a circuit would be
modeled as a phasor but -- and this is crucial -- <i>all the phasors are rotating at the same
speed</i>. This must be the case, since capacitors and inductors can't change frequency. 
This means that, although we picture the rotation of the phasor as generating the sinusoidal signal, 
for the purposes
of illustration <i>we ignore the rotation</i>. To an extent we can ignore it in the analysis, also. 
Instead, we think of the rotating phasors captured at an instant
in time -- each phasor has its own amplitude, and will have a particular angle &phi;. This angle
represents the difference in phase between a specific point in the circuit, and some reference
point. In the RC circuit above, I might take the reference point to be the supply voltage,
and call that 'zero phase'. All other points have non-zero values of &phi;; that is, they are out
of phase with the supply voltage. 
</p>

<p>
What makes all this useful is that we can do arithmetic with phasors:  addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and so on. The diagram below shows what phasor addition might look like.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/complex_impedance_3.png" alt="Illustration of phasor addition" class="article-centre-image"
  width="300px"/>
</p>


<p>
In the diagram, the two red arrows are two phasors of different amplitude and phase, and the
green arrow is their sum. In reality, all three arrows should be thought of as rotating but,
as they are rotating at the same speed, we can ignore the rotation when doing calculations.
I'm not going to prove formally that the green arrow's rotation generates a voltage that
is the sum of the voltages generated by the two red arrows -- the proof is not conceptually
difficult, but it's a lot of trigonometry.
</p>

<p>
I've said that the diagram above shows phasor addition but, if you're familiar with
vectors, you may think it looks like vector addition. And, indeed, this is a
helpful simplification. The vectors capture the phasors at some instant in time.
If we know how to work with vectors, then we know how to work with phasors.
</p>

<h2>And so to complex numbers</h2>

<p>
We've seen that we can represent voltages and currents as phasors, and manipulate
them as vectors. I've stated (but not proven) that arithmetic with voltages and
currents can be represented as arithmetic with phasors. I've also stated that,
for the purposes of calculation, we can treat phasors as vectors. 
So far, however, I haven't
mentioned complex numbers. 
</p>

<p>
We could do phasor calculations using the arithmetic of vectors and, in some cases,
we might find ourselves doing that. In practice, though, it simplifies the
arithmetic if we make use of the fact that a two-dimensional vector -- which is
what we have here -- can be represented as a complex number. I'm sure you've
seen this before but, if not, the following diagram shows how it works.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/complex_impedance_4.png" alt="Illustration of vector as complex number" class="article-centre-image"
  width="300px"/>
</p>

<p>
In this diagram, the vector/phasor with amplitude <i>A</i> and phase <i>&phi;</i> can be viewed as
a complex number <i>x+jy</i> where <i>x = cos (&phi;)</i> and <i>y = j sin (&phi;)</i>. Why
would we do this? <i>This is the key step to understanding why complex impedances are useful</i>:
the voltage <i>v(t)</i> generated by a rotating phasor of amplitude A is
</p>

$$ v(t) = A ~ Re (e^{j \omega t + \phi}) $$

<p>
where <i>Re(x)</i> means 'real part of complex number <i>x</i>'. Here, &phi; is the phase of the
phasor, that is, the difference in phase between this phasor and the reference signal in the
circuit. &omega;, again, is the (angular) frequency of the signal, and <i>A</i> the
peak amplitude.
</p>

<p>
The origin of the expression above is not obvious, to say the least. It's isn't clear why
raising <i>e</i> to the power <i>j&omega;t</i> generates a sinusoid on varying time <i>t</i>.
This vital, but deeply unintuitive, principle was worked out by Leonhard Euler in the 18th century.
There are various ways to prove it, but I'm not going to do so here.
</p>

<p>
It perhaps still isn't clear why being able to write a phasor as a complex exponential actually
helps us. Bear with me -- I'm getting there, honestly.
</p>

<p>
Complex exponentials follow similar principles of arithmetic as ordinary exponentials, so we
can write the phasor expression above in a slightly different way:
</p>

$$ v(t) = A e^\phi Re (e^{j \omega t}) $$


<p>
In any particular phasor, &phi; and &omega; are real-valued constants. This means that the
time derivative of the phasor is just
</p>

$$ v'(t) = j \omega A e^\phi Re (e^{j \omega t}) $$


<p>
More concisely:
</p>


$$ v'(t) = j \omega ~ v(t) $$

<p>
Yes: <i>differentiating a phasor amounts to multiplying it by j&omega;</i>.
You'll remember that I started by showing how even simple circuits give rise
to differential equations that are awkward to solve. But, by using phasors, we've
effectively transformed a differential equation into an algebraic one. 
We can add, subtract, multiply, and divide phasors using the familiar rules of
complex arithmetic, and we can differentiate them using simple multiplication.
</p>

<p>
To be honest, I should point out that phasors transform a differential equation
into an algebraic equation <i>in complex numbers</i>, so the simplification isn't
as great as we might hope. Circuit analysis is often still difficult, but less 
painfully so. 
</p>

<h2>And so, at last, to the impedance of a capacitor</h2>

<p>
I started this article by asking why the impedance of a capacitor is
</p>

$$ Z_C = \frac{1}{j \omega C} $$

<p>
Here's why. Let's represent the voltage across the capacitor
<i>v<sub>C</sub></i> as a phasor, using the complex exponential notation:
</p>

$$ v_C(t) = V_C ~ e^\phi ~ Re (e^{j \omega t}) $$

<p>
We can work out the current in the capacitor exactly as before, using 
</p>

$$ i_C(t) = C ~ v_C'(t) $$ 

<p>
But we know that differentiating a phasor is the same as multiplying by 
<i>j&omega;</i>. So:
</p>

$$ i_C(t) = C ~ j \omega ~ v_C(t) $$ 

<p>
We can now divide the capacitor's voltage by its current:
</p>

$$ 
v_C(t) / i_C(t) = \frac {v_C(t)}{C ~ j\omega ~ v_C(t) }
$$

<p>
The voltage terms on the right-hand side cancel, leaving us
with this expression for the impedance of the capacitor:
</p>

$$ Z_C = v_C(t) / i_C(t) = \frac{1}{j \omega C} $$

<p>
This way of representing the relationship between a capacitor's voltage and
current works precisely because it is <i>not time-varying</i>. 
For a given capacitance, <i>z<sub>C</sub></i> is a constant with units of
volts over amps. <i>It can therefore be used as if it were a resistance in circuit calculations.</i>
A similar principle can be applied to get the impedance of an inductor.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
So, in summary, the effectiveness of complex impedances in circuit analysis follows from this chain
of reasoning. 
</p>

<p>
1. We can represent alternating voltages and currents as rotating vectors (phasors),
on which we can do arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
2. A vector can be represented as a complex number.
</p>

<p>
3. A <i>rotating</i> vector can be represented as a complex exponential, with time in the exponent,
governed by Euler's formula.
</p>

<p>
4. The complex exponentials of the form we use are easy to differentiate with respect to time, 
simply by multiplying by <i>j&omega;</i>. 
</p>

<p>
5. Using complex exponentials transforms differentiation into algebraic multiplication, albeit
multiplication by a complex numbers. 
</p>

<p>
6. Inductors and capacitors have voltage/current relationships that are governed by 
differentiation. 
</p>

<p>
7. Because differentiation of phasors amounts to multiplication, 
time-dependent terms in the voltage/current relationships of capacitors and inductors cancel, and we can 
model them 
as resistors with complex-valued resistance, which
we call complex impedance. We can analyse an LCR circuit using the same methods we use for
resistances alone, so long as we quietly assume that the voltages and currents are phasors. 
</p>

<p>
8. Doing arithmetic using complex impedances amounts to solving a differential equation,
with phasors as the variables.
</p>
