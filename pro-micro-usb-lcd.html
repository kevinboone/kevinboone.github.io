<h1>Building and programming a USB auxiliary display using a SparkFun Pro Micro, an HD44780 LCD module, and an PCF8547 I<sup>2</sup>C-to-parallel IC</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/chip.png" 
  alt="Chip logo"/>
This article is about how to use the ubiquitous HD44780 LCD module
with a Arduino-like microcontroller board such as the SparkFun
Pro Micro, with an I<sup>2</sup>C interface. The I<sup>2</sup>C interface is provided by
a PCF8547 I<sup>2</sup>C-to-parallel IC, which is inexpensive and
widely available. The Pro Micro code uses the standard Arduino 
<code>Wire</code>
library for I<sup>2</sup>C operation, and the <code>Serial</code> library
for USB communication. As a result, all the remaining 
complexity in the 
code is in interfacing with the I<sup>2</sup>C-to-parallel converter -- 
which is very fiddly indeed.
<p>
<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>I also have a article on interfacing the HD44780 to a Raspberry Pi using a similar method <a href="pi-lcd.html">here</a>.</blockquote>
</p>
I should point out from the start that Using an I<sup>2</sup>C interface is not
an optimal way to interface the Arduino and the LCD, if you really
<i>do</i> want to provide an auxiliary LCD display for a computer.
That's because, if all the microcontroller does is operate the LCD
module, it has enough GPIO pins to do it directly, using parallel
data operations. Using an I<sup>2</sup>C interface significantly complicates
the design and build, and generally slows down the communication. 
</p>
<p>
However, the article is only partly about providing a USB interface
to an LCD display -- it's also about how to use an I<sup>2</sup>C-to-parallel converter
with an Arduino,
to minimize the number of GPIO pins that are needed by the display.
This is perhaps of more relevance if you're building something that
actually uses an LCD display, but with other equipment connected, that
also needs GPIO pins.
Using potentially eight of the microcontroller's GPIO pins just to
operate the LCD display is not very efficient. Using the I<sup>2</sup>C pins,
we only need two data connections between the microcontroller and
the display -- just the I<sup>2</sup>C SDA and SCL lines.
</p>
<p>
I have to point out also that I'm not going to describe any of the technical
details of the HD44780 or the PCF8547 this article. I'll present the circuit
diagram, of course, but the hardware is described in
depth in
<a href="pi-lcd.html">my article on using the HD44780 with a Raspberry Pi</a>.
The sections of that article that deal with the HD44780 and the PCF8547
are as relevant to the Arduino as they are to the Raspberry Pi.
</p>
<p>
I will be showing only snippets of code from this application; 
the full source, and a pre-compiled binary, is available
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/pro-micro-usb-lcd">in my GitHub repository</a>.
</p>
<p>
I wrote this article specifically for Linux users. The circuit and the
compiled Pro Micro firmware -- the <code>.hex</code> file in the
GitHub repository --
should work with other platforms, but I'm in no
position to say for sure, or to advise on how to use them.
</p>
<p>
In operation, the display looks something like this:
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/pro-micro-usb-lcd-1.jpg" width="650"/>
</p>

<h2>The basic idea</h2>
<p>
The HD44780 LCD display has been around for decades, and is found in
all sorts of equipment. It can be purchased in single units for a 
few pounds. It has a rather old-fashioned parallel interface, using
between six and twelve, 5V (nominal) logic lines. A minimum 
configuration uses four data lines (so two operations are needed to send
one byte to the display), with the LED backlight permanently enabled, 
and the display
permanently in "write" mode. The other two lines are the "register
select" line,  and the clock (also called
"Enable" or "E" in some documentation). That gives the minimum number
of connections -- six. 
</p>
<p>
This minimal configuration is suitable for many applications.
However, if you want to be able to control the backlight in software, then
you'll need to connect something to its control pin. If you want to
be able to read from the display (necessary if you're using custom
graphics), then another pin will be connected to the R/W line on
the display. And, of course, you could choose to use eight data lines
rather than four, if you really needed the additional speed.
</p>
<p>
An Arduino-like microcontroller will typically have eighteen GPIO
pins, so there's enough to use the HD44780 in its full-blown configuration,
using dedicated pins. This is easy to program, as well as minimizing parts.
However, using this many pins for the relatively slow operation of
sending data to the LCD display seems rather wasteful. Using I<sup>2</sup>C
needs only two controller pins but, of course, the HD44780 doesn't have
any I<sup>2</sup>C support.
</p>
<p>
The PCF8574 is an I<sup>2</sup>C-to-parallel converter. It accepts 8-bit I<sup>2</sup>C
data packets, and outputs them on eight data lines. It can also work
as an input, reading eight data lines and providing them as a block 
to the I<sup>2</sup>C bus.
The eight lines of the PCF8547 are enough to operate the
HD44780 well in four-bit mode -- we use four outputs from the 8547 for
the four data lines, and the other four for R/W
, clock, register select, and the
LED backlight. 
</p>
<p>
This design is economical of GPIO pins, but very fiddly to program.
That's because we can only change the state of a specific line on the
HD44780 display by sending an entire 8-bit block over I<sup>2</sup>C. So the
controller program has to keep track of which lines are set to which values
at all times, so it can synthesize 8-bit blocks from the
stored state of the display pins. 
</p>
<p>
The complexities of the interface logic are described in much more
detail in my
<a href="pi-lcd.html">my article on using the HD44780 with a Raspberry Pi</a>,
and are not significantly different when using an Arduino instead.
</p>

<h2>The circuit</h2>
<p>
Bearing in mind the factors described above, here
is the complete circuit. Note that the decision about which output
pins P0-P7 on the
PCF8574 connect to which pins on the LCD module is <i>completely 
arbitrary</i>. P0-P7 are just general data outputs -- we'll need to 
take account in software of what is connected where. The pin assignments
in the circuit match those in my Pro Micro code, but I've tried
to make it clear in the source where you'd define different pin
assignments.

</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>There are a number of commercial HD44780 modules on the market, that include an I<sup>2</sup>C interface based on the PCF8574. These may, or many not, work with my controller code, depending on how the 8574 and the display are connected.</blockquote>

<p>
For future expansion, my design has the LCD display's R/W line connected
to an output of the 8547, so the display can, in principle, be read. However,
my code currently does not use this facility.

<h2>Arduino program</h2>
<p>
Because the USB logic is handled by libraries, the main body of the
program code is very simple. Here is a simplified version (the
full code is in <code>usb_led.cpp</code>).

</pre>


<p>
All the logic for controlling the LCD panel via the PCF8547 IC
is in the class <code>LCD8574Arduino</code> (of which, more later).
The <code>setup()</code> function just initializes the <code>lcd</code>
instance and the <code>Serial</code> library.
</p>
<p>
The <code>loop()</code> method just waits for USB data to become
available, reads a character, and then passes it to the
<code>write_char()</code> method.
</p>
<p>
The implementation of the <code>LCD8574Arduino</code> class is
in <code>lcd8574arduino.cpp</code>. I think most of this class
is reasonable self-explanatory, if you have the HD44780 datasheet
to hand. The core of the class is the method <code>send_byte()</code>,
which does exactly what it says. Because we're using 4-bit mode,
this method splits the byte into two 4-bit chunks, and calls 
<code>write4bits</code> on each. The <code>write4bits</code>
method calls <code>write_i2c_byte()</code> to set a byte
onto the I<sup>2</sup>C bus, and then calls <code>do_clock()</code> to
toggle the clock line for the necessary timing. Note that
each four-bit block of data requires a whole byte to be
written to the I<sup>2</sup>C bus. Of that byte, only four bits
are the data -- another bit is used for the "register select"
line, which will be 0 if we're sending a command, and 1 if
we're sending data. Another bit is used to control the LED
backlight; this value is stored as part of the program's
state, and merged into each I<sup>2</sup>C write.  
</p>
<p>
The <code>do_clock()</code> method sets the clock (or Enable)
line high for one microsecond, and then low again for
50 microseconds. The time between clock strobes in the datasheet
is 37 microseconds, but I'm not sure how accurate the microsecond
timer on an Arduino board is. It seemed better to allow a bit
of a margin. Again, we can't just change the state of the
clock line, because we have to write all eight lines in
one operation over I<sup>2</sup>C; so the other (non-clock) lines are
written again, with their original values.
</p>
<p>
Most of the character values processed by <code>write_char()</code>
are simply passed to the LCD display as data bytes. However,
the code does recognize a few special characters.
Carriage return and line feed have their usual meanings, and
a form feed (character 12) clears the display completely.
This allows a client application to reset the display for
a new text update. There's no vertical scrolling built into
the code, but it would be relatively easy to add. However, this
would require adding logic to read characters from the LCD display,
or maintaining a buffer that holds a copy of the display contents.
In a more complex application, these additions might be useful.
</p>

<h2>In use</h2>
<p>
When running the application code, the Arduino acts like a
USB-to-serial converter. With a Linux host, it will usually
appear as a <code>/dev/ttyUSB</code> or <code>/dev/ttyACM</code>
device. Sending data to the appropriate device should cause
it to be displayed. On some Linux systems, the modem manager
will try to get control of the device when it detects it, which can lead to 
conflicts. These are irritating, but don't usually cause
long-standing problems. 
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
Using an I<sup>2</sup>C-to-parallel adapter to connect an Arduino board to an
LCD display is not fast, or easy to program. An alternative
way to minimize the number of GPIO pins required, 
which is conceptually similar, would be to use
a traditional logic-level shift register like the 74HC595 rather than an
I<sup>2</sup>C-to-parallel device. This would be faster, and marginally cheaper,
but would lose the ability to chain devices that I<sup>2</sup>C has.
