<h1>Generating simple MIDI files using Java, without using the Java Sound API</h1>

<img class="article-top-image" src="img/notes.png" 
  alt="musical notes"/>
If you need to generate a MIDI file from a Java application,
in nearly all cases you're better off using the standard
Java Sound API, which has built-in support for it. Unfortunately,
not all platforms where Java runs has support for the MIDI API,
and even where it is supported it's a pretty heavy thing to use if
all you want to do is play a few notes of music.
<p/>
My interest in writing MIDI files using Java comes from developing
music applications for the Android platform. Android applications
are Java-based, but the API set is limited. In particular, there
is no MIDI support. This is very strange, because the Android platform
has a MIDI renderer and can <i>play</i> MIDI files. Even stranger,
Android did go through a stage of including the standard MIDI
APIs, but Google took them out. So now, if you want to generate music
programmatically on Android, the only practical approach is to
have your program write a file and feed that it into the built-in
media player.  
<p/>
Happily, if your music-generation needs are modest, it's not all that
difficult to implement a Java class that writes a MIDI file. 
By 'modest' I mean that you can get by with one track and one controller
channel, and you don't need to fiddle with such things as the tempo
and key signature in the middle of a track. Polyphony is possible, so
long as you're careful about your <i>deltas</i> (more on deltas below).
The complete source code for my MIDI writer fits into one 
Java class (see the download link
at the end of this article), and has only about a hundred
lines of Java, not including comments and test code. But this simple
class is capable of generating MIDI files that can be played
by the Android media player, and the Windows media player, among
other things.
<p/>
In this article I will describe the format of a minimal MIDI file, and describe
some of the nasties you'll have to contend with when using Java
to write one. At the end is a complete code example and some ideas
how to use it. 


<h2>Format of a simple MIDI file</h2>

MIDI files can be as complicated as you like, but if all you need to do
is output the notes for 'Mary had a little lamb' or something of 
similar complexity, you don't need all the bells and whistles.
A simple MIDI file contains, as a minimum, the following elements.

<ul>
<li>A file header. If you settle on a timebase that suits you
(see below) this will be the same for every file -- 14 constant
bytes</li>
<li>A track header. A constant four bytes</li>
<li>Four bytes to indicate the amount of track data, including
the track footer. This number is in big-endian format.
<li>The track data, which will usually consist of:
  <ul>
    <li>Metadata events, most importantly the tempo. Most of the
        defined metadata (key signature, time signature, etc) is
        used by editing tools, and irrelevant to players
    <li>Performance events -- notes, controller changes, etc
    <li>The track footer -- four constant bytes</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

I'm not going to describe all the header values -- they should be 
pretty clear from the source code below.
<p/>

Two (related) aspects of the MIDI file format are crucial for the
programmer, and not at all well
documented -- deltas and timebase. Connected to the issues of timebase
and delta is the fact that notes in MIDI are not specified by 
duration (e.g., crotchet, quaver) but by their on-time and off-time.
You have to turn a note on, and then a bit later turn it off.
<p/>
The timebase of the file is the rate of timer ticks used to sequence
 the various
MIDI events. All events have their times specified in terms of the number
of timebase tick from the laste event.
Speeding up the timebase increases the tempo of playback,
but the relationship between timebase and tempo is fiddly.
The basic unit of timing in a MIDI file is the quarter note. In principle,
a quarter note is <i>not</i> the same as a crotchet, and the MIDI format
respects that distinction  -- this is part of the reason for the fiddliness. 
However, for most musicians the distinction is
unimportant, and I'm going to assume that a quarter note is the same as
a crotchet, both in this discussion and in my source code. 
<p/>
The tempo of the track is expressed in microseconds per quarter note
(crotchet). So to get a tempo of crotchet=60, this value needs to
be set to 1,000,000. The timebase of the track is some multiple of
the number of crotchets per second, but <i>you set the multiple</i>.  
The set value can be (in principle) between 1 and 65,536, but I doubt
that the extremes of this range are particularly useful. Whatever
value is set for the multiplier, one crotchet will be exactly that
length. So if I set the multiplier to, say, 1000, then if I set
a note which turns on at time zero and off at time 2000, I'll get a minimum. 
A duration of 500 will get me 
a quaver, and so on.
<p/>
So how do we choose the multiplier? The larger the multiplier, the
faster the timebase and hence the more precise the time measurement can be.
This is very important if we're sampling an actual performance on
an instrument, but for simple note generation applications, we
don't really need this timing precision. In fact, in simple applications,
there's a good reason to set the timebase pretty low. Here's why.
<p/>
If you use a high (fast, precise) timebase multiplier, then you need more
bits to represent each time value. Not only does this make the MIDI
file much larger, it also makes the program logic rather complicated.
So long as each time measurement is less than 128 ticks, you can represent
it in the file as a single byte. Beyond that point you have to 
tackle the ghastly process of splitting your number up into
the 7-bit repeating chunks that the specification demands.
<p/>
In the source code below I set the timebase multiplier to 16 
ticks per crotchet. This means that the longest note or rest 
that can be specified in a single operation is a semibreve (=64
ticks) and the shortest is a hemidemisemiquaver (=1 tick).
Setting the timebase this way leads to very compact files, not
to mention very simple Java code. Of course, it won't suit all
applications. One slight difficulty you'll have with a small
timebase multiplier is getting accurate triplets -- 16 does not
divide very nicely by three. But there are prices to pay for
being able to write a MIDI file with ~100 lines of Java, and this
is one of them. 
<p/>
The other, related complication to be aware of is the use of deltas. A delta
is simply a time interval -- expressed in timebase ticks -- between
two events. It is impossible to specify absolute times in a MIDI file:
every event of any kind is measured from the previous event.
This measurement is called a delta. The first event in the track 
need not have delta=0, because it's permissible (and normal) for the
music to start part-way through a bar. But when you're generating sound,
not music notation, and you've only got one track, there's no compelling
reason to start with delta non-zero.  
<p/>
Thereafter, any event that has delta=0 means 'do this at as near as possible
the same time as the previous event'. The way that time is measured
in MIDI files means that there's no concept of a rest. If you want
to give the illusion of a rest, you turn the note off at delta=N, and
then start the next one at delta=N+rest_ticks. So if, for example,
you want a crotchet, then a crotchet rest, then another crotchet,
the delta values will be 0 for the start of the first crotchet,
16 for the end of the first crotchet, then 32 (=16 + 16) for the
start of the second crotchet. The rest is simply implied.
<p/>
The complexity of using deltas for timing becomes particularly apparent when
generating chords. If you turn on (say) three
crotchet notes at delta=0, you'll need to turn one of them off
at delta=16, but the other two turn off at delta=0, not delta=0.
 That, again, is
because events are always measured from the previous event. When you've
turned the first note off, if all the notes are to be the same length,
then the others turn off at the same time as the first, i.e., at 
delta=0.
<p/>
Musicians, I think, tend to visualize note timings in terms of
sequences of durations -- crotchet, quaver rest, quaver, etc. Thinking in terms
of deltas is awkward, but unavoidable in all but simple cases.
In the source code below, I include a method that takes as its input
a sequence of notes and rests of given duration, and derives the
deltas internally. This works for simple monophonic lines of
any duration, but if you need polyphony, I'm afraid you have to do
some math. Sorry. 

<p/>
Once you've got your head around ticks and deltas, everything else is
straightforward. Each MIDI event that goes in the file is preceded
by a delta (which will always be one byte in my example). Most
events are two to four bytes long. A 'note on', for example,
is the byte 0x90 followed by a byte that represents the note, then
a byte that represents the strike velocity. In my source code
I only demonstrate note-on, note-off, and instrument change events,
in addition to metadata events for tempo, etc. But all the others
are very similar, and reasonably well documented on the Web.  




<h2>Java issues with MIDI files</h2>

The principle problem with manipulating MIDI in Java is that for
the protocol 
is expressed in terms of both signed and unsigned bytes, and
Java does not have an unsigned byte data type. The decision to make
the byte data type signed only was, in my view, a lamentably daft one,
but we're stuck with it. You can't say, in Java:

<pre>
  byte x = 0xFF;
</pre>

because 0xFF is too big to fit a signed byte. It doesn't even wrap around
to -1, which is what C does. It simply won't compile.
<p/>
Although it seems inefficient, the only way I've found to deal with this
situation elegantly is to define all bytes as (signed) ints, and ignore
the top three bytes completely. This works because when you cast an
int to a byte it has exactly the effect of masking off the
top three bytes. In my source code, the method <code>intArrayToByteArray</code>
does this conversion, and is used before all file writes. 
<p/>
The crazy thing about this situation is that <code>intArrayToByteArray</code>
actually does not change the size of the data elements, only the type.
This is because JVMs actually manipulate <i>all</i> integers smaller
than 32 bits as if they were 32 bits. Computationally this makes sense
-- on a 32-bit CPU you don't gain anything by working in smaller chunks.
But it does mean that an array of bytes takes up exactly the same amount
of memory as an array of ints of the same dimension. 
<p/>
What all this means is that when we define a file header like this:

<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#0000FF">static</font></b> <b><font color="#0000FF">final</font></b> <font color="#009900">int</font> header<font color="#990000">[]</font> <font color="#990000">=</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">new</font></b> <font color="#009900">int</font><font color="#990000">[]</font>
<font color="#FF0000">{</font>
<font color="#993399">0x4d</font><font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#993399">0x54</font><font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#993399">0x64</font><font color="#990000">....</font>
</pre>

We don't lose anything in terms of storage over the situation we would
have if we were allowed to say:

<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#0000FF">static</font></b> <b><font color="#0000FF">final</font></b> unsigned <font color="#008080">byte</font> header<font color="#990000">[]</font> <font color="#990000">=</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">new</font></b> <font color="#008080">unsigned</font> <font color="#009900">byte</font><font color="#990000">[]</font>
<font color="#FF0000">{</font>
<font color="#993399">0x4d</font><font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#993399">0x54</font><font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#993399">0x64</font><font color="#990000">....</font>
</pre>

But we do waste some CPU cycles casting blocks of data from int to
byte, when this operation does not, in fact, have any discernable effect
on any values.  Oh well, that's Java for you.
<p/>
The other complication to be aware of relates to endian-ness. The MIDI
file format is big-endian, but its integers can be between one and
four bytes long. If all integers were four bytes, we could rely only
the big-endianness of Java data storage (which is independent
of the machine architecture) to write out
integers directly. But since they aren't, there are places where we
have to do the math and split an integer into byte chains of various
sizes. The source code below does this where it is necessary. You'll
note that I've made some simplifications where it's unlikely that the
full range of the number will be needed. This is just to speed things
up on the Android platform, which isn't overwhelmingly fast at 
Java math. 


<h2>The MidiFile class</h2>


The <code>MidiFile</code> class (see download link at the
end of this article) can be used as follows:

<pre class="codeblock">
<font color="#008080">MidiFile</font> mf <font color="#990000">=</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">new</font></b> <b><font color="#000000">MidiFile</font></b><font color="#990000">();</font>

<i><font color="#9A1900">// Insert some notes</font></i>

mf<font color="#990000">.</font><b><font color="#000000">noteOnOffNow</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>CROCHET<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#993399">60</font><font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#993399">127</font><font color="#990000">)</font> <i><font color="#9A1900">// 60=Middle C </font></i>
<i><font color="#9A1900">// Etc...</font></i>

mg<font color="#990000">.</font><b><font color="#000000">writeToFile</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#FF0000">"somefile.mid"</font><font color="#990000">);</font>

</pre> 

That's all there is too it. The attached code demonstrates various
other ways in which notes can be inserted.


<h2>Limitations of the code, and possible improvements</h2>

I've tried to find the simplest, fastest way to write an uncomplicated
 MIDI file,
which will work on the Android java platform. There
are many limitations, some of which you'd almost certainly want to
do something about in a serious application.

<ul>
<li><i>Maximum note length is a semibreve</i>. For music that is made up of
crotchets, and fractions and multiples of crotchets, I would recommend
using constants CROTCHET, MINIM, rather than numbers. That way you're less 
likely to write a delta that is too long and which will break the
player. Moreover, you only have to adjust the constants if you decide to
change the timebase. Remember that, unless you change the code, the maximum 
delta is 127 (just under 2*SEMIBREVE). Dealing with longer deltas
(which you'll need to with a faster timebase) is not hugely difficult, but
it will make the files much larger, and considerably increase the complexity
of the arithmetic.</li>
<li><i>Fixed tempo of crotchet=60</i>. Refer to the the definition 
of <code>tempoEvent</code> to see where to change this. The tempo
is a number of microseconds in 3-byte big-endian format. Some math
will be required.
<li><i>Only one controller channel</i>. The channel number is specified as
the second four-bit quantity on each even message. So to send a 
note-on to channel 1, you need to set the value 0x90 in 
the <code>noteOn</code> method to <code>0x90+channel</code>, and similarly for
all the other event types.</li>
<li><i>The only performance events handled are note on/off and program 
change</i>. But with a copy of the MIDI spec to hand, it wouldn't be
hard to add other events.</li>
<li><i>Data is buffered in memory</i>. The Java class accumulates all
MIDI events and writes them out to file in one go. In most cases this
isn't a huge problem, because the kind of application I envisage
won't be playing hours of music. But it would be more memory efficient
to write out data in chunks and them free the memory. Of course, once
the file was complete you'd have to go back and fill in the
track data length.</li>
</ul>

An interesting exercise would be to extent the code so that you could
specify multiple lines of music (voices) in terms of pitch and duration,
and have the program merge them into a single track, calculating the
deltas as it goes. This would significantly improve the class's ability
to generate more complex music, but it's beyond the needs of my
simple Android applications.


<h2>Source download</h2>

Here is a Java <a href="code/MidiFile.java">soure code example</a> 
that demonstrates three
different ways in which the <code>MidiFile</code> class can be used:
to specify note on and note off events at explicit deltas, to
specify notes as durations, in the understanding that one follows the
other without rests, and to specify notes as an array of values
and durations, and let the method <code>noteSequenceFixedVelocity</code>
take care of the rests.
