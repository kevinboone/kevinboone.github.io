ROM versus extensive package removal, for de-Googling a Samsung
cellphone</h1>
<p><img src="img/lineage_logo.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>In <a href="samsung-no-more-lineage.html">an earlier article</a> I
complained about how difficult running Lineage OS on Samsung handsets
has become, because of the lack of an open-source voice-over-LTE
implementation that works with Samsung modems. There remains the option,
of course, to de-Google a different brand of handset, that doesn’t have
the same limitations; but I like Samsung phones, and I have a heap of
them.</p>
<p>So what to do?</p>
<p>A possibility is to start with the stock (bloated and
spyware-infested) firmware, and gradually winnow away at the cruft,
until we arrive at something that is reasonably safe. Of course, Google
won’t be the only privacy concern in a vendor’s implementation of
Android, or even the biggest. Frankly, Samsung’s built-in software is at
least as invasive as Google’s, and there’s an awful lot of it on the
phone. Their built-in apps have been found to send data to all sorts of
shady companies.</p>
<p>Still, it <em>is</em> possible to remove the egregious Google Play
Services, and all its surrounding nastiness, without rooting a handset.
It’s also possible to remove a lot of the dodgy Samsung stuff without
causing too many problems. “Remove” is, perhaps, too expansive a word –
there’s no obvious way, even with rooting, to expunge built-in Android
software completely. But we can stop it running, using rooted or
non-rooted techniques, which is the next best thing.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-uninstalldisable-system-apps-and-services">How to
uninstall/disable system apps and services</h2>
<p>On a rooted phone, we can use root-based de-bloaters like <a
href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.sunilpaulmathew.debloater/">this
one</a>. This de-bloater works with the Magisk root manager (which must,
of course, be installed) to bypass selected packages at boot time. The
process is completely reversible, so long as you don’t remove something
that stops the handset booting completely.</p>
<p>Without root, we can use <code>adb</code> to make a shell connection
to the handset from a computer over USB, and run commands like</p>
<pre><code>pm uninstall -k --user 0 {package}</code></pre>
<p>Again, this doesn’t remove the software, but simply stops it running.
This process is more immediate than using a rooted approach: you can use
the <code>ps</code> command to monitor the Android Linux process list,
and you’ll see the offending process disappear after uninstalling its
package. Since Android processes which are based on apps nearly always
have the same process names as their package names, this behaviour is
easy to spot with a bit of command-line action. Unfortunately, not all
handsets allow <em>all</em> system packages to be uninstalled this
way.</p>
<p>In my experience, there’s little to choose between using the rooted
de-bloater and <code>pm uninstall</code>, on handsets where the latter
works: both have exactly the same effect. The advantage of the
non-rooted approach is, of course, you don’t need to root your handset.
However, there were a few packages I couldn’t remove using
<code>pm uninstall</code>, which I could remove with the rooted
de-bloater. For example, Samsung’s “Game Optimization Service”, whose
function is not very clear to me, appeared to be deleted by
<code>pm uninstall</code>, but kept coming back.</p>
<p>The problems with either approach are</p>
<ul>
<li>how do you find out what is safe/useful to uninstall, and</li>
<li>what remaining privacy concerns affect the bits you have to
keep?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-to-uninstall">What to uninstall</h2>
<p>There are many, many guides to “safely” removing Android system
components. There’s a good list of Google-related uninstallation
candidates <a
href="https://github.com/Systemless-DeBloaters/Systemless_DeGoogler/blob/main/bloat_packagelist.txt">here</a>
and a good list of Samsung candidates <a
href="https://gist.github.com/robertdanci/a36826de3a51ab27e19bb3da82fb0f32">here</a>.
<a
href="https://github.com/jayvialv/universally_detox/blob/main/Samsung.sh">This
is another</a>: better, perhaps, in that it contains more information
(or speculation) about what the various components do.</p>
<p>Many of the Google components are also part of the Android Open
Source Project and, being well-studied, are probably are not dangerous
in themselves. Removing them might save a little memory, if they
correspond to features you don’t use. It’s mostly Google Play Services
(GPS) that we have to worry about.</p>
<p>As a minimum, I would consider a phone “de-Googled” once you’ve
removed GPS (<code>com.google.android.gms</code>), and the things that
depend on it. If you uninstall GPS <em>before</em> those components
you’ll probably find out quickly enough – the handset will spit out one
spiteful error message after another. However, there might be some
components that don’t raise visible errors, but nevertheless repeatedly
fail silently, eating a chunk of the battery life each time. As a
result, it’s really only safe to remove Google Play Services after
removing all the stock google apps (Maps, GMail,…) first.</p>
<p>Of course, if you’re staring with a stock vendor firmware,
de-Googling isn’t sufficient: you need to “de-Samsung” as well, and
that’s likely to be more difficult.</p>
<p>It’s also important to bear in mind that one person’s useless cruft
is another’s valuable utility. Most guides to de-bloating Samsung
handsets advise removing DeX (desktop extension) support, but I use this
all the time. I, personally, don’t use face unlocking on my phones, so I
don’t mind removing it; but some people find it essential.</p>
<p>My point is that you can’t blindly follow another person’s
de-bloating procedure, and expect to end up with something that suits
your needs. It requires substantial experience, and willingness to
research what specific packages do.</p>
<p>My own de-bloating procedure is a pretty brutal one: on my Samsung
handsets I remove everything related to Bixby, Knox, Samsung accounts,
AI features, on-line payments, parental control, weather, speech
recognition, and fancy user interface extensions, as well as anything
from Microsoft, Facebook, Netflix, and all the others. That’s in
addition to removing Google Play Services and all the Google
applications. On my Note 10 5G, for example, in total I remove 132
packages, of the 321 originally present.</p>
<p>Of course, I have to install replacements for some of the parts I
remove. I replace Chrome with the DuckDuckGo browser, for example. I
<em>sometimes</em> replace the Samsung virtual keyboard with an
open-source one, but not always. The reason I don’t always do this is
that some of my Samsung handsets have pens, and the Samsung keyboard has
excellent handwriting recognition. Of course, you have to be very
careful about how much of your typing the Samsung keyboard is leaking to
third parties; the keyboard utility does offer some control over this,
but I’m not sure it’s entirely trustworthy (more on this later).</p>
<p>Whether you use a rooted or non-rooted method for uninstalling
unwanted software components, it’s a tedious process, involving a
measure of trial-and-error. And probably the occasional factory reset,
until you’re sure you know what you’re doing.</p>
<h2 id="what-privacy-concerns-remain">What privacy concerns remain?</h2>
<p>In a word: many.</p>
<p>I already mentioned my concerns about the Samsung keyboard but, of
course, this isn’t the only worry. Samsung’s firmware sends “diagnostic
data” to goodness-knows-where as part of its normal operation. This, at
least, can be disabled using the ordinary Settings app. Some services,
though, depend on being able to send private data. Any AI feature, or
voice processing, is likely to be supported remotely from the handset,
and the data it works on is necessarily private. Samsung has a privacy
policy, but it would be hard to hold the company to it, particularly in
the face of the determined hacking attempts that all IT operations now
face.</p>
<p>This is why I try to remove as much non-essential software as I can.
I try to find open-source replacements for apps that the vendor normally
provides. There are many open-source file managers, e-mail clients,
video players, keyboards, and launchers. Eventually I end up with an
installation that isn’t very different from the kind I have with Lineage
OS or /e/OS. Not only does this process eliminate a lot of privacy
worries, it makes the phone a heck of a lot snappier to use. Of course,
I lose a lot of functionality but, because it’s not functionality I use,
I don’t care. YMMV.</p>
<p>Still, there is this nagging concern: can we really trust Samsung?
Their software isn’t open-source, and isn’t subject to any external
scrutiny. It’s impossible to remove <em>all</em> Samsung’s software from
a stock Samsung firmware installation; doing that would amount to
installing a custom ROM like Lineage, which is what I’d be doing if I
could.</p>
<h2 id="so-which-is-best">So which is best?</h2>
<p>For a privacy-sparing, Google-free, Samsung-free experience, is it
better to run a custom ROM like Lineage, or to pick away at the stock
firmware to reduce the installation to a safer one?</p>
<p>It seems fairly clear to me that starting with a bare-bones firmware
like Lineage <em>if possible</em> is the better approach. Although
Lineage has <a href="lineageos-degoogled.html">a few remaining privacy
concerns</a>, these pale alongside the potential problems in the bits of
Samsung’s firmware that can’t easily be removed. These problems lead to
me disabling useful functionality, because the provider can’t be trusted
not to be spraying my data all over the internet. The ‘Device Care’
feature is a good example: it’s genuinely useful and, so far as I know,
the only way to get a good predictor of remaining batter life in these
handsets. Yet, it sends data to a server in China, for purposes that are
unclear. It’s just not safe to use, unless you can use a firewall to
block its network access.</p>
<p>Until recently, the Samsung keyboard integrated with a bunch of third
parties including, for example, Grammerly and YouTube. I think the
purpose of the YouTube extension was to make it possible to search for
things on YouTube without actually going to the YouTube website. I
understand that some users genuinely found this useful, and were
disappointed when Samsung quietly withdrew all these keyboard extensions
last year. All the same, I prefer to control where the information I
type is sent.</p>
<p>Of course, you can always disable the Samsung keyboard, and install
one of the many alternatives – it’s just a shame, because it’s so good
otherwise.</p>
<p>In short, removing <em>all</em> the stock Samsung features that could
possibly be a privacy concern amounts to turning your phone into
something like a Lineage OS device. If that’s what you want, you’d do
better to start with Lineage (or Calyx, of Graphene, or whatever) from
the get-go.</p>
<p>There are those who think they can just pick out the most troublesome
components of Samsung’s stock firmware, and get reasonable privacy with
the convenience they’ve become used to. <em>They are wrong</em>. If you
really care about on-line privacy, you’re really got to start with
something built for it, and live with the compromises that entails.</p>
<p>With a bit of effort, I’ve managed to get my Samsung handsets into a
state where they are not much more a privacy concern that Lineage OS is.
But the next over-the-air update – if there is one – will reset
everything back to defaults, and I’ll have to do it all over again.</p>
<h2 id="update-november-20-2025">Update: November 20, 2025</h2>
<p>Since I wrote this article, my attention has been drawn to an app
called <a href="https://samolego.github.io/Canta/">Canta</a>. As I
understand it, this app attempts to keep a handset in a de-bloated state
using the <a href="https://shizuku.rikka.app/">Shizuku</a> interface to
platform APIs. This should make it possible to use the
<code>pm uninstall</code> approach without actually connecting the
handset to a computer. I haven’t used Canta myself, so I can’t comment
on how effective it is. However, I though it promising enough to be
worth mentioning.</p>
