<h1>Is "high resolution" audio really worth the effort?</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/snakeoil.png" 
  alt="snake oil"/>
I'm somewhat loathe to put this post in the "snake oil" category, because
there is at least <i>some</i> merit to high-resolution ("hi-res") audio.
Whether it lives up to the extravagant claims made for it by its
proponents, I'm not sure. The world of consumer audio, like that of
photography, has always been built on a philosophy of "more 
is better", which often translates to "more expensive is better".
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>I'm specifically talking about the consumer market here; what audio representations might be appropriate in a recording studio is a completely different matter.</blockquote>

<p>
People need little encouragement to spend money, and it isn't hard to inflate
the effectiveness of your product using pseudo-scientific language. The audio
and photography markets are both ripe for this kind of manipulation,
so I thought it would be worth digging into the claims made by the "hi-res"
audio vendors. More (expensive) often <i>is</i> better; the trick is to
identify when the expense is out of all proportion to the gains.
</p>
<p>
In general, hi-res audio recordings command a somewhat 
higher price than CD-quality
recordings, which in turn command a higher price than lossy, MP3-type
recordings. In a way, that's fair enough -- hi-res recordings require more
storage (more on this later), and storage has a price. 
Studio equipment that is capable of hi-res
recording and editing is more expensive than that which works only to CD
standards -- an expense which is, of course, passed on to the consumer. Not all
suppliers have different charging strategies -- <a href="http://eclassical.com"
target="_blank">eclassical.com</a>, for example advertises (at present) a fixed
price for each album, regardless of format.  Quobuz charges about 50% more for
its "hi-res" offerings.
</p>
<p>
However, if a studio has the capability to record in a hi-res format, 
it will usually do so, regardless of what format the consumer eventually
buys. That means that if you're happy with CD-quality sound (or lower),
you're subsidizing those people who think they want hi-res audio, even
if you don't use it yourself, and even if it isn't really justified.
</p>

<h2>What hi-res audio is, and is not</h2>
<p>
For the purposes of this post, by "high resolution" I'm referring
to audio that is sampled at a higher rate, or with a higher bit
depth, than traditional audio CDs. I'm really talking about the
quality of digital/analogue conversion. 
When the sampled data is stored
or distributed, it might be in a compressed or uncompressed format.
If compressed, the compression might be lossy or lossless. 
I've come across claims that recordings are "hi-res" simply because they're
stored in a lossless format (like FLAC), rather than a lossy
format (like MP3). To my mind, this is not
a sensible use of the term: traditional CDs are recorded in 
an uncompressed format (which is, by its very nature, lossless). 
By "hi-res" I mean "better than CD", regardless of how the data
is stored. Of course, it's going to be hard to get "better than
CD" quality when using a lossy compression format, but it's
probably not impossible. In practice, most people who care about
audio quality will mostly be using uncompressed or lossless 
data formats, and data compression is not an issue I'll be going into here.

 <i>The sign of seriousness: my Astell and Kern "portable" audio player has
 dual SD card slots and dual USB connections. It sounds pretty good, in
 all fairness -- but does it sound as good as its extravagant price suggests?
 By the way, I bought mine second-hand -- I've already sold all the kidneys I
 can spare.
 </i>

<h2>How high is "high"?</h2>
<p>
My Astell and Kern audio player claims to support sources 
with a sample bit depth up to 32-bit, and a sample rate of
up to 384kHz (that is, 384,000 samples per second, in each
stereo channel).
In practice, recording studios typically distribute their
products (these days) with 24-bit depth, at up to 96kHz. If any studio
actually produces content in a format that will fully exercise
my player's digital-to-analog conversion, I've not come across
it. 
</p>
<p>
The capabilities of the Astell and Kern player are pretty typical
for portable audio players. In fact, even smartphones are starting
to advertise these capabilities. It's not that difficult to produce
the hardware -- the real problem with hi-res audio is the distribution
and storage. A 24-bit/96kHz recording requires 3-4 times the 
distribution bandwidth and storage capacity of a CD-quality
recording, and perhaps 10-20 times that of a typical streaming
service like Spotify.
</p>
<p>
Given the increased demand on storage and bandwidth, is the
extra resolution really justified?
</p>


<h2>Sample rate</h2>

<p>
First, let's consider sample rate. If, in principle, the limit of
human hearing is 20kHz, then a sampling rate of 40,000 samples per second
is adequate. Engineers refer to this figure as the <i>Nyquist frequency</i>.
Any more samples than this are wasted, because
they can't be heard. It isn't an accident that the standard sampling
rate for audio CDs was originally set at 44.1 kHz -- that's just
a bit higher than the Nyquist frequency, with a little bit of
wiggle-room.
</p>
<p>
In reality, most adult human beings do not have hearing that
extends to 20kHz. At my age, my upper limit is about 12kHz. 
Moreover, there isn't a clean cut-off, with 
frequencies under 20kHz being perfectly clear, and those higher
being completely inaudible. Most people's ears are most sensitive
at around 3kHz, and the sensitivity gradually rolls after 
after that point.
</p>
<p>
On the face of it, then, you might think that there's absolutely
no need to use a sample rate higher than that of a traditional
CD. Unfortunately, the situation isn't quite that simple. The
complication is that the Nyquist limit is theoretical. It 
assumes that we reconstruct an analogue signal by passing the
output of a digital-to-analog converter 
through an ideal low-pass filter. This
(ideal) filter passes all frequencies below half the
Nyquist frequency, and completely blocks all frequencies
above this point. This 
filtering process <i>must</i> be in the analog domain. We can
define a perfect low-pass filter digitally, but that's of
no help when we're trying to construct an analog signal. 
Real low-pass filters are made from capacitors and resistors that
have certain manufacturing tolerances. The more we try to
create a "perfect" filter, the more we fail, because as we
increase the number of components, the tolerances
get tighter, and less achievable.
</p>
<p>
So we must accept that we can create only a relatively
inexact low-pass filter, whose frequency response is a 
smooth roll-off, not a sharp cut-off; and then we can set the sampling rate 
to match the filter that we can actually achieve.
If we were to sample audio at (say) 192kHz, then the overall 
digital-to-analog conversion process will be a lot more tolerant of
inexact low-pass filtering. Sampling at 44.1kHz doesn't really give
us a lot of headroom, bearing in mind the kinds of analog filters
we can actually build in a commercial piece of equipment (not in a laboratory). A lot of studio equipment until recently sampled at 48kHz, and this
is the natural sampling frequency of a lot of computer audio equipment.
As an aside, I'll point out that conversion from CD-style 44.1kHz sampling to
48kHz sampling, and <i>vice versa</i> is difficult and error-prone,
and something we should avoid if possible. But that's a
subject for <a href="sample48.html">another post</a>.
</p>
<p>
So, to allow for the fact that we can't construct a perfect low-pass
filter -- or even a near-perfect one -- how much 
faster than the Nyquist frequency should we sample? The confounding
factor here is that many digital-to-analog converters  can 
<i>over-sample</i>. Over-sampling is the process of doing
interpolation in the digital domain, to convert (say) a
48kHz sample stream to a 96kHz sample stream. This is a relatively
simple process, and easily accomplished using modern hardware.
No new information is created by over-sampling -- we can't create
samples that were not there in the first place. However, an
over-sampled 96kHz signal is easier to low-pass-filter to 20kHz in the analog domain
than a 48kHz signal is. 
</p>
<p>
Given that the limit of human hearing is about 20kHz (or lower),
I strongly suspect that it would be difficult to distinguish
music originally sampled at 96kHz, from music sampled at 48kHz
and over-sampled during digital-to-analog conversion. 
Nevertheless, there <i>is</i> a difference. 
The claim that 96kHz sampling offers better sound quality than
CD-style sampling is one that cannot easily be refuted on 
theoretical grounds. Given that this is the case, it's worth asking
whether sample rates <i>over</i> 96kHz are worthwhile. Since
almost nothing in the mainstream recording industry is sampled
at these higher rates -- although the capability to do so does exist --
there seems to be no way to answer that question in
practice. But, since there
is currently no source material with these characteristics 
to test with, perhaps it doesn't need
to be answered at this time. Probably there is <i>some</i> merit
to sampling at 96kHz or thereabouts, although I cannot hear the
improvement myself, despite having equipment and recordings that are
capable of reproducing one (if it exists).
</p>
<p>
On the subject of sampling, I do want to take this opportunity to
squash a myth that continues to circulate. It is sometimes claimed
that, although the human ear is not sensitive to frequencies above
20kHz, the presence of such frequencies in a recording still has some
kind of indirect effect. It's true that some musical instruments
produce sounds with frequencies over 20kHz, and computer-based
sound generation certainly can. But, in the end, the sound that
comes out of the loudspeaker or headphone is going to end up
in the human ear, with all its limitations. There's simply no
basis for a claim that retaining inaudible frequencies in a 
recording has any effect on sound quality.
</p>

<h2>Bit width</h2>
<p>
The subject of bit width is even more contentious than that of
sample rate. That's because there isn't really an equivalent of
the Nyquist frequency for bit width -- we simply have no idea how
sensitive the human ear is to miniscule variations of sound
intensity. Audio CDs notionally use 16-bit sampling, which 
allows sound samples to be represented as one of 65,536 distinct
intensity levels (that's 2<sup>16</sup>). Can the human ear 
distinguish such fine gradations of eardrum pressure? Very likely
it can, and very likely the rest of the audio chain won't get
in its way if it wants to -- it's not at all difficult to 
record with this kind of precision these days.
</p>
<p>
When we get to 24-bit sampling, however, things are less clear-cut. 
Now we're talking about millions of distinct levels. That raises
two questions: first, is the ear sensitive enough to distinguish
these levels? Second, is the rest of the audio chain capable of
delivering the signal that precisely?
</p>
<p>
Concerning the first question, I think the answer is: nobody knows. 
That's not as unfortunate as it might be, because we do know
the answer to the second question, and that renders the first
question redundant.
</p>
<p>
All analog signal processing is limited by <i>noise</i>. By this
I mean the random fluctuation in voltage level that is simply
unavoidable. Over the years we've reduced noise levels more and more,
by clever design of equipment and meticulous studio practice. In 
the end, though, everything that is not stored at absolute zero
temperature generates some noise. It's a basic fact of the universe
-- electrons jiggle about. With the very best equipment and methodology,
the total noise level of the complete recording chain (that is, from
instrument to storage) is about 2 parts per million. That's the
same level of uncertainty as a 21-bit sample.
</p>
<p>
In other words, any improvement in precision beyond what is
achievable with a 21-bit sampling scheme will be lost in noise,
and contribute nothing to the quality.
</p>
<p>
Consequently, while a case can be made for using bit depths
greater than 16-bit, there's currently little justification in
storing more than 21 bits or so. Computers being what they are,
we'd usually round that to 24 bits (three bytes), but that
doesn't mean that the additional bits are doing much for us.
There's absolutely no justification in using 32-bit sampling.
Of course, the recording industry already knows that and, so far
as I know, no studio is recording this way. 
</p>
<p>
While I'm sceptical of hi-res audio claims, I should point out
that I <i>can</i> hear the difference between 16-bit and
24-bit recordings in blind listening tests, if I listen very hard. 
I can't articulate what the difference is, nor am I claiming that
I always prefer the hi-res to the CD recording -- only that I can
usually tell them apart.
</p>

<h2>Hi-res audio and format conversion</h2>
<p>
This is a rather technical point, but I think it's one that deserves a
bit of attention. Many of us listen to audio recordings using lossy
compression formats like MP3 and AAC. Even fussy listeners may at times
have to resort to this -- after all, <i>everything</i> can play MP3. 
Even my watch can play MP3.
</p>
<p>
So the question arises: if we have to make a high-bitrate MP3 from an
original recording, is it better to start with a CD-quality recording, or
a hi-res recording? The theoretical answer is that the better the quality
of the source, the better the MP3 conversion will be. Whether this
effect is significant enough to merit better-the-CD sources is, at present,
not at all clear. I suspect that the difference is small, but that doesn't mean that
it's non-existent.
</p>
<p>
In short, the fact that many people listen to suboptimal audio formats doesn't
necessarily mean that studios shouldn't strive for better quality. Further
research is needed in this area.
</p>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
So does hi-res audio deserve it's place in the snake oil hall of infamy?
To some extent, it probably does not. There is at least some support
for the notion that a modest increase in bit depth and sample rate above
CD standards is audible. The use of 24-bit/96kHz sampling probably does
offer a very, very small improvement in audio quality over CD -- at least when
played on top-quality equipment in a quiet environment. Beyond this point,
there's little or nothing to gain. The time to move to 32-bit sampling
is when we're recording, and listening, in the spaces between the stars; 
in all practical scenarios even quantum-level effects will be larger
than a single bit in a 32-bit sample.
</p>

<p>
My real concern, though, is that manufacturers are using "hi-res" claims
that have <i>only</i> a theoretical benefit. What's the point, for
example, of advertising that your smartphone has a 24-bit digital-to-analogue
converter, if 12 of those bits are just noise or distortion? This is the same
fallacy that is perpetuated by smartphone manufacturers who fit their devices
with gazillion megapixel camera sensors, and then put them behind cheap plastic
lenses. Sure, you end up with a gazillion megapixel image file, but most of those
pixels are just rubbish. 
</p>

<p>
There's more to be gained, I think, by using good-quality components and careful
electronic design, than in the pointless pursuit of absurd sampling rates. 
Digital-to-analogue converters can be superior or inferior <i>regardless of</i>
the sampling rate and bit depth. My A&amp;K player plays <i>everything</i> better
than my phone -- even MP3 files. That superiority isn't the result of "hi-res"
audio, but a careful design backup up by fat capacitors and a hefty battery.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, it's easier to advertise a high sampling rate (just like a high pixel count)
than it is to explain why your choice of capacitors is superior to your competitors'.
If left unchecked, the drive for increased audio resolution -- which I believe is 
driven almost entirely by marketing considerations -- can only push up the cost
of recordings, with very little gain. On balance, therefore, I feel somewhat content
to put hi-res audio in the "snake oil" section. I accept, though, that it might be
effective in moderation.
