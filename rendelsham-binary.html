<h1>Did aliens really talk to us in "binary code" at Rendelsham Forest?</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/alien.png" 
  alt="alien face"/>
Spoiler alert: no.
</p>
<p>
I have to confess to a fascination with the Rendelsham Forest UFO incident,
widely regarded as one of the most significant UFO encounters of all time.
It took place during my youth, at a place not far from where I lived.
I've visited the site several times in the intervening forty years -- it's
now a popular tourist destination, complete with a life-sized model of
the alleged UFO. Last time I visited, the UFO was covered in graffiti and
crude drawings of genitalia -- presumably not the work of aliens.
</p>
<p>
I don't know the explanation for the Rendelsham incident, but it's interesting
<i>whatever</i> the explanation. Even if it's an outright hoax, it's fascinating 
for what it says about human psychology.
</p>
<p>
Of particular relevance to me, with my interest in coding theory and information
technology, is Jim Penniston's notebook. It seems that, about thirty years after the incident, 
Sergeant (as he then was) Penniston revealed that his notebook 
contained sixteen pages of "1" and "0" digits that he says he received
telepathically. Since then the notebook has been "decoded" and found to
contain a cryptic message, in English. The message contains obscure phrases
like "eyes of your eyes", in capital letters with no punctuation. Embedded
in the message are the geographical locations of places of interest
to believers in alien visitation, including the pyramids of Egypt.
One snippet of text reads "origin date 8100", which has led some people to
speculate that the message is a communication from the future, rather than
from space travellers.
</p>
<p>
Over the last ten years or so, many people have commented on this message,
but it's clear to me that few, if any, of these people have the first
idea what "decoding" such a message amounts to. In general, to decode a
message requires that we understand the scheme by which it was encoded,
or are able to discern it. The scheme of encoding often says as much about
the sender as the message text itself; that, I think, is very much the case here.
</p>
<p>
I firmly believe that the binary-encoded message in Mr Penniston's notebook
is a hoax. I'm not saying that Penniston is the hoaxer; conceivably it was
a hoax perpetrated on him, by persons unknown, with unclear motives. However,
to understand why this is the case, 
it's necessary to understand something about how we
encode text using binary numbers. What's striking to me is that the
Penniston notebook is only <i>slightly</i> cryptic. The huge dump of
binary digits initially looks imposing but, in fact, it's actually 
relatively easy to decode. However, it's only easy to decode in a very specific
cultural context which, I think, is what makes the whole business 
suspicious.
</p>
<p>
In this article, I explain how to decode the Penniston notebook, with
actual examples. With this understood, whether you believe the notebook
is a genuine alien communication or not, you'll at least be able to
argue coherently about it. Otherwise, the argument just turns on references
to what various "experts" have claimed, which is never very
convincing in a controversial subject like this.
</p>
<p>
I will set out my explanation from first principles, assuming no particular
mathematical knowledge beyond basic arithmetic. If you're a computer
programmer, you probably already know the background.
</p>

<h2>What "binary" actually is</h2>

<p>
In this context, "binary" is a system for representing numbers of any size
using only the digits "0" and "1". There are potentially many ways
to do this, but the easiest -- the most conceptually straightforward, at least
-- is to use exactly the same approach that we do with our everyday
decimal numbers. We can represent numbers of any size in decimal, 
even though we only
have the digits "0" to "9" available. To represent larger numbers than 9,
we use a "tens" column, which will give us numbers up to 99. For numbers
larger than this we use a "hundreds" column, which will take us up to
999, and so on.
</p>
<p>
In the simple binary system, we don't use hundreds and tens -- which are
powers of ten -- but twos, fours, eights, and so on; that is, powers of two.
So the binary number "111" is one four, one two, and one one; that is,
7 in total. I'm going to call this method of writing binary numbers the
"conventional" scheme, because it's the scheme that's used in a computer's
memory, and the way we teach to computer science students. It isn't the
only approach, and that's important, as I will later explain.
</p>
<p>
Binary numbering is popular in the computing field because it's comparatively
easy to fabricate large-scale electronic devices that can work with voltages
or currents that represent only the digits "0" and "1". Binary coding is
so prevalent in IT that it's easy to forget that it is not, in fact,
universal -- early computers using other methods of representing numbers.
</p>
<p>
The "conventional" system for representing numbers in
binary -- the system that closely resembles the way we work in decimal --
is rarely used in communication systems. It's particularly inappropriate for 
long-distance communication over unreliable channels. The reason for this is
that this simple scheme does not provide any error detection or correction 
mechanism. In practice, for communication, we need something more subtle.
Determining efficient ways to do error detection and correction on streams
of data is the key part of the branch of mathematics known as 
"coding theory". For our present purposes we don't need to worry about the
details of coding theory,
because the Penniston notebook uses "conventional" binary coding. Penniston's 
coding is
actually easy to understand; the binary data used in practical
communication systems usually is not. 
</p>

<h2>From numbers to sentences</h2>
<p>
Computers are all about numbers.
Much that is of interest to us, however, is not numeric. Therefore
we need some way to represent as numbers things that are not inherently 
numeric.
</p>
<p>
A good example is text -- in English we use symbols like "A", "z", and "?",
none of which naturally have numbers. Whether we will be representing text using binary numbers, or decimal numbers, or anything else, we must first agree
on a numbering scheme.
</p>
<p>
A reasonable approach to developing such a scheme would be 
to start with A=1, B=2, C=3, etc. Some early computers
did, in fact, do this. For any numbering scheme to be useful, of course,
it must be widely adopted or, at least, agreed by all parties to
the communication.
</p>
<p>
Probably the earliest character numbering scheme to become a kind of standard
was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC">EBCDIC</a>, developed 
in the 1950s. This was soon overtaken by the ASCII system, which
remains well-understood today. A full list of ASCII codes 
is available at <a target="_blank" 
href="https://www.asciitable.com/">asciitable.com</a> --
we will have need to refer to these later.
</p>
<p>
The ASCII system provided numberings from 1 to 127 for English
upper-case and lower-case letters, digits, and a smattering of
punctuation symbols. The letter "A", for example, is 65. Why? It just
is. It is technically <i>irrelevant</i> 
how textual characters are
numbered -- all that matters is that everybody agrees on the numbering.
</p>
<p>
Although ASCII dominated text representation in computers for about forty
years, it lacks any way to represent non-English symbols. Various
methods were employed to handle European letters, but there was never
a high degree of standardization. For about the last twenty years the
dominant method for numbering characters is <i>Unicode</i>, which can
accommodate most of the world's languages. Of course, Unicode requires
much larger numbers than ASCII, simply because of the number of characters
in its scope.
</p>

<h2>The binary code in the Penniston notebook</h2>

<p>
Mr Penniston's notebook contains sixteen pages of hand-written binary 
data -- strings of "1" and "0" characters. The digits start off with
a reasonably consistent grouping into sets of eight digits, 
but this is not maintained. 
Generally, each line in the notebook contains three to twenty binary digits.
It no longer seems to be possible to find scans of the actual notebooks
online, although they are preserved in various printed books. 
The
<a target="_blank" href="http://binarydecoder.info/RFI-BinaryCode/Binary_Code_From_Jim_Penniston's_Notebook_(Full_16-pages_in_original_format).html">binarydecoder.info</a> website provides a transcript of the notebooks which
I believe is accurate (although I confess I have not checked every
digit).
</p>
<p>
This is how the first page of the binary data begins:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
01000101 01011000
01010000 01001100
01001111 01010010
01000001 010101000
...
</pre>

<p>
If we assume that these are eight-digit binary numbers with "conventional"
encoding, they convert to the following,
ordinary decimal numbers: 
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
69 88
80 76
79 82
65 84
...
</pre>

<p>
The first binary number -- 01000101 -- equates to 69 because it consists
of one 64, plus one 4, plus one one: 64 + 4 + 1 = 69. It's easy to find
conversion utilities online, if you don't want to do the arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
To convert these numbers we must ignore the spacing in the notebook,
which we take to be non-relevant. If we look up the ASCII symbols that
correspond to these numbers (e.g., at <code>asciitable.com</code>) 
we find these letters:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
E X
P L
O R
A T
...
</pre>

<p>
Continuing in the same way, the first part of the "message" turns out to be
"EXPLORATIONOGHUMANITY..." Yes, it's "og" humanity, not "of" humanity,
although that's an error of only one binary digit (remember what I 
said about error detection? There is none, in this coding scheme).
</p>
<p>
The message fails after this point, because we end up with numbers that
are greater than 128, and therefore not ASCII. It's reasonable to assume
that errors have been made at some point in the transcription, and it's
actually necessary to insert a half-dozen extra digits into the data,
to end up with something that is convincingly ASCII text. There's no
magic way to correct the data -- we just have to look for 
patterns in the binary
data, and experiment until the decoded message makes some kind of sense.
Of course, it's a vague kind of sense, with references to "eyes of
your eyes" and the location of the pyramids, and so on.
</p>
<p>
It's not a difficult problem, though -- we've already seen that the message
starts with upper-case English letters, and it's reasonable to assume that
it continues in much the same way. In 8-digit groups, most English letters
start with "010", and decimal numbers start with "001". Although there is no particular
system to the way the binary digits are laid out in the notebook, these patterns
are relatively easy to spot.
</p>

<h2>Problems with the notebook</h2>
<p>
On the face of it, everything makes a kind of sense. So why is the message
not a genuine transmission from aliens?
There are a number of <i>evidential</i> problems with Mr Penniston's
notebook, but here I'm concerned only with problems related to 
information technology.
</p>
<p>
First, the binary data is encoded using a simplistic "conventional" 
number representation
which, although widely used in computing, is rarely used in communication.
That's because it does not allow for any error detection or correction.
If an alien civilization or people from the future wanted to send us an
important message, I can't help thinking that they would use a system of
representation that is reliable. The fact that there are errors in the
coding that we <i>can</i> detect, just from the context, has to raise
questions about how many errors we <i>couldn't</i> detect. We can
only correct "og" to "of" in the first page because "of" makes sense,
and "og" doesn't. In the strings of coordinates that appear in the message,
it's unlikely that we could detect errors reliably just based on
context.
</p>
<p>
Second, the text is encoded as numbers using ASCII coding -- a system
that had a measure of universality from the 1970s to the
start of the 21st century. Other coding systems existed in the past,
and others exist now. Julius Caesar would not have recognized ASCII,
although he
was familiar with manipulating text mathematically. ASCII is a 20th-century
phenomenon.
Moreover, ASCII is really only useful for English text, 
Which brings me to...
</p>
<p>
Third, the message is delivered in English only. English is widely 
spoken, but by no means universal. 
</p>
<p>
Fourth, the binary digits are grouped into blocks of eight. This is a 
common thing to do when working on a computer, because memory comes in
groups of eight binary digits (<i>bytes</i>). However, in the 
Penniston notebook, one of the digits in each group of eight is <i>always</i>
a "0". ASCII coding only requires seven binary digits -- there are only
127 symbols, and 127 has the binary value "111 1111". But it's very 
wasteful in communications terms to use eight digits when only seven
are required -- about 13% of the data sent is
completely redundant.
</p>
<p>
Given that whomever encoded the message was prepared to waste one whole
binary digit in every eight, it seems peculiar that the message
has no punctuation, or even spacing. That can't be to improve transmission
or storage efficiency -- as we've already seen that this isn't a consideration.
</p>
<p>
Sixth, geographical coordinates are represented using latitude and
longitude, which is a highly particular way of coding a location. 
It relies on an understanding of where the Greenwich Meridian is, and that
a degree is one 360th of a circle, among other things. Even among
contemporary Western civilizations there's no exact agreement on the
way in which latitude and longitude should be specified (because the
Earth is, in fact, not a sphere). Would aliens understand these
subtleties?
</p>
<p>
Finally, what about the year "8100"? Is that an AD/CE year? Or a Chinese
year? Or something else? Different cultures use different calendars.
</p>

<p>
The reality is that the "message" in Mr Penniston's notebook is encoded
in a way 
that was used in Western civilization with specific information
technology at a particular point in time, using the English language.
There's nothing universal about
it, and the encoding is unreliable. I think that space aliens could do better. 
</p>

<h2>So where does that leave us?</h2>
<p>
It's unusual that low-level concepts in communications and coding theory
can be used to investigate claims of UFO phenomena; yet that seems
to be the case here. All the evidence points to the conclusion that
the notebook's binary data was created at about the same time it was
presented to the public, in the same cultural context. 
</p>
<p>
Cynically, we might even conclude that the 8-digit groupings presented
at the start of the binary data -- and not continued thereafter --
were to give a strong hint that ASCII coding was implied. The first
few numbers are very obviously binary-coded ASCII, to anybody who does
any low-level computer programming. However, it takes some effort
-- not a huge amount, but some -- to decode the rest of the message, using
the assumption of ASCII set up at the start. If it was too easy to 
decode, we might argue, it would look like an obvious hoax. When I first
"decoded" the message, I have to confess to feeling a sense of satisfaction,
like solving a moderately-difficult crossword puzzle. 
</p>
<p>
Whether you have the math skills -- and the patience -- to decode the message,
I think it's important that anybody who refers to this message as a piece
of evidence related to the Rendelsham incident, have some understanding
of how it was encoded. This, I think, is more telling than the content
of the message itself.
