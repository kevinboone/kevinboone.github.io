<h1>Using the Qpid Proton C++ library to understand AMQP</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/antenna.png" 
  alt="Antenna logo"/>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://qpid.apache.org/proton" 
  target="_blank">Apache Qpid Proton</a> is a library in C and C++ for
carrying out messaging operations using AMQP (there's also a very
similar Python library). Very often these messaging operations
will be between some kind of message broker (e.g., Apache Artemis) and
its clients, but AMQP can be used for peer-to-peer communication, as will
be demonstrated in this article. 
</p>
<p>
AMQP is not a trivially-straightforward protocol and, for better or worse,
developers sometimes need to understand the low-level details to 
make effective use 
of it. This understanding is, perhaps, less pressing for 
Java developers, who may just use a 
JMS wrapper around AMQP, like Qpid-JMS. But even in that case, it helps
to understand the protocol, if only to understand the error messages that
the client runtime produces. For example, it's difficult to know what to
do about the notorious "remote did not respond to a drain request in time"
message, if you don't know what a "drain request is"; and it's difficult
to understand a drain request unless you understand the <i>flow performative</i> and <i>link credit</i>. 
</p>
<p>
It's not really my intention to explain any of those things in this article;
my much more modest goal is to demonstrate that a good way to investigate
how AMQP works is to use simple Qpid Proton applications, along with the
built-in packet trace that Proton provides. This approach can give a
useful insight into what goes on at the wire protocol level, and there
are plenty of simple Proton applications to experiment with.
</p>
<p>
To this end, I am maintaining a small collection of simple, fully-documented
Proton C+ examples. The
code is available from <a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/amqp-monitor">my GitHub repository</a> as usual. Instructions on building and running the code
are in the README file in the repository -- you'll need the Proton development
headers and the Proton library and its dependencies. It can be illustrative
to run the examples whilst capturing raw network data, using a tool like
WireShark or tcpdump. However, I won't be showing raw TCP data in
this article.
</p>
<p>
I'm not going to explain here how to obtain
and install the Proton C++ library -- I did that in
<a href="amqp-monitor.html">an earlier article</a>. I'm assuming here that
you have the library and development headers available, and that you
have some familiarity with C++ programming. I'm also using Linux
as my demonstration platform, although Proton is available for other
platforms.
</p>

<h2>The code examples</h2>
<p>
For demonstration purposes, I'll show a simple AMQP client and server.
In the repository I referenced earlier, the source code is
<code>server.cpp</code> for the server, and <code>send_lots.cpp</code>
for the client. The server code just responds to incoming requests to
create a messaging session on an address called <code>foo</code>. 
The client sends a number of messages to that address.
</p>
<p>
As supplied, the client and server use port 5672. That's the default for
AMQP, so you may need to ensure that you aren't running any other AMQP-aware
software on the same host as the server process. Also by default, the client
connects to the server on <code>localhost</code>, but that's easy to change
in the source.
</p>
The Proton library primarily works through callbacks. That is, the application
provides a class that implements certain methods, and the library calls
those methods at the appropriate stages of the AMQP conversation. 
In my code examples, most of these methods -- even when they are not
relevant to the specific application -- generate some log output, to make
it easier to trace what is going on.
<p>
</p>

<h2>Running the client and server</h2>
<p>
Assuming you've built the samples (which, in most cases, should
amount to running <code>make</code>) you can run both the client and
server with AMQP tracing enabled, like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ PN_TRACE_FRM=1 ./bin/server
</pre>

<p>
And in a different terminal:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
$ PN_TRACE_FRM=1 ./bin/send_lots
</pre>

<h2>Examining the output</h2>
<p>
Here is the sample output from <code>send_lots</code> -- I've removed some
duplicate and irrelevant lines, to make it easier to follow.
</p>

<p>
I'm not going to explain the AMQP protocol in this article, but a few
interesting features are worth some attention.
</p>

<p>
&bull; The conversation starts with SASL authentication, even though the
server does not require credentials. This is, therefore, 'anonymous' authentication, as shown by the token <code>mechanism=:ANONYMOUS</code>.
</p>

<p>
&bull; The client (sender) then sends the <code>@open</code>, 
<code>@begin</code>, and <code>@link</code> frames. The tokens
'open', etc., are called 'performatives' in AMQP jargon. 
<code>open</code> initiates the communication, and exchanges capabilities
and limits. <code>begin</code> opens a session -- a 'session' in AMQP
terminology is a pair of unidirectional communication channels, one inbound
and one outbound. TCP is, of course, full-duplex; but AMQP could conceivably
be used with other communications infrastructure. Note that the 
receiver responds with its own <code>@open</code>, 
<code>@begin</code>, and <code>@link</code>, but the sender does not
wait for each response before sending its next frame. This willingness
to proceed without specific confirmation is called 'pipelining' in AMQP.
</p>

<p>
&bull; The sender can not proceed until the receiver has sent a 
<code>@flow</code> packet, setting out the amount of link credit it will
allow. Link credit is usually specified in terms of messages, so the 
token <code>link-credit=0xa</code> means "you can send ten messages
without checking with me again" (hexadecimal 0x0A = 10). 
</p>

<p>
&bull; As the sender proceeds to send messages, the Proton library
generates a bunch of <code>@transfer</code> frames. These contain the
actual message data. Note that the sender does not wait for any
confirmation -- in fact, all ten of the message payloads in this example
will probably be packed into a single TCP packet.
So when does the sender get an acknowledgement from the
receiver? 
</p>

<p>
&bull; The receiver sends a bunch of <code>@disposition</code> frames,
indicating what it has done with the messages. <code>state=@accepted</code>
represents a positive acknowledgement -- the message was received and
processed. Of course, what 'processed' amounts to depends on the application.
</p>

<p>
&bull; The sender and receiver both send <code>@close</code> frames, to
indicate that they are finished with the current 
connection. They might send <code>@detach</code> and
<code>@end</code> as well, but the specification does not require this. 
</p>

<p>
If you're programming with Proton, it's helpful to note how the way that
Proton invokes the application's callback handlers 
(like <code>on_sendable()</code>) is interleaved with the actual AMQP frames.  
In particular, these callbacks are not necessarily called exactly when 
the corresponding AMQP action takes place. Notice, for example, how
a bunch of "accepted" disposition frames are received before the 
application's <code>on_tracker_accept()</code> method gets called for the
first time.
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
The AMQP specification does not make for easy reading and, if you're 
using high-level AMQP libraries like Qpid-JMS the details might not be
important. For low-level programming -- particularly when programming
Proton server applications -- knowing the fine details really matters.
Using Proton's built-in packet trace, along with at least an outline 
understanding of the AMQP protocol, is a good way to debug this kind
of application.
