writing: what do we lose, when we write more readably?</h1>
<p><img src="img/report.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>It’s easy, especially in science and technology, to write text that
nobody wants to read. Scientific writing is often over-long,
over-reliant on the passive voice, and full of vague abstractions. We
often avoid referring to specific individuals, even to ourselves, the
writers. Generality and objectivity are worthy goals in science, but
readers prefer the specific and the personal.</p>
<p>You don’t have to look very far to find guidance on how to write
readable English text. There was an explosion of publication on this
subject between the end of the 19th and the mid-20th centuries. It’s
still worth reading early examples like Mark Twain’s <em>Fenimore
Cooper’s Literary Offenses</em> (1895), and the Fowler brothers’ <em>The
King’s English</em> (1908). This eventually became <em>Fowler’s
Dictionary of Modern English Usage</em>, which is still in print. Of
course, there are modern books on writing style too, including some for
scientists, like Anne Greene’s <em>Writing Science in Plain
English</em>.</p>
<p>Novice writers have to struggle with issues of grammar and spelling,
but computers increasingly help here. This article is more about
problems of <em>style</em>, which goes beyond simple rules that can be
learned. Still, it’s easy enough to distill general principles of good
English style from the various publications on the subject. Here are a
few which have been suggested for at least a hundred years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid the passive voice, if possible.</li>
<li>Use verbs rather than compound noun phrases</li>
<li>Give concrete examples rather than abstractions</li>
<li>Avoid general linking verbs like ‘is’ – describe particular actions
instead</li>
<li>Include people, if possible</li>
</ul>
<p>My question, in this article, is whether applying these principles to
scientific and technical writing loses subtleties that a reader would
have understood. The answer will be “maybe”, but it might still be worth
doing.</p>
<p>I’m taking as my example a slightly modified version of a sentence
that I read in an academic article about healthcare in the developing
world. Sadly, I could have closed my eyes and stuck a pin randomly into
any scholarly journal, and found something just as apposite. My example
doesn’t demonstrate <em>terrible</em> English writing: frankly, it’s the
kind of stuff I’m used to reading. Still, I think I can apply various
stylistic principles to it, and end up with something that might have
satisfied Mark Twain.</p>
<p>Sentence <em>a</em> is the original; here it is in all its stuffy
glory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>a</em> It could no longer be denied that the poor health of the
Country’s population seemed to be attributable to insufficient
cultivation of agricultural produce.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So – where to start? I’m not very keen on “seemed to be
attributable”. All too often, “to seem” is a weak, indefinite verb,
which we ought to treat with a bit of suspicion. So let’s start by
removing the “seemed”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>b</em> It could no longer be denied that the poor health of the
Country’s population could be attributed to insufficient cultivation of
agricultural produce.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Could be attributed” is only marginally better than “seemed to be
attributable”, but it’s shorter, and a bit less vague. Still, we’ll have
to come back to it later.</p>
<p>What about this “insufficient cultivation of agricultural produce”? I
imagine that the problem here is simply a lack of <em>food</em>, not all
kinds of agricultural output. So:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>c</em> It could no longer be denied that the poor health of the
Country’s population could be attributed to insufficient production of
food</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What about “could no longer be denied”? This is a stock phrase, and
doesn’t really provide a lot of information. Perhaps “was found”
instead?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>d</em> It was found that the poor health of the Country’s
population could be attributed to insufficient production of food</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“It was found” is still a passive voice expression, and we can easily
make it active if we wish:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>e</em> We found that the poor health of the Country’s population
could be attributed to insufficient production of food</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, we can only write “we found” if “we” were the ones who did
the finding. Depending on the circumstances, we might say “The public
health service found…”, or “Red Cross medics found…”, or whatever. It’s
certainly worth making the sentence start with the active voice if it
matters, even a little, who actually did the finding. We can only
justify the clumsiness of the passive voice if we’re adamant that we
don’t want to identify the subject of the verb.</p>
<p>Let’s come back to “could be attributed to”. Perhaps we could
simplify this to “resulted from” or “followed”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>f</em> We found that the poor health of the Country’s population
resulted from insufficient production of food</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not entirely happy with this, because it still leaves the main
actor in the sentence vague. But let’s press on.</p>
<p>“Insufficient production of food” gives us three nouns in a row. It
might be better to turn the noun “production” into the verb “produce”.
We’re saying the same thing, but in a more immediate way. In addition,
“the Country’s population” can probably be shortened to “people”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>g</em> We found that people were unhealthy because the Country
didn’t produce enough to feed everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This change gives us the bonus of removing the vagueness of “resulted
from”.</p>
<p>What next? “Unhealthy” is an abstract state. It does actually matter
what health problems people suffered from: mostly scurvy and rickets, in
this article, because of insufficient fresh fruit and dairy produce.
Using these more definite terms gives us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>h</em> We found that people were suffering from scurvy and
rickets, among other conditions, because the Country didn’t produce
enough to feed everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“The Country didn’t produce enough” is a little impersonal – it’s not
the “Country” that produces food, but people in it; but we can make the
sentence even more personal by modifying it to focus on what people
really experienced: they didn’t get enough food.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>i</em> We found that people were suffering from scurvy and
rickets, among other conditions, because they didn’t get enough to
eat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m a little worried about “scurvy and rickets, among other
conditions”. It really isn’t any better than “scurvy and rickets, etc”,
and “etc” is a real no-no. It doesn’t help the reader to know that
people suffered from “other conditions”, if we decline decline to tell
them what these other conditions were. Either the reader knows what
kinds of medical problems are associated with malnutrition, or not. If
not, saying “and other conditions” doesn’t add anything. So we can,
perhaps, leave this phrase out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>j</em> We found that people were suffering from scurvy and
rickets because they didn’t get enough to eat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“were”, in this case, isn’t just a linking verb – it’s not merely
saying that two things are connected. Still, we might consider
shortening this phrase, just to make the sentence a little snappier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>k</em> We found that people suffered from scurvy and rickets
because they didn’t get enough to eat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These previous changes are all fairly minor; we can hugely increase
the impact of the sentence by making it refer to specific individuals.
If the article had earlier mentioned some particular group of people,
even as only an illustrative example, we can refer to them here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>l</em> We found that Tomasina and her co-workers suffered from
scurvy and rickets because they didn’t get enough to eat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We could go on, if we had the time and enthusiasm, but I think
sentence <em>l</em> probably satisfies Mark Twain’s criteria for sound
writing. The original sentence <em>a</em> almost certainly doesn’t.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>While sentence <em>l</em> has the advantage over sentence <em>a</em>
that somebody might actually read it, each of the changes between
sentences <em>a</em> and <em>l</em> modifies the meaning a little.</p>
<p>I struck out “it could no longer be denied” because of its verbosity,
but it doesn’t mean precisely the same as “we found”. “It could no
longer be denied” quietly implies that, at some point, somebody
<em>was</em> denying it. Perhaps the writers accepted the conclusion –
that lack of food caused health problems – only with reluctance, when
the weight of evidence became insurmountable? “We found…” is completely
neutral in this respect – maybe we were surprised by the result, maybe
we weren’t. Does this matter? In some circumstances it might.</p>
<p>I modified “the Country’s population” to “people”, again for
conciseness, but also with a subtle change of meaning. When we refer to
an unhealthy “population” it implies that many people are sick – perhaps
<em>everybody</em> is sick. “People” could legitimately refer to a
single region, or even a single village. We could, perhaps, say “many
people suffered…” but, unless we’re prepared to quantify “many”, the
word doesn’t add much context. Perhaps, instead, we could say “people
all over the Country…”, but that’s no shorter or more engaging than “the
Country’s population”. Brevity, here, comes with costs.</p>
<p>And what about moving from “poor health” to “scurvy and rickets”? I’m
following the Fowler brothers’ advice to prefer the concrete to the
abstract, and added some useful, accurate information. But have I gone
too far? Scurvy and rickets are (usually) disorders of malnutrition; at
least, they are organic conditions amenable to medical treatment. But
what about the <em>mental</em> health problems that might afflict the
unfortunate populace? By drawing attention to particular, organic
medical problems, I imply either that scurvy and rickets are the only
relevant problems, or at least any other problems were similar. And
that, in fact, was untrue in this case.</p>
<p>I replaced “agricultural produce” with “food”. But “produce” implies
a deliberate, organized attempt to farm food for the population. If I’m
short of “food”, that might be unrelated to agricultural activity;
perhaps my foraging activities were hindered for some reason? In my
country, we forage only for fun, not out of necessity; the country in
sentence <em>a</em> was one one where many people depended on wild food
to supplement their diets.</p>
<p>So much for the problems, but are there any solutions? That is, could
I rewrite sentence <em>a</em> so that it is both short and impactful,
and carried exactly the same information? I tried very hard, but I
couldn’t find a way. Every change that made the sentence easier to read,
made it mean something just slightly different.</p>
<p>In my view, it’s fine to write in a way that preserves a subtle
meaning, if</p>
<ul>
<li>we’re doing so <em>intentionally</em>, and</li>
<li>the reader will actually understand the subtlety.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, I might write “cultivation of agricultural produce” in
preference to “food” if I know, and I know that the reader knows, that
there are kinds of “food” that are different from “agricultural
produce”. That’s different from writing “agricultural produce” because
I’m too lazy to think about whether there’s a simpler way to express the
same thing. Or, worse, because “food” isn’t highbrow enough.</p>
<p>Even if I’m using this phrase deliberately, and I want to make the
point that I’m only considering commercial-scale agricultural
activities, I still have to wonder whether the reader will pick up on
the distinction, just from the wording I’ve used. Perhaps it would be
better to make the point explicitly, if it’s important to the
message?</p>
<p>In summary, I think we can apply common guidelines on style to
technical writing, and end up with more readable text. However, I’m not
convinced that we can always do this without losing subtle shades of
meaning.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of experience for a writer to know whether revising a
document to use a more readable style will lose or change information.
More importantly, perhaps, it takes a lot of thought and time.</p>
