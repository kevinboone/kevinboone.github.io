<h1>Some thoughts on using a USB keyboard with the Raspberry Pi Pico</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/chip.png" 
  alt="Chip logo"/>
The Pi Pico has USB host support, and can work with a USB keyboard. 
Such a keyboard makes a useful -- and cheap -- input device, although
using one has implications for project design and testing. 
Moreover, although
there are some programming examples, the general approach to programming
USB host operations is not well documented. 
</p>
<p>
In this article I describe the basic operation of the TinyUSB library
in the Pico C SDK. I also touch on the use of an LCD matrix for
troubleshooting -- since the USB can't also be used for a diagnostic
connection.  
<p>
I'm only giving snippets of C source code in this article; full source code
for the text application (with LCD display) is in
<a target="_blank" 
  href="https://github.com/kevinboone/pico_usb_kbd_lcd">my GitHub repository</a>.
</p>
<p>
The article only covers HID devices, specifically keyboards, although mouse
handling is almost identical. Whether it's possible to use something
as complex as a USB mass storage device, I have no idea.
</p>

<blockquote class="notebox"><b>Note:</b><br/>I'm assuming the use of the Pico C SDK. I'm also assuming that the build is controlled using CMake and CMakeLists.txt,  as there isn't any documented alternative. Sadly.</blockquote>

<h2>Connection, and its implications</h2>
<p>
To connect a USB keyboard you'll need some kind of adapter, as keyboards
are usually designed to plug into a type-A socket. The Pico has
a micro-USB socket, and no type-A. 
</p>
<p>
Both powered and unpowered adapters are available. There are often 
described as "OTG cables" or "OTG adapters", The powered version may be
called a "USB Y adapter", but names vary. These devices are very cheap from 
on-line retailers.  
</p>
<p>
A powered adapter will have a place to plug in an ordinary USB cable, which
is connected to a 5V supply (or a computer's USB socket). If you're using
an unpowered adapter, you'll need to find some other way to power the
Pico board -- typically by connecting a 5V supply the Vsys pin. 
</p>
<p>
As the Pico has only one USB port, using it for a keyboard prevents it
being used to connect to a computer for diagnostic purposes. We can't 
connect the USB port to a host computer and use a terminal emulator, 
for example. 
</p>
<p>
One way around this problem is to use the Pico's non-USB UART as
the diagnostic port. To do this you'll need a 5V serial-to-USB converter,
or to connect the UART to some other device that works with 5V serial
data (e.g., a full-sized raspberry Pi). 
</p>
<p>
A simple approach to getting diagnostic data is to send it to an
LCD display attached to the Pico. This is particularly appropriate if
your application calls for a display anyway. My sample application
uses an I2C LCD display, and some code that makes it respond like a 
terminal. It's easy to write USB event data to a display like this, 
particularly if you provide it will some way to scroll back to see
earlier output. 
</p>
<p>
The photo below shows my test set-up: the Pico is connected to a 
keyboard and a power supply using a powered OTG (Y) cable, and to
an LCD display using the four-wire I2C interface. The source code
describes how to connect the LCD display, should you wish to try it.

<h2>Basic SDK set-up</h2>
<p>
All that is necessary in the build set-up is to include the
relevant TinyUSB libraries in <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
target_link_libraries (${BINARY} PRIVATE ... tinyusb_host tinyusb_board)
</pre>

<p>
If you also try to use:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
pico_enable_stdio_usb (...)
</pre>

<p>
You'll get a warning message, because the single USB port can't be
used in host and device mode at the same time.
</p>

<h2>Main loop and scanning for USB events</h2>
<p>
The main part of a program that uses a USB keyboard (or, in fact,
any USB device) will look something like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#000080">#include</font></b> <font color="#FF0000">"bsp/board.h"</font>
<b><font color="#000080">#include</font></b> <font color="#FF0000">"tusb.h"</font>

  <b><font color="#000000">board_init</font></b><font color="#990000">();</font>
  <b><font color="#000000">tusb_init</font></b><font color="#990000">();</font>

  <i><font color="#9A1900">// Program's main loop</font></i>
  <b><font color="#0000FF">while</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#993399">1</font><font color="#990000">)</font> 
    <font color="#FF0000">{</font>
    <b><font color="#000000">tuh_task</font></b><font color="#990000">();</font>
    <i><font color="#9A1900">// Do other stuff</font></i>
    <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
</pre>

<p>
<code>board_init()</code> and <code>tusb_init()</code> are both part of the
TinyUSB initialization process -- more on this later.
</p>
<p>
Calling <code>tuh_task()</code> dispatches events from the USB
input buffers to various callback routines (of which, more later). 
This function needs to be
called at intervals that are short compared with the frequency of 
USB events -- in this case, it must be called far more quickly than
keystrokes on the USB keyboard. It doesn't hurt to call it
much more frequently than that. However, this requirements does mean
that anything else that is triggered by the program's main loop
<i>must</i> be short-lived.  
</p>
<p>
</p>

<h2>TinyUSB configuration</h2>

<p>
<code>bsp/board.h</code> and <code>tusb.h</code> are both part of the
TinyUSB library. The latter includes, indirectly, this directive:
form:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#000080">#include</font></b> <font color="#FF0000">"tusb_config.h"</font>
</pre>

<p>
The settings in <code>tusb_config.h</code>, which the application must
provide, configure various parts of the TinyUSB library, including
which features to initialize. Because of the way <code>tusb_config.h</code>
is included, the application's build system must ensure that it can
be found somewhere in the application source. In my example program
I have this file in the directory <code>usb_kbd/include</code>, and
I have added this to <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
target_include_directories (${BINARY} PUBLIC kbd/include)
</pre>

<p>
There is little guidance in the Pico SDK about what <code>tusb_config.h</code>
should contain. I have found (mostly by trial-and-error) 
that the following minimal set-up works for a USB keyboard. It disables
everything except hub and HID support.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><b><font color="#000080">#define</font></b> <font color="#008080">CFG_TUSB_RHPORT0_MODE</font>       OPT_MODE_HOST
<b><font color="#000080">#define</font></b> CFG_TUH_HUB                 <font color="#993399">1</font>

<b><font color="#000080">#define</font></b> CFG_TUH_VENDOR              <font color="#993399">0</font>
<b><font color="#000080">#define</font></b> <b><font color="#000000">CFG_TUSB_HOST_DEVICE_MAX</font></b>    <font color="#990000">(</font>CFG_TUH_HUB <font color="#990000">?</font> <font color="#993399">5</font> <font color="#990000">:</font> <font color="#993399">1</font><font color="#990000">)</font> 
</pre>

<h2>TinyUSB callbacks</h2>
<p>
The function <code>tuh_task()</code> dispatches to callback functions
when USB events are received. The only specific callbacks we need to
implement for USB keyboard support are 
<code>tuh_hid_mount_cb()</code> and <code>tuh_hid_report_received_cb</code>.  
</p>
<p>
<code>tuh_hid_mount_cb()</code> is called whenever a new devices is detected.
This might be because the Pico startup up with the device in place, or
because it has been plugged in at runtime. In either case, all we need to
do is to ask the device to send its "report". The device will do so
in due-course -- we can't wait for it, so another callback is needed 
for this. A report is the term that the USB specific uses for a packet
of data that can be requested by the host from a device; of course, the
content of the report will be different for different kinds of device.
</p>
<p>
<code>tuh_hid_mount_cb()</code> itself is very simple:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#008080">oid</font> <b><font color="#000000">tuh_hid_mount_cb</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#008080">uint8_t</font> dev_addr<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#008080">uint8_t</font> instance<font color="#990000">,</font>

  <font color="#FF0000">{</font>
  <i><font color="#9A1900">/* Ask for a report only if this is a keyboard device */</font></i>

  <b><font color="#0000FF">if</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>itf_protocol <font color="#990000">==</font> HID_ITF_PROTOCOL_KEYBOARD<font color="#990000">)</font>
    <font color="#FF0000">{</font>
    <b><font color="#000000">tuh_hid_receive_report</font></b> <font color="#990000">(</font>dev_addr<font color="#990000">,</font> instance<font color="#990000">);</font>
    <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
  <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
</pre>

<p>
<code>tuh_hid_report_received_cb</code> has the following outline:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#008080">oid</font> <b><font color="#000000">tuh_hid_report_received_cb</font></b>  <font color="#990000">(</font><font color="#008080">uint8_t</font> dev_addr<font color="#990000">,</font> <font color="#008080">uint8_t</font> instance<font color="#990000">,</font>

    <font color="#FF0000">{</font>
    <b><font color="#0000FF">case</font></b> HID_ITF_PROTOCOL_KEYBOARD<font color="#990000">:</font>
      <b><font color="#000000">process_kbd_report</font></b> <font color="#990000">((</font><font color="#008080">hid_keyboard_report_t</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">const</font></b><font color="#990000">*)</font> report<font color="#990000">);</font>

      <b><font color="#0000FF">break</font></b><font color="#990000">;</font>
    <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
  <font color="#FF0000">}</font>
</pre>

<p>
In this function we check that the report is from a keyboard -- which it
must be, since we haven't requested a report from anything else --
process the report, and then ask for the next report. Note that the
requesting of reports is an ongoing process -- the device doesn't just
continue to send a stream of data once it has begun. 
</p>

<h2>Processing the keyboard report</h2>
<p>
I'm not going to explain this in detail (but see the sample source code)
because it's just basic C programming. The report will contain the
scan codes (not character codes) of up to six keystrokes. Why six? This
is the number of keys that may be depressed <i>simultaneously</i>. 
It's very common, when typing quickly, to press a key when the previous
one has not been released. I can't imagine typing quickly enough to
hold down six keys, but the USB HID specification allows for this.
</p>

<p>
So the report will contain up to six scan codes -- unused slots will
have a scan code of zero. There is a complication, however: if
I prss key X and hold it, this generates a report. If I then press
key Y, this generates another report, but <i>key X is still included</i>
because it is still down. This means that the application's keyboard
handler will have to check, in each incoming report, whether each
scan code is a duplicate. This is a little fiddly, but not rocket
science.
</p>

<h2>Mapping scan codes to characters</h2>
<p>
The scan code generated by the USB keyboard is arbitrary, with different
layouts using different codes. A US keyboard, for example, will have
A=5, B=6... A UK keyboard will be similar, but not identical. 
If we're writing a program for the Pico from the ground up, that won't
share code with anything else, we can use the scan codes directly.
In practice, it's usually easier to turn the scan codes into something
more universal, such as ASCII characters. 
</p>
<p>
This process is a little more fiddly than it might first appear: there
is no simple, programmatic way of knowing what effect the "shift" key
will have. Usually the shift key will turn lower case into upper case
characters, but its effect on symbol keys is unsystematic. We need, therefore,
at least two translations tables -- one for non-shifted keys and one for
shifted keys. There will be a lot of overlap between these tables, but
the relationship isn't predictable. The "ctrl" key, however, has a 
predictable effect -- it sets bits 4 and 5 of the ASCII code to zero.
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>
So that's all there is to using a USB keyboard: about 200 lines of
C code, of which 150 are the definition of the scan code translation table.
It's worth pointing out that USB host support has been a little flaky
in the Pico C SDK in the past. I am using version 1.4.0, and I 
understand that there are still some USB keyboards (all wireless ones)
that don't yet work. 
</p>
<p>
The USB host example provided with the Pico C SDK arranges to flash the
on-board LED at regular intervals. This is a sound thing to do, to ensure
that the Pico is still running, and hasn't halted. I've found that
programming errors in the USB host area do have a tendency to cause
a board halt.
