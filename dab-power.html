<h1>Why the energy cost or benefit of switching to DAB digital radio is hard to assess</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/battery.png" 
  alt="battery"/>
One of the things that the current, terrible situation in Ukraine has 
taught us -- if we didn't already know -- is that we use a lot of
energy. It often feels as if manufacturers and promoters of 
electronic devices think they're living in a world with an unlimited
energy supply. In reality, UK domestic fuel consumption has decreased
over the last few years, but there's still a long way to go.
</p>
<p>
The UK shut down its analogue television stations some time ago and,
frankly, they aren't missed. The prospective shut-down of
analogue radio, however, has raised concerns, one of which is whether
digital (DAB) radio will use more energy overall. This wasn't really 
a concern with television -- most of the energy used by a television
goes into the display; it doesn't make a huge different whether it uses
analogue or digital broadcast technology. The same is not true for
radio receivers -- not, at least, for the conventional "tabletop"
receivers that are found in almost every household in the UK.
</p>
<p>
It's astounding -- at least, it astounds me -- that BBC radio services
account for fully 1% of the total UK energy consumption. It's still
a small amount, when compared to heating the spaces we live and work
in, but it still seems an awful lot of energy. I guess it just shows
how much power it takes to fill the air with radio waves. 
</p>
<p>
With this in mind, it's not surprising that there is concern about the power
consumption of DAB digital radio. DAB is a popular technology -- a tabletop
DAB radio is as easy to use as an analogue one but, in most regions,
offers a larger range of stations, and is largely immune to electrical
interference and atmospheric effects. The BBC says that about 60% of
all radio listening is done with digital devices of some sort.
</p>
<p>
There's no doubt that a tabletop DAB receiver uses more energy than
an analogue FM receiver with similar features. The same is true of
portable devices. My pocket radio has a battery life of about 50 hours
when playing FM, but only six hours for DAB. I do not know if the
same sort of findings affect tabletop, mains-powered radios. I think they
do, but probably not to the same extent. A widely-quoted figure is
8 Watts (W) for a DAB radio, 2W for an analogue radio. It's worth bearing in 
mind that these figures apply only to small radios -- if you're listening
to radio broadcasts on a full-sized hi-fi system, at ear-splitting
volumes, the overall power consumption is not going to depend significantly
on the broadcast technology: all the energy will go into making noise. 
</p>
<p>
I suspect that younger people might be surprised at just how prevalent
tabletop radios are. Many of my parents' generation -- those who are
still with us -- have a radio on all day. I listen to the Radio 4 news
for half an hour in the morning, and that's about all. My kids, in their
twenties, don't know what a radio is. Be that as it may,
according to <a href="https://radiotoday.co.uk/2022/02/uk-radio-listening-remains-static-at-89-of-the-population/" target="_blank">Radio Today</a>,
50 million people in the UK listen to radio broadcasts, averaging about
20 hours per week. I'd guess that much of that radio listening is on
equipment that will show very different energy consumption between 
analogue and digital technology. 
</p>
<p>
Based on these figures, it's not hard to see why the switch-off
of analogue radio, originally planned for 2015, has been postponed until
at least 2032. If a digital radio really does consume 8W for every 2W
of an analogue radio, and radio already uses 1% of the UK's entire energy
supply, that would be catastrophic. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The situation is, of course, not that simple. 
</p>
<p>
According to research carried out by the BBC in 2020, the <i>transmission</i>
of broadcast radio accounts for nearly 80% of the total energy budget. 
The energy demands of receivers are not really significant. So when we
talk about the energy usage of radio, we really have to be clear
about whether we're talking about the <i>personal</i> or the <i>national</i>
impact of any planned change. There's no doubt that, at the personal level,
DAB radios are more expensive to buy and run that analogue ones. 
At the national level, though, we need to be more concerned about the 
energy required for transmission. 
</p>
<p>
So does it use more, or less, energy to transmit DAB? This is where things
start to get messy.
</p>
<p>
An FM transmitter consumes essentially the same amount of energy whatever
it is transmitting. The carrier wave is always present, even if what's being
carried is silent. If the radio program is human speech, probably 10%-50%
of the time what's being transmitted is silence. It goes without saying
that running a transmitter at full power to broadcast nothing is
wasteful.
</p>
<p>
A DAB transmitter behaves in much the same way -- the power consumption
will still be high if there is nothing being broadcast but silence.
However, DAB stations are <i>multiplexed</i>, that is, many different
stations will use the same tramsmitter. The multiplexing means that,
although a DAB transmitter is just as wasteful as an FM transmitter
when it's broadcasting silence, it's never broadcasting silence. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, broadcasting silence is an extreme example. A music broadcast
will contain very little silence. So does the use of multiplexing
reduce the power demand with music as well?
</p>
<p>
This is where things get <i>really</i> messy.
</p>
<p>
The use of multiplexing means that the available transmission bandwidth
(capacity) of the transmitter is shared between different radio sources.
Part of the multiplexing process involves data compression -- using
mathematical tricks to reduce the bandwidth required by a particular signal.
DAB radio compression is <i>lossy</i>, in the same sense that, for example,
MP3 audio files are (and the soundtracks of DVD movies). The compression
process loses some detail, which can never be regained. The cleverness
of the compression scheme -- and it is undeniably clever -- is that it
attempts to lose only information that cannot actually be perceived.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the more lossy the compression, the more likely it is that the
signal will be degraded to an audible extent. 
</p>
<p>
Now, the amount of loss in the compression depends on the number of
stations that are sharing the same transmitter, and the content of
each station's broadcast. In the UK, a few (very few) stations are
protected from having their signals over-compressed. BBC Radio
3 is one example. All other
stations have seen the lossiness of their compression increaed over
the years, to accomodate more stations in the same amount of
transmitter bandwidth. It's no longer true, if it ever was, that
DAB radio offers CD-quality sound. Many stations don't even
achieve FM-quality. 
</p>
<p>
The effect of multiplexing, combined with lossy data compression, means
that DAB radio makes much more effective use of the transmitter
power than FM radio does. All this means that, at current levels of
technology, the total, national energy consumption associated with
radio will probably reduce when FM radio is switched off.
</p>
<p>
The reason that assertions like this are so hotly contested, particularly
by radio enthusiasts, is that comparison is not like-with-like. 
The improved energy consumption is achieved at the expense of
greater levels of multiplexing, with a consequent loss of audio quality.
It could be argued that we should be comparing energy consumption 
of DAB radio when used with the same number of stations, at the same
quality, as FM radio. However, DAB technology simply doesn't work 
that way -- this isn't a comparison that can actually be made.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
So where does that leave us? With the best figures we have today, and
assuming the same operating conditions, it would appear that having everybody
move from FM to DAB radio would save a modest amount of energy
-- at the national level. At least, 
that's what <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2020-10-sustainability-radio-audio-energy-streaming-broadcast" target="_blank">the BBC tells us</a>.
Each individual would still experience greater energy costs but,
as noted above, the receivers only play a small part, when it comes to
energy efficiency.
</p>
<p>
But this gain in energy efficiency comes at the cost of a reduced
sound quality. The scale of that reduction is extremely difficult to 
assess, depending as it does on how stations are routed to multiplexes, and what
kind of content is being broadcast. 
</p>
<p>
Another way to reduce the energy requirements of digital radio would be
to allow fewer stations, or reduce power (which would leave some
households out of range), or broadcast only part of the time. Nobody is
proposing any of <i>these</i> approaches as ways to reduce 
the energy needs of radio. Reducing quality, however, is seem by many
as an acceptable cost, if the benefit is improved energy efficiency. 
</p>
<p>
All of this means that assessing the costs and benefits, in energy terms,
of switching to digital radio is not merely a technological problem
-- it's also an aesthetic and social one. This is why it's so difficult.
