<h1 id="some-thoughts-on-de-googling-google-pixel-phones">Some thoughts
on de-Googling Google Pixel phones</h1>
<p><img src="img/degoogle.png" class="article-top-image" /></p>
<p>In this article I outline my experiences running LineageOS, /e/OS,
and GrapheneOS on a refurbished Google Pixel 7 (but I have no reason to
expect radically different behaviour from any of the Pixel range). I’ve
compared these custom ROMs in <a
href="lineage-eos-graphene.html">another article</a>, and I don’t want
to repeat those observations here; this article is more about the
handset.</p>
<p>TL;DR – all the custom firmwares worked almost flawlessly without
much need for tinkering – bearing in mind my modest requirements.</p>
<h2 id="why-google-pixel">Why Google Pixel?</h2>
<p>It’s ironic that the Google Pixel phones are so popular for
de-Googling, but it’s no accident: these are great handsets on which to
install a custom ROM.</p>
<p>First, most of the popular custom ROMs support some or all of the
Pixel range. Lineage and /e/OS offer the widest range of support: all
devices from the earliest Pixel 1 (2016) to the Pixel 9 remain fully
supported, providing Android 15 or 16. Graphene doesn’t support models
earlier than the Pixel 6, but it does have some experimental support for
the new Pixel 10 (which I haven’t tried, as I can’t afford one). Calyx
also supports Pixels 6-9, although Calyx is currently unavailable,
because of internal restructuring in the project. Most custom ROMs
support the ‘-a’, ‘Pro’, and ‘fold’ variants of the Pixel, as well as
the more mainstream offerings.</p>
<p>Second, custom ROMS can support voice-over-LTE (voLTE) in Pixel
handsets. Samsung handsets, although previously popular for de-Googling,
<a href="samsung-no-more-lineage.html">are no longer viable</a> because
of the lack of an open-source VoLTE implementation. In many regions,
including mine, there’s no longer any carrier of voice calls except
VoLTE. Given the comparative scarcity of Motorola and LG handsets in the
UK, the only real alternatives to Google Pixel devices are now those
from Sony – and Sony’s handsets are comparatively expensive.</p>
<p>Third, it’s unusual to find a Pixel handset that can’t have its
bootloader unlocked. This process is a prerequisite to installing
<em>any</em> alternative firmware, so it’s irritating that some handsets
are not unlockable, often for obscure reasons. Since you’ll likely not
find out whether the bootloader can be unlocked until you’ve bought the
handset, it’s reassuring to know that the Pixels are likely to work.</p>
<p>Fourth, I understand that the Pixels (at least the recent ones) have
specific security hardware which is relevant to tamper detection. I
can’t claim to understand how this works, but it’s something that some
custom firmware will use.</p>
<p>Fifth, the Pixels offer impressive hardware features for their price,
particularly if you’re willing to buy a refurbished unit.</p>
<p>Taking all these factors into account, it isn’t surprising that so
many privacy-conscious Android users turn to Google for their handsets,
despite that company’s terrible reputation for slurping up personal
data.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-google-pixel">Why not Google Pixel?</h2>
<p>None of the recent models in the Pixel range has a headphone jack or
an SD card slot. If you’re de-Googling, you’re probably trying to get
away from storing data in Google’s cloud, and the lack of SD storage
might be a problem. The de-Googled Pixels do work with USB-C memory
sticks (I tried), but these dongles are ungainly, and interfere with
charging.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>I was able to install Lineage, Graphene, and /e/OS easily on the
Pixel – more easily than on Samsung handsets, anyway. The procedures for
each handset are different, but all are well-documented. You’ll need the
<code>fastboot</code> and <code>adb</code> tools, or you could try the
web-based installer for Graphene.</p>
<p>All the documented installation procedures are designed to be applied
to the vendor’s stock Android, not to a different custom ROM. That’s
only an issue if you’re going from one custom firmware to another, as I
am for these tests. While it’s probably possible to go directly from,
say, Graphene to Lineage if you have the expertise, I encountered some
weird misbehaviour when I tried this, which reverting to the stock
firmware as an intermediate step fixed.</p>
<p>Although none of the installations took more than about half an hour,
you still have all the post-installation set-up to do, which can take a
lot longer. Because I do this kind of thing so often, I now have scripts
that do all the set-up that I need.</p>
<p>Both Lineage and /e/OS are easy to root on the Pixel 7, <a
href="root-2025.html">if you need this</a>, both following the same
procedure using Magisk. So far as I know, this hacky method of rooting
doesn’t work on Graphene, and you’d probably need to build it from
source with the additional root components in place. Trying this is on
my to-do-list but, so far, it hasn’t even reached the top half.</p>
<p>If you don’t want the hassle of installing a custom ROM yourself, you
can buy a Pixel with /e/OS pre-installed from Murena. When I last
looked, Murena was offering a refurbished Pixel 7 with /e/OS for €414.
It’s hard to compare this price with the cost of buying the handset and
doing your own installation, because the exact degree of refurbishment
is unclear, whatever the supplier. Moreover, the prices of this sort of
thing vary almost on an hourly basis. When I checked last, I could get a
Pixel 7 in what was described as ‘excellent’ condition from BackMarket
for £250 (about €285). If you’ve never de-Googled a phone yourself, €129
to save yourself a couple of days of frustration might be money well
spent.</p>
<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>
<p>I have to point out that I don’t use any Google services, nor any
apps that can only be installed from the Google Play Store, or that
require Google services internally. Each of Lineage, /e/OS/, and
Graphene have their own ways of attempting to provide or simulate Google
services in a privacy-sparing way. If you need banking and payment apps,
there probably are differences between these platforms that you might
need to investigate. Since I use primarily open-source apps, these
things don’t bother me, and all the custom ROMs I tried behaved
similarly, with all the apps I use.</p>
<p>I found one oddity with Graphene (which I’ve seen elsewhere): I
couldn’t get the playback control buttons to work on a USB-C headset, or
on a headphone dongle. Audio itself worked fine. Graphene has security
restrictions around the USB-C port that the other platforms don’t have
but, even with these relaxed as far as possible, I never could get the
buttons to work. It’s a small thing, but annoying.</p>
<p>I found the LineageOS camera app to be a little unreliable on the
Pixel 7: sometimes it would start up with a blank screen, and
occasionally it crashed. I didn’t see this behaviour with the stock
Google camera, or with the camera supplied with Graphene. I’ve not had a
problem with the Lineage camera on Samsung handsets, so I’m guessing
this is a quirk of the Pixel/Lineage combination.</p>
<p>I didn’t notice any significant difference in general performance
between any of the custom ROMs and the stock Google firmware but, to be
fair, I didn’t run benchmarks. With both stock and custom firmware, my
Pixel 7 gets about two days’ battery life with my modest usage.</p>
<p>All the usual telephony features worked fine with all the custom
ROMs. In particular, I was able to use VoLTE for calls, and this needed
no particular fiddling.</p>
<p>Given that installing any custom ROM on a Google Pixel doesn’t take
more than an hour (once you know how to do it), installing one is almost
a no-brainer if you care about privacy.</p>
<h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h2>
<p>All the custom firmwares I tried were easy to install on the Pixel 7,
and I wouldn’t expect the process to be any more difficult with any
other Pixel. All worked well enough for my purposes but, if your needs
are more stringent than mine, you’ll need to think about which specific
custom ROM you want, that will best balance privacy and convenience.</p>
<p>Although I’ve been using the Pixel 7 for about a month, I find its
lack of a headphone jack and memory expansion slot deeply irritating.
Most likely I won’t continue with it much longer, if I can find a
reasonably-affordable alternative that does have the features that Pixel
lacks.</p>
