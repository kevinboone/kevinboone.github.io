<h1>The vexed problem of generating delays in a CP/M program</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/terminal.png" 
  alt="terminal prompt"/>
Generating reasonably accurate delays has always been a 
problem in CP/M programming. Most CP/M machines have no system clock
of any kind and, even if one is present, CP/M itself has no standard
API for using it. Consequently, the generation of timing delays falls to
the programmer.
</p>
<p>
I'm assuming the use of a Z80 CPU here, although the basic logic
remains the same for 8080. I will break the problem down into 
two parts: delays of the order of microseconds, and delays of the
order of milliseconds.
</p>

<h2>Delays of the order of microseconds</h2> 
<p>
To get delays this short, the standard technique is simply to execute
some instructions that do nothing much, but just waste time. The
instructions should not change the program state in any way that
cannot easily be corrected.
To work out how much time each instruction takes, we'll need to know 
the number of
<i>T states</i> each instruction requires, and the clock speed.
A 'T state' is, essentially, Z80 jargon for a clock period. With a 
4MHz CPU, each T state is 1/4E6 = 250 ns long. 
The <code>nop</code> (do nothing) instruction is 4 T states long,
so executing it will create a delay of 1 microsecond (at 4HMz).
</p>
<p>
Achieving delays of tens of microseconds can be accomplished simply
by finding combinations of instructions that have no overall effect,
and whose T states add up to the required value. For example, 
I can get a 30 microsecond delay (at 4MHz) like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><font color="#990000">------------------------------------------------------------------------</font>
<i><font color="#9A1900">;  Delay 30 usec (on 4MHz Z80 hardware)</font></i>
<i><font color="#9A1900">;------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></i>
        <b><font color="#0000FF">PUSH</font></b> HL
  	LD H<font color="#990000">,</font>L
	LD L<font color="#990000">,</font>H
        <b><font color="#0000FF">POP</font></b> HL
        <b><font color="#0000FF">PUSH</font></b> HL
  	LD H<font color="#990000">,</font>L
	LD L<font color="#990000">,</font>H
        <b><font color="#0000FF">POP</font></b> HL
        <b><font color="#0000FF">PUSH</font></b> HL
  	LD H<font color="#990000">,</font>L
	LD L<font color="#990000">,</font>H
        <b><font color="#0000FF">POP</font></b> HL
        <b><font color="#0000FF">PUSH</font></b> HL
  	LD H<font color="#990000">,</font>L
	LD L<font color="#990000">,</font>H
        <b><font color="#0000FF">POP</font></b> HL
	<b><font color="#0000FF">NOP</font></b>
</pre>

<p>
This works because the <code>PUSH</code> and <code>POP</code>
instructions reverse one another, and any other changes to the H
or L registers between these instructions are corrected by
the <code>POP</code>. The T states just happen to add up to
120, which takes 30 microseconds at 4MHz. 
</p>
<p>
It can take considerable ingenuity to find instructions that don't
change the state of the program, and happen to give the correct
T state count. You'll need a Z80 datasheet to find the T states
for each instruction. I should point out that if you want a 
<i>subroutine</i> that delays 30 microseconds, or any other short
time, you'll need to account for the number of T states involved
in making the subroutine call itself.  
</p>

<h2>Delays of the order of milliseconds</h2> 
<p>
Once the required delay gets longer than about 100 microseconds, 
chaining do-nothing operations together becomes unwieldy, and we
need to resort to a loop of some kind. A trivial loop, where we
just decrement a 16-bit register until it gets to zero, will give
us a delay of up to about 350 msec (at 4MHz). To get longer
delays than this, we can nest loops inside one another, or
just pad out the loop with other, do-nothing instructions.
Neither the Z80 or 8080 CPUs had any power management, so it did no
harm to run long-duration do-nothing loops. This wouldn't be safe
on a modern computer, unless you were certain of the state of its
fans and heatsinks. 
</p>
<p>
Here is a subroutine that will give a delay of 100 msec, give or
take a few microseconds, on the Z80 Playground board, clocked
at 10 MHz. Because the number of iterations of the loops is large,
I don't need to worry about the overheads of making the function 
call -- they won't amount to even 1 millisecond. Of course, if I
wanted a delay of <i>exactly</i> 100.00000 milliseconds, I would need
to account for these additional instructions.
</p>

<h2>The complications of conditional instructions</h2> 
<p>
I won't go into details here, but it's worth keeping in mind that the
number of T states taken by a conditional (branch, jump) instruction
varies, according to whether the condition is met or not. If you're
using a loop to create delays then, so long as the number of iterations
is large, or the contents of the loop are time-consuming, this creates
no significant inaccuracies. However, if you need very precise timing,
this awkward timing behaviour does need to be taken into account.
</p>

<h2>Handling variations in clock speed</h2> 
<p>
This brings us to the part that nobody wants to think about. While 4MHz
was a common clock speed for Z80 CP/M systems, it was not universal. 
The Z80 Playground can be clocked at 10MHz (although it has a 4MHz
compatibility mode), and some systems that required low power 
consumption were underclocked significantly.
</p>
<p>
There is simply no nice way of dealing with this, other than accepting
that you'll have to either (a) ignore it and hope for the best, 
or (b) provide different 
versions of the program for
different hardware, or (c) provide a way for the user to calibrate the
program at installation time.
</p>
<p>
(b) can be a real nuisance but, in <i>most</i> cases, errors in timing aren't
hugely important. So some combination of (b) and (a) (do your best, and hope for it works out)
might suffice. If your program requires the user press a key within
five seconds, it probably doesn't matter hugely if it turns out to allow
seven seconds. It often doesn't even matter that much when interfacing
external devices. Many devices have a 'settling time' after power-on,
during which they can't accept instructions.
Settling times are usually of the order of tens of milliseconds and, if
your program waits fifty milliseconds rather than the thirty specified in
the datasheet, that's probably not the end of the world. Even the actual
interfacing protocol <i>usually</i> doesn't require that much timing
precision. Most devices don't mind behind clocked a little slower than
they might accept, so setting timings for the fastest Z80 you need to 
support might be sufficient.  
</p>
<p>
But if you do require precision timing, and you have to support 
different CP/M machines, then user calibration is the only way forward.
The usual way to do this is to ask the user to press a key at certain
intervals -- perhaps ten seconds. We can time the number of iterations
of a loop that are executed in that time. It's not as easy as it sounds,
because we'll need to check for keyboard input, and we can't guarantee
that will take a particular number of T states on different hardware.
And the only way to work out the number of T states it takes on 
<i>any</i> hardware is to time a larger number of repetitions using
a clock.
</p>
<p>
This is all very vexing, and it's no surprise that the provision of some
kind of clock became mandatory after the demise of CP/M.
