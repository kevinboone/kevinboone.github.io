<h1>Yet another desktop Raspberry Pi media player</h1>

<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/pi.png" 
  alt="Pi logo"/>
</p>
<p>
I'm not hugely interested in streaming audio from a subscription service.
I'm aware that this is the way that most people consume media these days,
but it doesn't suit me all that well. I subscribe to Spotify, and I have
subscribed to Qobuz and others over the years. I just prefer to 'own'
my music. OK, I have a law degree, so I'm perfectly well aware of how
little I actually own when 
I buy, say, an audio CD. But this isn't a legal matter --
I just like my recorded music to be under my control. I spend a 
lot of time in remote areas where there is no Internet access. I have 
a bunch of portable audio players, not to mention a smartphone, and I
like to be able to copy a stack of albums onto those devices and take
them into the hills.
</p>
<p>
I'm also fussy about sound quality. I have to compromise
a bit with portable devices (not much, in fact, with Astell and Kern)
but I don't see why I shouldn't have the best in my office and living room.
</p>
<p>
In practice, though, it's hard to buy a local (not network) media player
in the form of a desktop device. There are some nice network
media players, like the
<a href="https://www.richersounds.com/cambridge-audio-cxn-v2-lunar-grey.html" target="_blank">Cambridge Audio CXN V2</a> that will play from a UPnP 
audio server. So I guess I could set up a Raspberry Pi with a big 
USB memory stick and run a UPnP server on it. There are two problems
with this approach, however. First, equipment like this is shockingly
expensive. Second, the use of UPnP limits the user interface in ways that
are unacceptable when you have thousands of albums.
</p>
<p>
The Brennan CD jukebox units have similar problems -- they offer a 
nice, all-in-one solution for people who want to rip CDs and access the rips
using a menu. But the user interface is, again, not convenient, and
it's somewhat awkward to back up the ripped data in a central place.
</p>
<p>
The project I'm describing here is something I've been working on,
on and off, for a long time. It's a desktop/hifi audio player that
primarily works with local files (perhaps stored on a server, but perhaps
just on a USB stick) and has a full, web-based user interface, as well
as front-panel screen and controls. It's based on a Raspberry Pi 3B+,
although I suspect that other single-board Linux systems would work.
One of the main design goals is that each unit is sufficiently cheap that
I can envisage having one in every room in my house. I have a target of
UK&pound;150, although I have to admit that I have to buy some parts second-hand
to keep the price down. The good thing, though, is that the parts are
so commonplace that they are widely available used on eBay and similar. 
</p>

<h2>Design goals</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Plays local media from a USB stick, or from an NFS server</p></li>
<li><p>Plays Internet radio streams -- BBC essential, others desirable</p></li>
<li><p>Offers 'real hifi' sound quality, with uncompressed FLAC at 96kHz/24bit</p></li>
<li><p>Has a built in screen and local controls</p></li>
<li><p>Supports an IR remote control</p></li>
<li><p>Has a full web interface, with searching, filtering, and cover art</p></li>
<li><p>Instant on, instant off</p></li>
<li><p>Costs less than UK&pound;150</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
To the best of my knowledge, no such device is available to purchase 
-- and I've looked hard. Hifi media players with built-in hard disk
did exist at some point, but they seem quietly to have disappeared.
I am not sure why -- perhaps most people prefer the convenience
of streaming over sound quality, and never go anywhere that has no 
Internet access. 
</p>

<h3>Raspberry Pi and audio quality</h3>
<p>
The Pi 3 is a great choice for this sort of device -- its power consumption
is negligible (by hifi standards), it doesn't need cooling, and it runs
a full Linux. It's possible to use a Pi 4, but it offers no advantages
(beyond greater availability), and needs substantial heatsinking if
you don't want your music overlaid with fan whine. I strongly suspect that
there are other single-board computers that are at least as effective,
but the Pi is what I'm familiar with. 
</p>
<p>
You can buy proprietary audio add-ons for the Pi range, and they seem to
offer decent sound quality. However, there are plenty of self-contained
audio DACs that I <i>know</i> offer decent quality. Moreover, USB audio
is a standard, so no unusual software is needed on the Pi -- this is a
consideration when you're building the Linux installation from the ground
up (more on this later).
</p>
<p>
For my latest prototype I'm using the
<a href="https://www.whathifi.com/cambridge-audio/dacmagic-xs/review" target="_blank">Cambridge DacMagic XS</a> as the audio output device. This is a 
tiny dongle, so it fits neatly into the enclosure. In other prototypes
I've taken larger 'USB soundcard' devices and stripped them down to a bare
board. This works well also, but the XS has the advantage of low power
consumption (even though it runs warm). Power consumption can be a problem
here (see below), so component selection is important.
</p>
<p>
The DACMagic XS is not the best-sounding USB DAC I've heard, but it blows
away anything else for the price. Sadly, it's hard to obtain these days.
</p>
<p>
Of course, you can spend as much as you like on a USB DAC, and it doesn't
necessarily have to fit inside the case of the media player. Moreover,
many good-quality hifi amplifiers now have USB inputs, so you might just
need a USB cable.
</p>

<h3>Raspberry Pi instant on, instant off</h3>
<p>
No mainstream Raspberry Pi distribution is suitable for this application.
All these Linux versions are designed for a graphical desktop, and have
lengthy start-up and shut-down procedures. If you don't follow the shutdown
procedure properly, you risk corrupting the storage.
</p>
<p>
I suppose it would be possible to fit a 'shut down' button somewhere, that
invoked a clean shutdown procedure. But the Pi devices have no power
management -- you can't actually shut off power in software. My shutdown
procedure is to switch the electricity off -- anything more than that is
a show-stopper.
</p>
<p>
And, frankly, I'm not willing to wait more than a few seconds for the
unit to become ready when it's switched on. Desktop Pi Linux often takes
a minute to boot. That's simply no use for an application like this --
I'm looking for a boot time of two seconds. That I can't quite meet
that target is the fault of the display device, as I'll describe below.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, with a <a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/rasp-pi-min-console-build">completely custom, read-only Linux</a> I can get acceptable start-up
times and, being read-only, shutting down is not a problem.
</p>
<p>
Full disclosure: it's not completely read-only. The media software can
scan metadata (tags) in audio files and build a searchable database. This
needs to be writeable, but nothing else does.
</p>
<p>
The custom Linux distribution dispenses with PulseAudio and expects
applications to work directly with ALSA. I've never seen the 
point of Pulse, and it certainly isn't needed here. Dispensing with it
allows for finer control of how the audio is processed -- there are fewer
opportunities for accidental downsampling and that kind of thing. I'm 
sure it's possible to avoid unwanted audio processing with Pulse, but I
don't know how to be <i>certain</i> of it. Even ALSA is not faultless
in this regard, but it's more transparent.
</p>

<h3>Audio player software</h3>
<p>
There's no shortage of audio player applications for Linux. The
problem is that they are designed either for a full desktop interface, 
or a simple command line. Since my player has neither a desktop, nor
a keyboard for entering commands, none of these players are useful.
</p>
<p>
Both the Xine and VLC players, however, have a reliable and well-documented
programming interface. It's relatively straightforward to write software
that embeds these players, and provides whatever interface is desired.
For a long time I focused on Xine but, sadly, it appears no longer to be
maintained. VLC is more modern, and is still under active development.
</p>
<p>
The key part of my audio software is an HTTP server that embeds VLC.
This makes all the necessary features of VLC available to other
software, by accepting simple
HTTP requests on a REST API. This software also manges the 
audio database, by scanning
the audio files, constructing the database, and responding to database 
queries.
</p>
<p>
Communicating with this key server are a variety of user interfaces.
An HTTP server provides the web browser interface, while a console application
based on <code>ncurses</code> provides a simple local interface. There's
also a command-line interface, should it be necessary.
</p>
<p>
The Web interface, in fact, is where I have had to concentrate most of
my development effort. This interface provides a way to browse by
tags (album, composer...) or by date of addition, with or without 
cover art. The interface does use JavaScript and CSS, so it requires a fairly
modern browser. However, I've taken some trouble to make the interface
as simple as possible, because I just don't have time to test a range
of different browsers.
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/pi_media_2.png" alt="screenshot of web interface" width="650px"/>
</p>
<p>
Of course, all of this software had to be custom written (in C) for
the project. The source code for all the components is available in my
<a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/vlc-server">GitHub repository</a>.
</p>
<p>
Because this is Linux, the option of using a mainstream media player
still exists, and this can be done alongside my own software.
</p>

<h3>Pi capacity</h3>
<p>
Storage capacity is a real concern for me, as I have thousands of FLAC 
albums. The Pi will accept a 512Gb USB stick which, while it won't hold
my entire collection, will accommodate a substantial part of it. There's
also the option of storing audio files on the SD card that contains the
Linux installation, although this does complicate system management a bit.
</p>

<h3>Screen</h3>
<p>
My first prototype used a 4x20 dot matrix display. These are dirt
cheap, but don't allow for a satisfactory user interface. The
'official' 7" touchscreen is fine, but it's expensive and, for a
non-desktop application, too big.
So my current choice is a 5" display like this
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Elecrow-Monitor-800x480-Display-Raspberry/dp/B013JECYF2" target="_top"/>Elecrow 5" 800x480 screen</a>.
These can be obtained more cheaply from eBay and the like -- I paid
UK&pound;12.50 for mine. 
</p>
<p>
There are two problems with these cheap screens. First, although the
vendors often claim low power consumption, I think these claims are
without the backlight on. With 50% backlight, mine draws about 1.5
amps. Second, they are slow to start. The Pi won't boot until the
display has started, which adds about five seconds to the boot time.
The overall boot time is thus about eight seconds, but I was hoping for 
less than three seconds. The 'official' screen starts in about a second.
</p>
<p>
Unlike the 'official' screen, this cheap Elecrow unit is actually designed
for panel mounting, and has proper bolt fixtures to make this possible.
Mounting the official screen in a case is, frankly, a bear.
</p>

<h3>Controls</h3>
<p>
The remote control device is one of those 'Windows Media Centre' remotes
that be obtained from eBay for a few pounds. These are widely supported
by desktop Linux media players but, if you're writing the player software
yourself, some extra work is required. That's particularly true 
<a href="console_media_keys.html">in a console application</a>.
</p>
<p>
I did experiment with adding physical control buttons to the device. 
This isn't difficult but, in fact, it's unnecessary -- it's easier just
to provide a way to clip the little remote control handset onto the
enclosure.
</p>

<h3>Power supply</h3>
<p>
The Pi, Screen, and USB audio device draw at least 3A between them, perhaps
a bit more. Even with a 3A USB power supply, I still find the under-voltage
lighting bolt on the screen fairly often. What people don't realize is
that, although the power supply can actually deliver 3A, it won't 
necessarily deliver the full 5V at that current.
</p>
<p>
An alternative approach, which I've used successfully in other projects,
is to provide a 12V power supply, with a 12V-5V converter in the 
enclosure itself. For a hifi project, however, I'd be slightly concerned
that switching noise from this converter would end up in the audio
components. Of course, there's an awful lot of RF noise from the Pi
and the screen, anyway, and this additional source might be insignificant.
There's certainly scope for experimentation in this area. 
</p>
<p>
Despite the 'lightning bolt', the Pi 3 does seem to work perfectly well
with a lower-than-specified supply voltage. This may not be true for
later Pi models.
</p>

<h3>Enclosure</h3>
<p>
When I get the size and layout spot on, I will 3D-print something. 
This won't happen until I'm sure what kind of power supply
is needed.
For now, though, the enclosure is made of Foamex -- my favourite
prototyping material. Foamex can be cut with a knife, and simple
superglue allows solid bonds between pieces. 
</p>
<p>
I've found that a Foamex construction looks a lot nicer if the final
assembly is sanded smooth and then spray-painted. This hides all the
glue joints quite nicely. Of course, a 3D-printed enclosure will be 
nicer. 
</p>
<p>
The final enclosure is about seven inches wide, five inches tall, and 
three inches deep. The size could easily be reduced, if the enclosure
were made of more rigid material. 
I mention in passing that the screen is quite heavy, which puts all
the weight at the front of the enclosure. The enclosure therefore needs
to be deeper than might be expected, or it will need to 
be weighted at the back to add stability.
</p>

<h3>Closing remarks</h3>
<p>
This prototype works fine. With the DacMagic DAC it sounds wonderful,
and the variety of different user interfaces makes it easy to find
a way to control it. The web interface works with a smartphone
browser (I took some trouble to ensure that it would), but a computer-based
browser is better. The little remote control and built-in screen allow
rapid album selection, as well as immediate access to play/pause/skip.
There's still work to do on the power supply and enclosure.
</p>
<p>
Using a Raspberry Pi as a media player is not in any way a new thing.
However, using one as a completely self-contained media player, with its
own display and controls, does require a bit of work.
The final result is pretty effective, although I did have to write about
100,000 lines of C to achieve it.
</p>
<p>
The web browser interface is fully graphical, of course. At present, the
built-in interface is a console application, and entirely text-based.
An interesting future development would be to make that graphical, too;
but I wouldn't use an X-based application, because this would
extend the start-up time still further.
