<h1>How to write a technical or scientific report</h1>

Version 2.02, December 2024 

<h2>Summary</h2>

<img class="article-top-image" src="img/report.png" 
  alt="pen"/>
<p>
This article is about writing a technical report or scientific paper. In it, I
describe the conventional 'standard model' of report writing, and some
possible alternatives. I wrote this article for students who are currently
undertaking undergraduate or master's degree projects, or expect to do so in
the near future.  However, some parts will be relevant to
people who write in the course of business.
</p>
<p>
When I first wrote this article, back in the mid-1990s, we still presented
most reports and scientific papers in printed form.  These days, web-based
publishing is commonplace, even for prestigious scientific journals.  I've
encountered the view that it's OK for web-based articles to be rushed and
crude, that they don't have to reach the same authorial standards that apply
to print. I would argue that the opposite is the case -- there is so much
material on the web, both reliable and unreliable, that a high standard of
clarity and organization is <i>more</i> important there than in print.
There's just too much online, to force ourselves to read things
that are disorganized or stylistically jarring.  
</p>
<p>
Please note that I'm writing primarily for a British readership. Some
of what follows may be relevant in other English-speaking countries, 
but I can't be sure.

<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>
The ability to write clear, concise reports is an asset to almost any
professional. In this article I offer some general guidelines on report
writing, focusing particularly on something I call the 'standard model'. This
standard model is a formalization of the way we 
have typically written scientific 
and technical articles over the last seventy years or so.
While the standard model has its faults, and some writers use it 
inappropriately, it still has a lot to recommend it. I normally suggest to
students who don't have much writing experience that they follow this model
unless they have good reasons not to. In this article I  also try to
explain <i>why</i> we teach students to write in a particular way.
<a name="2 Fundamentals"></a>
</p>
<h2>2 Fundamentals</h2>
<p>
The main purpose of a scientific or technical report is to convey information.
The report should place as few hindrances as possible between the minds of the
writer and the reader. A secondary function is to stimulate and
entertain. There are people -- a tiny minority -- who can inform and entertain
at the same time. If, like most people, you have to make a choice between the
two, you should try to inform rather than to entertain. Of course, if you're
writing a novel or a screenplay the priorities are different; but in technical 
writing clarity of information is paramount. 
</p>
<p>
 A good report needs careful planning. As part of the planning stage you
should try to answer the following questions. 
</p>
<ul>
<li> First, what is the report <i>about</i>? What are you trying to say? You
should arrange material so that key facts and conclusions are early 
and accessible. Not
everyone will read the whole report, so ensure that your message will get
across even if a reader only skims it. Many people have an attention
span of only a few minutes, when reading something they aren't immediately
captivated by.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Who are you writing for? It is impossible to write a technical document
that will be equally easy for everybody to read, regardless of expertise.  
It is essential to identify the potential readers
-- the professional group, if not the individuals -- before you start writing.
You should keep in mind that you probably know more about your subject than
your readers do.  If you are writing for computer scientists, for example, you
probably don't need to explain what software is, nor the World-Wide Web, but
you might need to explain how phase modulation works, or what JMS stands
for. 
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> How long can the report be? 
You should be able to decide as a minimum whether you expect to 
write 2&nbsp;000 words or 20&nbsp;000 words, for example.
It's generally harder to
write a short report than a long one, because it requires much better
organisation. In the academic environment there may be institutional
limitations on the size of the report. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<a name="3 The standard model"></a>
<h2>3 The standard model</h2>
<p>
The 'standard model' of report writing is a style and structure we've 
used widely in the western world for about seventy years. It is the reporting
method that we usually teach (sometimes badly) in schools. Contrary to what we
learned in school,  however, it is <i>not</i> the only accepted way to
write professionally. Nevertheless, it is the way that many 
scientists and engineers choose to write. The main elements of a 'standard
model' report are as follows. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>There's an <i>abstract</i> that sums up the entire report.
</li>
<li>The first major section is an introduction; the last is 
a conclusion. The
conclusion answers questions posed -- explicitly or otherwise -- in the
introduction.</li>
<li>Factual material and measurements are <i>completely separate from
opinion and interpretation</i>, often in different chapters or sections.</li>
<li>Formal, and rather impersonal, language is used (often too much).</li>
<li>The report usually refers extensively to the work of others.</li>
<li>The sections of the report are often numbered.</li>
</ul>
<p>
 Most 'standard model' reports will contain some or all of the following sections, <i>usually in this order</i>. I'll discuss sach of these sections in more detail below. </p>
<blockquote>
Abstract or summary;
Acknowledgements;
Introduction;
Objectives;
Theory;
Method (or methodology or procedure);
Results;
Discussion or interpretation;
Conclusions;
Recommendations;
References and/or bibliography;
Appendices.
</blockquote>
<p>
 A standard report, if it is more than a few pages long, will probably also
contain a table of contents, a list of abbreviations and technical terms, and
perhaps an index if it is very long. 
</p>
<a name="3.1 Abstract or summary"></a>
<h3>3.1 The abstract or summary</h3>
<p>
An 'abstract' or 'summary' (these words mean essentially the same thing)
contains a brief overview of the report, including its conclusions and
recommendations if there are any. A good length for an abstract is about 300
words: many scientific journals specify this word count explicitly. The
abstract of a scientific paper or report should be capable of standing alone,
and of being published separately. For this reason we don't usually include
the abstract in the report's numbering scheme.
</p>
<a name="3.2 Introduction"></a>
<h3>3.2 The introduction section</h3>
<p>
The introduction states what the report is about, and its
relationship to other work in the field. If the report is about
experimental work, the introduction will often 
summarise other, related experiments, and show how the
new work extends or supersedes earlier studies. If the report
is about development (of software or a product, for example) 
the introduction typically 
sets out the purpose of the development, who will benefit, and how it
will be used. A report that is a review of existing work
will usually just state its scope, purpose, and  
intended readership. 
</p><p> 
My preference in scientific writing is to finish the introduction with a list
of questions that the project set out to answer. I would then give the answers
to these questions in the 'conclusion' section. I like to be quite explicit
about this, and sometimes even label the questions 'Question 1', 'Question 2',
and so on.  Whether you do this or not, the reader should be able to look at
the conclusion of your report, and verify that you have indeed found out what
you claimed you would find out. 
<a name="3.3 Objectives"></a>
<h3>3.3 The objectives section</h3>
<p> 
This section, if present, states what you expected the work to achieve, why
you undertook it, and at whose instigation. I usually prefer to put this
information in the introduction, but this is just a matter of
taste.</p> 
<a name="3.4 Acknowledgements"></a>
<h3>3.4 The acknowledgements section</h3>
<p> 
It is polite to give a brief note of thanks to those people who have helped <i>directly</i> in the work the report describes. In a novel, authors often thank their friends and family;  I consider it pretentious to do this in a technical report, unless you actually regard them as co-workers. 
</p><p> 
If the report describes work supported by grant funding, the funding 
body may insist that it be acknowledged. 
</p><p>
It is not uncommon to see acknowledgements at the end of a report, rather
than the beginning. 
</p>
 <a name="3.5 Theory"></a>
</p>
<h3>3.5 The theory section</h3>
<p>
The theory section, if used, describes any technical or mathematical 
background that a reader
should know, to be able understand the report. You probably don't need
to explain the properties of logarithms, but you probably will need
to explain the principles of calculus of variations, if that's something
you use in your analysis. In the end, the amount of theory you need to
explicate depends on your readership. 
</p>
<p>
If the theory is so extensive that it might have to be studied rather than
just skimmed, it's probably better to place it in an appendix.  If you do that
it's still helpful, in my view, to provide a brief outline in the body of the
report.
</p>
<a name="3.6 Method"></a>
<h3>3.6 The methods (method, methodology) section</h3>
<p>
In the 'methods' section you should describe how you carried out the work,
what equipment you used, how you collected data, and any particular
methodological problems (not personal or financial problems) you had to
overcome.  If the report is describing a survey -- common in the social
sciences -- you should say how you chose your subjects, how you checked for
bias, and how you analysed the results. If you used commercial computer
software, custom dictates that you should state who supplied it, even when it
is obvious or irrelevant.
</p>
<a name="3.7 Results"></a>
<h3>3.7 The results section</h3>
<p>
In the standard model, we usually state results as plainly as possible,
without any comment or analysis. It is often difficult to know how much 
raw data
to put into this section. My view is that you should include enough data to
enable to reader to be confident that you have done what you said you would
do, so your conclusions are trustworthy. This certainly does not mean
that you should include reams of print-outs or copies of questionnaire
returns. I try to summarise the results into a few tables and graphs. 
</p><p> 
If you really need to include a large volume of results -- and sometimes
a conclusion will not be defensible without doing this -- then it might
be more useful to place them in an appendix, and include only an outline 
in the body of the report.
</p><p> 
<b>Most readers who are used to reading scientific reports will become
uncomfortable if you call a section 'results' and put anything in it apart
from plain, uninterpreted results.</b> 
<a name="3.8 Discussion"></a>
</p>
<h3>3.8 The discussion section</h3>
<p>
This section provides your interpretation of your results, compares them with
other published findings -- if there are  any -- and points out any potential
shortcomings in the work.  As the author, you are allowed (perhaps expected)
to be less objective in this section than elsewhere: you may state opinions,
and  speculate about the significance of the results.  
</p><p> 
If your findings are unexpected, or very much at odds with
established views, you should explain why this might be the case, or the
reader will probably assume you just made a mistake. If your findings
are at odds with established views, and you <i>don't know</i> why, you
should admit that, rather than just ignoring the situation. 
<a name="3.9 Conclusion"></a>
<h3>3.9 The conclusions section</h3>
<p>
The conclusions section states the overall findings of the work, as you
interpret them.  It is important to realise that 'conclusion' does <i>not</i>
just mean 'the last bit of the report'. Your conclusions must be definitive
statements that a reader can safely conclude from the work. A conclusion is
not a summary (you can include a summary as  well, if you like).  When I
examine students' reports, one of the questions I ask is: do the conclusions
follow from the body of the report?  
</p>
<a name="3.10 Recommendations"></a>
<h3>3.10 The recommendations section</h3>
<p>
In this section you may give any advice that you think follows from the
conclusions.  If the report is about making some sort of business decision,
you should offer your suggested course of action here.  Some writers use the
recommendations sections for suggestions for further work, which seems
reasonable to me. 
</p>
<a name="3.11 References and bibliography"></a>

<h3>3.11 The references and bibliography</h3>
<p> 
The purpose of citing references is to allow the reader to  follow up your
sources of supporting information, and thus to ensure that the conclusions you draw really follow from your work and those sources. 
After all, in science and technology we're ususually
extending an existing body of knowledge, not starting from scratch.
References are not, as many students appear to think, a method for convincing
an examiner that you have read a lot. You should cite references in enough
detail that  a reader could actually find your sources, even if
most readers won't actually do so.  For books, we
conventionally give the authors, year, edition (if there's more than one),
publisher's name and publisher's location, and page numbers. 
In reality, an ISBN number is
sufficient to locate a book, but it's polite to give more information. For
articles in journals, give the authors, year, name of the publication, volume
and page numbers. If you can't give all these details, you probably don't have
a proper reference. 
</p><p> 
The rise in web-based publishing has created its own citation problems. The
same basic principle applies, however: the
citation must be sufficient to allow a reader to locate the source of your
information. If possible, you should cite a URL that will take the reader
directly to the document you cite. Giving the URL for a website 
is generally not helpful. As a matter of style, you should give the names
of the authors and the publication date, if you are able to determine them.
If you can't, then a reference to a web page probably won't carry a lot
of weight. 
</p><p> 
Although it is not peculiar to web-based publication, you should be aware that
not all citations have equal weight. References to articles in peer-reviewed
journals will be more convincing than references to non-reviewed sources,
particularly self-published ones.  Since anyone can publish anything on a web
site, there is a real risk of citing something that is not authoritative.  In
academic circles, references to Wikipedia and similar sites, although often
invaluable for research, usually have no authority whatsoever, for better or
worse.
</p><p> 
 Many students confuse 'references' with 
'bibliography'. A bibliography is the set of publications to which you 
referred <i>in a general sense</i> while writing 
the report or carrying out
the work it describes. These publications will not usually be cited explicitly
in the text. References, on the other hand, are given in support of some
specific assertion, so you will have mentioned them explicitly in the text. 
Normally
the citation is given after the statement the author wants to support. A
common method is to give the authors and year in the text, e.g, (Bloggs, 1995),
and the full details at the end of  the report or in a footnote. 
</p><p> 
 In scientific writing, if you make any statement that is not one of plain
fact or measurement, you <i>must</i> justify it using your own reasoning, or
refer the reader to another publication that justifies it.  The making of
unjustified assertions is probably the single most common criticism leveled at
students' writing.
</p><p> 
 If you use another person's words directly, you <i>must</i> be clear that
you're doing this, and give a full reference to the original text. If you use
more than a few words, or a picture, or experimental results, you should seek
the author's permission first, and state in your report that you obtained such
permission. If you don't do this you're potentially breaking the law, as well
as being unprofessional. <a name="3.12
Appendices"></a>
</p><h3>3.12 The appendices</h3>
<p>
You should include as appendices information that would break up the
flow of the report, and which you don't expect everybody to read.
I typically use appendices for mathematical proofs, electrical circuit
diagrams and sections of computer programs.  <a name="3.13 Numbering and
structure"></a>
</p>
<h3>3.13 Numbering and structure</h3>
<p>
It is common to number each section of the report. Usually numbering starts at
the introduction, which has number '1', and continues until the 'references'
section.  Because they are, in a sense, independent of the body of the report,
the abstract and references section are not usually numbered. Most writers
number sub-sections as well as main sections. So, for example, section one,
sub-section two would be numbered '1.2'.  Others prefer numbers and letters,
e.g., 1A, 1B..., which is also fine.  The advantage of using a hierarchical
numbering scheme is that it helps to orient the reader in the report. 
</p>
<a name="3.14 When should you use the standard model?"></a>
<h3>3.14 When should you use the standard model?</h3>
<p>
In my opinion, writers of technical reports should use something
close to this standard model, unless there is a sound reason not to. Why? First, and
most  important, its use is so widespread that the reader will know exactly
what to expect in each section.  Even people who are not familiar with this
type of report will find the clear section divisions useful. Second, the rigid
organisation of the report will help the novice writer organise his or her
thoughts when writing.  
</p><p> 
 There are times when the standard model will be a hindrance, rather than a
help. In such cases you should cheerfully abandon it. Even when you
do use the standard model, you
won't always need to include every sections. A 'results' section, for
example, is only useful if you're actually reporting results or measurements.  
</p>
<a name="4 Alternatives to the standard model"></a>
<h2>4 Alternatives to the standard model</h2>
Here are a few suggestions for other ways to organise a technical report,
all of which I've seen used successfully.  
<a name="4.1 The 'segmented' standard model"></a>
<h3>4.1 The 'segmented' standard model</h3>
<p> 
If a report describes a set of investigations with a common purpose, but
different methodologies, it can be rather difficult to use the standard model,
even if each individual investigation could be reported that way. In this case
it is useful to give each experiment its own segment with a 'methods'
and 'results' section, but a single overall introduction and discussion.
In the segments, you do not necessarily need to use explicit
sub-sections for methods and results, as long as the reader is clear where the
boundaries are. 
</p>
<a name="4.2 The 'assertion' model"></a>
<h3>4.2 The 'assertion' model</h3>
<p>
Assertion-based organization can be very effective when used appropriately,
but it's more common in presentations than in written reports.
In this type of
writing, rather than using generic section titles like 'Introduction', you'd 
use assertive, explanatory headings, like  'The new protocol improves
communication efficiency by 23%'. The headings together make up a summary of
the report. Of course, if you make an assertion you then have to go on to
defend it, and that defence will form the body of each section.
 The advantage of this type of writing is that the reader
can get an overall idea what the report says simply by scanning the headings.
A valid criticism of the standard model is that
the reader <i>can't</i> extract any information merely by skimming the
headings, as they are non-informative.
</p>
<a name="4.3 The 'conclusion first' model"></a>
<h3>4.3 The 'conclusion first' model</h3>
<p>
In this type of report, the writer presents the conclusions towards the
beginning, perhaps directly after the introduction. In my opinion one should
re-state or summarise the conclusions at the end of the report as well,
otherwise the report ends abruptly. The advantage of placing the conclusions
at the beginning is that they are more likely to be read. This organization
also allows the reader to have the conclusions in mind while reading the rest
of the report. I don't use this kind of writing myself: I prefer to put a
summary of the conclusions in the abstract.  
</p>
<a name="4.4 The 'topic' model"></a>
<h3>4.4 The 'topic' model</h3>
<p>
In this type of report, each section is on a particular topic or subject, but
there will probably be a common introduction and conclusion. This structure is
appropriate for review or instructional articles, but probably not so much for
scientific papers. The problem is that it does not aid in establishing the
clear divisions between methodology, results, and interpretation that most
readers will expect. 
</p>
<a name="5 Language, style and presentation"></a>
<h2>5 Language, style and presentation</h2>
<p>
If your message is one of profound importance, readers will absorb it 
even if you present it badly. On the whole, however, few scientific and
technical reports contain ground-breaking findings, and you'll need to 
pay attention to the presentation.
</p>
<a name="5.1 Grammar and spelling"></a>

<h3>5.1 Grammar and spelling</h3>
<p> 
Most academics and scientists, and many businesspeople, are 
fussy about grammar and spelling. 
If reading forms a substantial part of your work, after all, 
you'll be most productive if everyone follows
similar standards of grammar and spelling. If you want to avoid
alienating or inconveniencing your readers,
you need your grammar and spelling to be impeccable. 
</p><p> 
 If they aren't especially good, and particularly if
you're not working in your native language, it's vital that you have your
work read by someone else before you decide that it's finished (I think that
everyone should do this anyway). At the very least you should get a printed
copy of your document (not on a computer screen) and check it very thoroughly
yourself, word by word. Many of us, including me, have become adept at skimming over our own
errors without even spotting them, which makes the process of personal
proof-reading rather unproductive. Enlisting help here is very much worthwhile. </p>
<p>
Most readers won't care whether you use British or American spelling and word
choices -- increasingly we are unable to tell the difference, anyway. However,
my experience is that many readers have a sharp eye for inconsistency -- if
you write 'color' on one line, and 'colour' on the next, it might diminish
your credibility. 
</p>
<a name="5.2 Style"></a>
<h3>5.2 Style</h3>
<p> 
Most technical documents are written in a rather formal style.  Some readers
become disgruntled when they have to read reports that are written informally,
but I don't mind this. However, what does annoy me as a reader is sudden
changes from formal to informal writing -- it gives the impression that the
writing wasn't planned properly. 
</p><p> 
 In the UK, 'passive voice' expressions have long dominated academic writing,
as authors struggle to avoid using the word 'I'. Personally, I use the word
'I' freely even in my most formal writing, and I encourage others to do
likewise.  If you prefer not to, that's fine, but you should try to avoid
writing very ugly phrases and clichés just to avoid the word 'I'. For example,
a phrase I see all the time in  scientific articles is 'It is the opinion of
the author that...' This means <i>exactly</i> the same as 'I believe...' but
has four times as many words.  Lawyers tend to write 'It is submitted that...'
to mean the same thing.  The worst affront of this type is the <i>double
passive</i>: "It is regretted that further data was unable to be collected
from this subject." What the author meant was: "Unfortunately, we could not
collect more data from this subject".  Authors must make up their own minds
about the good points and bad  points of different styles, but should do so
after careful consideration, rather than according to dogma. 
</p><p> 
 We probably overuse passive-voice expressions because we're trying to  give
an impression of impartiality -- a characteristic we expect of
scientists.  I don't think many readers will be fooled into thinking that,
just because you use the passive voice, you actually  <i>are</i>  impartial,
but that's just my opinion. 
</p><p> 
 In general, I think appropriate humour is fine in a technical  report. But if
your report is about, say, detection of bowel cancers, what sort of humour is
likely to be appropriate? Feeble jokes could detract badly from the message you
want to convey. Nevertheless, occasionally humour works. 
</p><p> 
 On the whole you should probably not write in the exact way you speak, for
two reasons.  First, you probably use colloquial and ungrammatical expressions
in your speech, that some readers will not understand. A reader cannot stop
you and ask you to clarify. Second, in writing you don't have access to the
emphasis and tone of voice that modulates spoken  communication.  As you have
to rely entirely on the words themselves, you'll need to choose them with
care. 
</p><p>
Have said that, I confess that I prefer to read colloquial speech idioms, 
over a stuffy, affected academic style. 
</p><p>
One final point on style: I think that many principles of good
<i>general</i> writing apply equally to report writing. Maxims like "prefer
verbs to nouns", "prefer the specific to the general", and "minimize
modifiers" apply to all kinds of writing. I won't go into more details
here, because these guidelines are well-documented elsewhere. Just be
aware that there's nothing about scientific writing that demands 
ungainly, over-generalized prose with no verbs except "is". 
</p>

<a name="5.3 Presentation"></a>
<h3>5.3 Presentation</h3>
<p> 
I suggest -- with some hesitation -- that in science, good visual
presentation is less important than sound technical content. However, that
doesn't mean it is irrelevant: the first impression your report makes on a
reader will likely be created by its visual style. 
</p><p> 
With modern computer software, it is relatively easy for anybody to prepare
elegant printed documents and web pages. Even complex mathematics can 
be typeset
stylishly using tools like LaTeX, using nothing more than a PC.
The ubiquitous word processor does not much help with <i>consistency</i>,
however.  A document is consistent if, for example, it always uses the same
typeface for headings, if all lines have the same spacing, if
all pictures are aligned similarly on the page, and so on. A simple way to
ensure consistency is to print the document and have it looked at by an
impartial, critical person. Even for on-line publication, I think there's
something to be said for reviewing a printed copy, although I appreciate that
we have to conserve trees. 
</p><p> 
 The final part of the preparation of a printed report is usually binding.  It
doesn't cost very much to have a report spiral-bound, and it will be much
easier to read than if it is stapled or ring-bound.  Hot glue binding can be
very effective (and cheap) for thin documents. Unless there are rules to the
contrary, it is probably not worth the effort and expense of hard binding a
report. I like to receive reports that are glue-bound or spiral-bound in
plastic covers, so I can read them in the bathtub without getting wet
fingerprints on the pages.
</p>

<a name="5.4 Inclusivity"></a>
<h3>5.4 Inclusivity</h3>
<p> 
Issues of inclusivity now affect all writers and, while I can advise
sensitivity in this area, it's hard to give general advice.  It's all too
easy, particularly in science and engineering, to write in a way that subtly
excludes or diminishes particular groups of people. The days are long gone
when we could write "he" and "him", and assume that the reader would
understand that these terms included the other half of the human race as well.
</p>
<p>
We won't solve this problem, unfortunately, by simply avoiding overtly
gender-laden terms.  Particular modes of expression are so entrenched in some
industries that we no longer really notice that they might be problematic.  A
female colleague recently suggested that a woman would not have started using
terms like "terminate" or "abort" to mean "stop a computer program". Maybe so;
perhaps widespread use of such terms does subliminally "masculinize" the
computing industry, particularly when they are ubiquitous.
</p>
<p> 
Similarly, institutional and editorial standards increasingly encourage
us to avoid terms that seem tacitly to legitimize slavery and
racism.  Such standards discourage terms like "master", for example 
-- a word which has
among its many meanings some that are not remotely associated with slavery.
Perhaps a term like "blacklist", in the sense of "to exclude", has racist
overtones; this is a term that I have used many times, without really being
aware of this possibility. I now avoid using it, although the alternatives
are inelegant.
</p> 
<p> 
The problem that every writer has to tackle here is that of finding balance.
Of course we need to avoid derogatory and discriminatory terms in professional
writing, but it's increasingly difficult to write in a way that we can be 
certain will cause no offence to anybody at all.  I've been criticised for
using the phrase "bring home the bacon" in a training manual. Some religious
groups do not eat bacon and, I was told, "normalizing" the eating of bacon can
be seen as exclusionary.  As a vegetarian, I don't eat bacon either, but it
doesn't offend me to see the word in print. Sadly, avoiding every possible way
in which we might inadvertently give offence leads to very bland writing.
</p> 
<p> 
I've been writing professionally for decades, but I have to confess
that I don't have a solution to this problem, and it gets more acute
every year. Being aware of the potential problems is a start, but only
a start. 
</p> 

<a name="6 Visual material"></a>
<h2>6 Graphic material</h2>
<p>
Few technical reports consist only of text.
Here are a few hints on including graphical material, 
which I concede that many readers will find obvious. <p></p>
</p>
<ul>
<li> Label everything. All charts and graphs should have a caption and perhaps
a number ('Figure 1'). It's no good writing "In the figure below..." unless
you have complete control over the document's layout. Check that, when you
refer to figures in the text, the references are correct. You might add or
remove figures, then forget to update all the cross-references.  If you use
document-preparation software that has support for automatic cross-reference
management, consider using it.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> If you prepare graphs in colour, then print them on a monochrome printer,
they may become unreadable. For example, it may be impossible to distinguish
between a line that was originally back and one that was blue.  Some computer
software automatically converts coloured graphs to use dotted and dashed lines
on a monochrome printer, but most does not. It's a good idea to keep this
problem in mind even for web-based publishing, because web browsers sometimes
allow the user to control colour rendering.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Film photographs do not usually photocopy very well. For a printed
document, you may need to get extra prints made of photographs so that you can
include prints with each copy of the report. To be fair, film photography is
now used only in specialized applications.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Unlike in an advertising or promotional brochure, colour presentation is
not usually worth the extra effort in a printed technical document (except in
certain subjects, like computer graphics and multimedia). Even now, many
scientific journals do not print in colour, or will only do so if given a
financial incentive. It's worth checking this before starting work on the
report. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Computer software that is designed for producing slide presentations will
often not use sensible type sizes when drawing diagrams for printing on paper.
A good size for text labels on a diagram in print is 12-14 points, and the
diagram should be scaled accordingly. </li>
</ul>
<a name="7 Things to avoid"></a>
<h2>7 Things to avoid</h2>
<p>
Here, in no particular order, are some suggestions of things to avoid in a
technical or scientific report. Please note that I am not saying they should
be avoided in all types of writing; but a technical report has a particular
function and audience, and the writing should reflect this. Naturally, this
section describes things that <i>I</i> particularly dislike.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid clichés and stock phrases if you can. <i>Clichés</i> are phrases
that seemed elegant or stylish in the past, but are now so over-used that they
annoy the reader. Your reader is quite likely to have seen the same cliché
used several times that same day. Here are some particularly common examples:
'At the end of  the day...', '...explore every avenue',  'Not to put too fine
a point on it...', 'Going forward, we will...' The late Terry Pratchett
defended Clichés as the "grease on the axles of communication". Maybe they
are; but too much grease leads to a sticky mess.
<p></p> 
 Stock phrases are slightly different from clichés; they're used not because
they scan well, but because we get so used to reading them that we feel a
subliminal pressure to write them. Particular examples include 'At this point
in time...', and 'In the opinion of the author...' You might be able to replace
these phrases with a single word.  For example 'At this point in time...' can
usefully be replaced by 'Now...'.
<p></p> 
 Some people use stock phrases because they don't have anything else to say;
it's best to find something to
say starting to say it. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Avoid giving too much raw data. I suspect that some writers overload a
report with  
data for the same reason that others employ useless stock phrases:
they don't have much to say. I favour including only a summary of
experimental data in a report.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Avoid poems, quotations, and other non-technical material unless there is
a very clear need for them. This sort of content is inoffensive when it
relates to the subject of the report, but annoying if it does not. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Avoid including program listings and long mathematical proofs if you 
can. It's unlikely that anyone will want to read them, and anyone who does can ask you for a copy later. If you must include them, put them in an appendix. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is probably a bad idea to include statements about how difficult the
work was, and how the report would have been better if you'd had more time to
write it. Students often say this sort of thing in reports and, frankly,
it doesn't
look very professional.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Try to avoid my usual mistake -- one I've made frequently in this document
-- of making everything a bullet-point. A more elegant alternative is to write
paragraphs that start with a short heading, that can be emphasised.
Bullet-points come from the days of typewriters, when we had no other way to
emphasize specific points. It's a habit that I struggle to break.</li>
</ul>

<a name="8 General guidelines"></a>
<h2>8 General guidelines</h2>
<p>
Finally, here are a few general suggestions, in no particular order. <p></p>
</p>
<ul>
<li> Decide what you want to say, then say it. It's difficult to think about
what conclusions to draw from your investigation, while you're writing 
those conclusions. When you come to write a report, you should
be in a position to think only about writing, not about investigation or
data  interpretation. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
Before you write very much, check whether there are standards of authorship
to which you must conform. As an undergraduate student, you may find that your
institution has rules about how you should present a report. At doctoral level
it almost certainly will. Some institutions specify exactly which typefaces to
use for various levels of heading, and so on. For journal publication, you'll
probably find that you have to provide either camera-ready copy, or plain text
with separate figures. 'Camera-ready' means that you provide the
finished material, ready to go to the press. You'll have to do all the
formatting and layout yourself, according to the journal's rules, and
using the journal's preferred software.  For most
journals, however, you'll be expected to provide plain text -- no layout or
formatting -- with the figures on separate pages. I mention this because
there's no point spending time getting the flow of text around your figures
exactly right, when you'll end up putting them on separate pages. 
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> You don't have to write the report in the same order you  expect it to be
read. Very often the introduction is the hardest thing to write, as you need
to have in mind your conclusions when you write it. A lot of writers start by
writing ''1. Introduction'' and then  spend a few hours staring at a blank
screen. It's perhaps better to write first the parts of the report that deal
with methodology and procedures, as no interpretation is
involved. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> A shorter report is a better report. If you can say the same in
2&nbsp;000 words as in 5&nbsp;000, you should.  Most people, including
myself, tend write too much. Having written a first draft, I can readily
remove about 20% of the words with no loss of meaning. Be ruthless: edit your
work thoroughly after writing. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> People find it hard to be critical of their own work. I suggest that you
regard everything you write as a draft, until at least one other person has
read it. That other person need not be an expert in the subject; in fact it is
often better if you choose someone who is not. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Make all important style and authorship decisions before you  start
writing. Decide in advance, for example, the degree of  balance between
formality and informality you prefer, whether you will favour the passive or
the active voice, and so on. Having made these decisions, stick to them. If
you change your mind, make sure you change the whole report. Major stylistic
changes in the middle of a document could annoy the reader. </li> </ul>
<ul>
<li> It's usually better not to edit your document <i>at all</i> until you
have written the whole thing to first-draft  standard. Yes, I advised
ruthless editing earlier; 
but there's a proper time for that. It's easy to get bogged
down in the details of individual sentences, only to find later that you
need to remove whole sections. 
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Writing good reports is difficult, and often takes longer than
we anticipate. If possible, allow yourself at least twice as much
time as you first think you'll need. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<a name="Bibliography"></a>
<h2>Bibliography</h2>
<p>
There are many good books on the subject of technical writing, but, in my
opinion, none of these are written  by or for scientists. The following books
are the ones to which I referred when I started teaching. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Burchfield RW (1996) <i>Fowler's modern  English usage</i> 3<sup>rd</sup> edition (Oxford: Oxford University Press)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>King LS (1978) <i>Why not say it clearly?</i> (Boston: Little, Brown and Company)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>O'Connor M (1991) <i>Writing successfully in science</i>  (London: Chapman Hall)</li>
</ul>
<p>
 Of these, O'Connor (1991) is probably the most accessible for beginners, but
the style it advocates is a bit stuffy for my taste.  I can't be sure that any
of these books (apart from <i>Fowler's</i>) are still in print, but in any
case you should look for a book that suits your own preference.
