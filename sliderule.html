<h1>They don't make them like that any more: the slide rule</h1>
<p>
<img class="article-top-image" src="img/integral.jpg" 
  alt="terminal"/>
I should say from the outset that, in fact, they <i>do</i> still
make them -- at least for specialist purposes. 
When I was learning to fly,
about twenty years ago, I had to demonstrate my proficiency with the
Pooley's CRP-1 -- essentially a circular slide rule. Here is
what it looks like: 
</p>

<p align="center">
 <img src="img/sliderule_crp_1.jpg" alt="Pooley's CRP-1" />
</p>

<p>
The CRP-1 was, and still is, optimized for calculations relevant 
to aviation, like 
journey time and fuel consumption. 
These are essentially multiplication problems -- a
kind of arithmetic at which the slide rule excels. 
</p>
<p>
The CPR-1 is made from a kind of plasticized cardboard. This
construction has the 
advantage that you can write on it with a chinagraph pencil, and
clean it off later. It weighs almost nothing -- important 
in the kind of airplane where you have to skip lunch to get under the loading 
limit -- and, of course, requires
no power apart from your finger muscles. The thought of
using such a device, whilst diverting around a thunderstorm and
negotiating with the air traffic controller, even now brings me
out in a cold sweat; but at least it would be plausible. Maybe. 
</p>
<p>
The slide rule was so integral to aviation that 
you could, and still can, buy watches that incorporate a rotating
slide rule. The picture below shows the Breitling <i>Navitimer</i> --
a timepiece whose extraordinary beauty is rivalled only by its price.
It's not mine, I'm sorry to say, as I still have both my kidneys. 
</p>

</p>

<p>
For the professional engineer or scientist, specialist suppliers
made slide rules of staggering complexity -- some with thirty or so
different scales. If you're under fifty years of age, it's likely
that you've never used a slide rule, or perhaps even seen one. But if you
had the great good fortune to use one at school, you probably had 
a basic model like the one shown below.
</p>

<p align="center">
 <img src="img/sliderule_basic.jpg" alt="Basic slide rule" />
</p>

<p>
Rudimentary slide rules like this were all plastic in
construction, and could be
had for a few pounds from any stationer. 
They were virtually indestructible, even when used for
classroom sword-fights. A simple elastic band could propel the slide across the
classroom with startling velocity.  These devices were waterproof, and could
easily be washed to remove snot, blood, eye jelly, and the other detritus of a
British state education. 
</p>

<p>
In case you don't know, a slide rules uses the properties of
logarithms to perform calculations involving multiplication, 
powers, scaling, and reciprocals. Fundamentally, moving the
slide amounts to addition on a number line, but addition
of logarithms amounts to multiplication. 
</p>

<p>
At least in the western world, manufacturers adopted some uniformity in how
they labeled and organized the scales on their devices. 
The basic multiplication
scales were in pairs called A and B, C and D. The difference 
between these pairs of scales is the range -- The A/B scales had twice the
range of the C/D scales. However, logarithms being what they are, this
means that the D scale showed the square root of the corresponding
point on the A scale (ditto B and C). So the operator could perform
square/square root computations with ease. The slide rule in the 
photo above has a K scale, which has three times the length of
the C/D scales, and therefore has a cube/cube root relationship with
those scales. The L scale was actually linear, and could therefore be used
to calculate logarithms against the C/D scales. Because the number
<i>pi</i> is so important, it usually has its own mark on each scale. 
</p>

<p>
My basic slide rule had scales on only one side; flipping
it over showed conversion tables -- feet to metres, that kind of thing.
However, professional slide rules often had scales on both sides,
and could do trigonometry calculations of various types. I don't
recall that I ever had to do trigonometry at school using a slide rule
-- devices with such capabilities were too expensive.
</p>

<p>
I'm not so old that I ever used a slide rule professionally. Whilst it
was a symbol of geek credibility -- and an opportunity for a punch
in the eye -- to carry a slide rule at college, the
reality is that these devices were obsolete by the 1980s. Still, 
I remember working with people whose capabilities with a slide rule
were extraordinary.
</p>

<p>
Slide rules particularly excelled at scaling problems. Suppose, for example,
that I had to make a metal part from a scale drawing. The scale might
be, perhaps, 1 to 24 -- that is, 1 mm on the drawing is 24 mm on 
on the physical part. I could set my slide rule to multiply by 24, 
then I wouldn't
have to touch the slide again as I carried out as many multiplications
as I needed, just by reading the relevant scale.  
</p>

<p>
At best, this would give me 2-3 significant figures of precision, but
that was fine -- I couldn't cut metal any more precisely than that.
</p>

<p>
But the old guys -- people who were as old then as I am now --
could work out <i>sin(x<sup>2</sup>) * sin (y<sup>2</sup>)</i>.
before I could switch on my calculator.
Ironically, they couldn't do basic addition on a slide rule -- nobody could.
But a person who had spent his entire career doing 
slide rule computation would be able to add two or three-digit numbers
mentally with no hesitation. 
</p>

<p>
A big problem with the slide rule was its size. Although pocketable
slide rules did exist, they offered relatively poor accuracy.
It was also difficult to operate them one-handed which is why,
I guess, circular slide rules were prevalent in aviation: you
could operate the slide rule with one hand, and steer the plane
with the other. In principle, at least. It's not so easy in 
practice, I can tell you.
</p>

<p>
Still, a number of manufacturers did offer general-purpose circular
slide rules, like the Halden <i>Calculex</i> show below. I have
no idea whether devices like this were really intended to be used, or
were just art objects. They do rather look like props from a 
fantasy movie -- a real-world aelethiometer, perhaps?
</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p>
In the end, the slide rule fell out of favour in professional circles
and, eventually, even in education. That's sad, because
to use a slide rule requires a real appreciation of how numbers 
work. In general, every computation on a slide rule works on 
numbers in the range 1-10, and produces a result in the same range.
A slide rule won't tell me that 64 x 72 = 4608 -- it will tell 
me that 6.4 x 7.2 = 4.608 times some power of ten. Actually, it will
at best give me the result 4.61 -- 4.608 requires more precision
than a slide rule offers. In any case, the operator must handle 
the power-of-ten scaling, either mentally, or on paper. Learning
how to do this is no bad thing. 
</p>

<p>
The lack of precision wasn't always a problem, even though most competent
operator could rarely get better than three significant figures.
However, the precision got worse with larger numbers, because the
scale was increasingly compact at the right-hand end. 
</p>

<p>
Trivial operator error was also commonplace. In the photo of the basic
slide rule above, you'll see that the CI ('C inverse') scale is
drawn in red, because the numbers run the wrong way, compared to
all the other scales. It's all too easy to forget this, when looking
at a number in the middle of the scale and read, say, 3.1 as
2.9. The trig scales were particularly fiddly in that respect, I'm told -- 
they generally had different scales for different parts of the angle. 
</p>
<p>
Another problem with the slide rule is that the expertise you need to
operate it has to be maintained by constant practice. It's all very 
well to keep a CRP-1 in your airplane cockpit against the unexpected
failure of your modern avionics; but if the last time you used it
was in training, relearning it in an emergency will be no fun
at all. The same applies, of course, to other uses of a slide rule,
albeit in less of a panic. 
</p>

<p>
With the exception of aviation, it's now easier to buy an abacus than
a slide rule. For educational purposes you can print your own slide
rule, and glue it to a cardboard template.
I've heard of teachers doing that for classroom instruction, but
I wonder how many students understand what's going on? To be fair,
we didn't understand how slide rules 'worked' back in the 
70s -- we just learned by rote the required manipulations. Using a slide
rule only offers a didactic benefit if you take the trouble to 
learn the properties of logarithms.
</p>

<p>
Despite all these limitations, the slide rule has a couple 
of benefits compared to modern
electronics, even outside education.
First, it needs no power. This was the reason
my flying instructor gave for learning to use the CRP-1. It didn't convince
me then, and it doesn't now -- if my <i>plane</i> runs out of power,
an inability to do arithmetic won't be my biggest worry. Still, I can
certainly think of situations where I might not have access to a 
reliable power supply.  
</p>

<p>
Second -- a plastic slide rule will last forever. It will never wear
out or degrade. When our civilization has buried itself under a vast mass
of throw-away consumer electronics, 
a distant ancestor will be able to prise my
slide rule out of my skeletal hand and use it perfectly well. 
</p>

<p>
Third -- and Heaven forfend this ever become relevant 
 -- a slide rule is immune to radiation, coronal mass ejection,
electromagnetic pulse effects and, quite probably, 
volcanic eruption. Just as the
sundials that we dug from the ruins of Pompeii still tell the time,
my slide rule will still work in the aftermath of whatever disaster
befall us next.  
</p>

<p>
In the end though, by using slide rules we learn something and
tune our brains. And we're following in the footsteps of the Apollo
astronauts. What better reasons could there be for preserving them?
